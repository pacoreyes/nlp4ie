We must see that there is no justification for any such feeling, and that is just what we are going to do. I think there will be enough discharged veterans, probably, with the qualifications to meet this CARDINAL-man-program that Mr. PERSON is asking for. It is a crime to--a terrible crime, in my opinion, to find these people who are hoarding money and living off the black markets, and things of that sort, when the sons of the rest of the population are out getting killed to save the country. And we are going to try to put a stop to it. I have another short statement I would like to make, with regard to prisoners of war. I wish to express my very deep sympathy for the relatives of those members of our armed forces who have the misfortune still to be held as prisoners of war by the enemy.

Protectionism, I said, costs consumers MONEY, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs. Instead of closing down markets at home and throwing NORP out of work, we should be stepping up our efforts to open markets abroad and create NORP jobs by increasing exports. I instructed ORG to begin investigations of unfair trading practices on the part of our trading partners. We have the authority to counter unfair trading practices by initiating investigations, entering negotiations, and taking active countermeasures if those negotiations are unsuccessful. CARDINAL, against a NORP law that prohibits fair competition of GPE life and fire insurance firms in the NORP market in direct contradiction of treaty obligations; CARDINAL, against a NORP law that has restricted GPE exports of computers and related products and squeezed out some NORP computer firms operating there; and CARDINAL, against restrictive practices dealing with tobacco products in GPE that unfairly block GPE entry into that market. I have also ordered acceleration of ongoing efforts to open up NORP markets in leather and leather footwear and to challenge ORG subsidies on canned fruit. On these CARDINAL cases we are setting a deadline of DATE. I have directed that a list be prepared of countermeasures which will be taken if these disputes are not resolved by then. We hope that through these negotiations we will be able to convince our trading partners to stop their unfair trading practices and open those markets that are now closed to NORP exports. We will take countermeasures only as a last resort, but our trading partners should not doubt our determination to see international trade conducted fairly with the same rules applicable to all. I am committed to and will continue to fight for fair trade. NORP exporters and NORP workers deserve a fair shake abroad, and we intend to see they get it. Our objective will always be to make world trading partnerships freer and fairer for all. So, while we will use our powers as a lever to open closed doors abroad, we will continue to resist protectionist measures that would only raise prices, lock out trade, and destroy the jobs and prosperity trade brings to all.

And I have another thought. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at GPE as the real makers of war and of peace. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house.

The second thing I think is important to note is that all the community, all the Nation will benefit, because as PERSON, our Veterans Administrator, has often pointed out, and as he was telling me coming out on the plane from GPE DATE, the work that is done in veterans hospitals makes breakthroughs that benefit all the country. For example, the treatment of so-called tropical diseases breakthroughs have been made already as a result of the work that has been done in the very difficult war in which we are presently engaged that we did not think was possible even in World War II, and more will come. So we see this hospital benefiting, as it should, first the veterans and providing better care for them, but beyond that, providing a basis for training for doctors, nurses, and others, and the basis for research which will improve the health of all the country; and then beyond that, as I have indicated, contributing to better health for all the people of the world. So I am sure you can understand why all of us at this very moment, as we make this announcement, can realize that this is an announcement that everybody can support. Without regard to party, we are all for good health. Without regard to party, we are all for better relations between nations. Without regard to party, thinking as NORP, we want to do everything that we can to help those veterans who have served our country, who have made sacrifices that we did not make ourselves.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslomalindauniversitylomalindacalifornia", "title": "Remarks at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-loma-linda-university-loma-linda-california", "publication_date": "20-08-1971", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The book tells mothers and fathers how to rehearse with their children what to say or do if they ever feel threatened. It is a practical guide to explain to children how to deal with predators that are smooth and seductive, how to deal with somebody that is a stranger that sounds sweet-talking but may in their heart be dark and dangerous for our children. The book also lists web sites that provide information about protecting children. Parents need to pay as much attention to their children, by the way, when they are on the Internet as when they are on a playground. They have got to know what their children are doing on the Internet. They have got to know with whom they are conversing. We are passing it out to the Nation's schools, and the schools will then make it available to parents.

The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit. Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men. Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work.

This legislation, carefully drafted, has now been introduced in the ORG by Senator PERSON and Congressman PERSON. It restores the fault standard, which requires that actual fault or wrongdoing must be established in most cases before liability can be assessed. It limits pain-and-suffering and punitive damage awards, awards the amount contingency-fee lawyers could earn, and restricts the joint and several liability doctrine that can force a single defendant to pay all damages even if he is only partly to blame. To be sure, much tort law would remain to be reformed by the CARDINAL States, not the Federal Government. And in our Federal system of government this is only right. Many of the ORG recommendations, for example, would have to be implemented at the State level to be fully effective. This administration's bill represents a much-needed overhaul of NORP laws governing interstate commerce CARDINAL of the fields of authority ORG is specifically granted by the Constitution and sets an example of common sense for the rest of the Nation to follow.

Perhaps my NORP background convinced me of the value of face-to-face contact, but there is no substitute for the discussions of ideas in person with community leaders such as yourselves. The best briefing paper in the world cannot explain problems as well as someone who deals with those problems on a very daily and direct basis.

As I said, you deal with deadlines, and if those deadlines are not met, then you cannot serve your readers on time. It is my judgment that the ORG must respond to some very real national deadlines.

There has been much discussion on who should receive the tax rebates--a discussion based too often on purely political considerations. I do not think we can look at this rebate on a political basis.

President PERSON, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the NORP people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the NORP people's will should be done. And so I expressed the NORP people's appreciation for this step. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in GPE. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the ORG and the ORG in GPE complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador PERSON and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process.

So I think he deserves great congratulations. Moving forward, we will continue to work with our ORG partners as well as ORG, however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the GPE that we can move GPE towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the NORP people is ultimately done.

Nothing we do, nothing we do in this great capital can change the fact that factories or information can flash across the world, that people can move money around in the blink of an eye.

For DATE, the winds of global competition have made these things clear to any NORP with eyes to see. The only way we can recover the fortunes of the middle class in this country so that people who work harder and smarter can at least prosper more, the only way we can pass on the NORP dream of DATE to our children and their children for DATE is to adapt to the changes which are occurring.

And I believe that that is many more jobs than will be lost, as inevitably some will be, as always happens when you open up the mix to a new range of competition.

There is simply no other interface that exists in GPE that allows people a portal that has questions and the capacity to geospatially identify where people are so we can identify the closest areas for mobile testing that we are aware of in the country. And so we are very encouraged by this partnership, very enthusiastic to finally announce it. I know there is been some conversations about it in the media, but it is going live DATE in TIME, fully operational in the first CARDINAL piloted areas in our state.

The turnaround is typical at ORG, anywhere from DATE, some cases DATE, is roughly the estimate. People will be automatically notified based upon that screening criteria and based upon that interface on that portal of their test results. If people have severe symptoms, this is not where we want you to be tested. If you have severe symptoms, you need to engage the medical community directly. So we want to remind people, this is not to substitute that interface, but to supplement our capacity to get people that have some mild concerns and or people that are higher risks to remove them from overburdening our healthcare delivery system, to get them out of that setting and to allow people with the kind of portability that mobile testing provides to get answers quickly.

As it relates to the purpose of developing these partnerships, the purpose of our testing that is to identify through community surveillance where we are so that we could begin to process how we need to manage the status quo and how we need to anticipate the growth and spread of the virus and look at allocating resources across the state accordingly I mentioned this DATE.

So we are looking at this from a very holistic perspective and holistic lens. We recognize that social isolation for CARDINAL of NORP is anxiety inducing, but we recognize what all of the science bears out and what we recognize around the rest of the world that we need to meet this moment head on and lean in, not isolate ourselves to this moment, but lean in and own this moment and take actions that we think are commensurate with the need to protect the most vulnerable NORP. Number CARDINAL, we are directing at all bars, nightclubs, wineries, brewpubs and the like be closed in GPE. We believe that this is a non essential function in our state, and we believe that is appropriate under the circumstances to move in that direction.

So that is on the restaurant side. Let me just briefly make this point. There is a concern around access to food for those that cannot prepare their own food. Not everybody has kind of kitchen you or I may have, not everybody is capable of heating their food. Now we are talking about home isolation. Not everybody is able now to go out to grocery store to get that food. Some may have limited capacities relates to deliveries, but we want to expand the points of access to get those deliveries.

See, I believe that when people have more money in their pocket, they will then spend or save or invest, and that causes the whole economy to grow, which then helps people find a job. Much of the tax relief we passed is set to expire, and it is set to expire right about the time the economy gets going. It makes no sense to have a tax increase on the NORP people at this stage or any stage as far as I am concerned. In order to make this tax relief permanent, let people keep more of their own money to keep driving this economy forward. Small businesses need to keep more money. You see, most new jobs in GPE are created by small-business owners. If you are worried about job creation, we need to continue to stimulate the small-business sector of our economy. They need to make these tax relief packages we passed for small business permanent so people can find work here in GPE. We also need to have an energy policy. The people of GPE understand energy. We need a policy. We need a policy that encourages conservation. We need a policy that helps modernize our electricity systems, and we need a policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. We need to open up markets for GPE' farmers and ranchers. When you are good at something, we ought to encourage the sale of those products elsewhere, outside of our markets.

Rising health care costs are making it difficult for some entities to hire people. Rising health care costs affect all NORP. Rising health care costs create insecurity in our GPE. And so we need to continue the focus on costs. We are making some good progress, by the way, about helping people with health care. We have got what we call community health centers in GPE. I am committed to the expansion and the building of new community health centers. These are places where people who do not have insurance or live in areas without enough doctors can find health care. Community health centers make sense. It takes the pressure off the emergency rooms of hospitals such as this. We have opened or expanded CARDINAL community health centers since DATE. This is a good way to make sure that health care is available for those who do not have insurance yet. And so I call upon ORG to look at that part of my budget and continue working with the administration to expand these vital centers around GPE and around GPE. And then we worked on ORG. You might remember what it was like before DATE when people talked about ORG. If somebody would talk about it, somebody else would say, Wait TIME. They are going to try to take away ORG from the seniors. I felt like we needed to deal with the issue now and not pass it on like other Congresses and administrations had done. It is time to address the issue before it became so acute that the system did not work. And it was time to fulfill a promise to our seniors, and so we acted. I was proud to sign that bill, and as I told the ORG, If you try to change it and it hurts our seniors, I will veto the bill. It is going to take a while to implement the ORG bill. It is a complex piece of legislation. After all, it is the first modernization since PERSON signed ORG in DATE. DATE, seniors are going to get a drug discount card, which will save them PERCENT off the retail price of most prescription drugs. And the lowest income seniors will get a $MONEY credit. That will help seniors with drug costs. Secondly, DATE we will begin preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease for seniors just entering ORG, plus they will get a wellness exam.

For MONEY a month, most seniors will see their drug bills cut in CARDINAL. That is a good deal for GPE's seniors. And finally, in the bill is an interesting innovation, one that is not the first time it is been tried, but it is now been expanded- they are called health savings accounts, which will allow NORP to save for future medical expenses, tax-free. Another way to help, by the way-or a way to help deal with rising costs is to understand the impact rising costs have on small businesses. A lot of big businesses are able to absorb the costs because they have got the capacity to negotiate better. When you have got a large universe of people that you are trying to cover, you can have more strength in negotiations. It gives you a better hand. The problem we have with small businesses is they do not have the capacity to pool together, to negotiate on behalf of a lot of people. And that is why I am a strong supporter of what is called association health plans that will allow small businesses to pool risk and have a better negotiation policy with those who offer insurance. ORG needs to pass this piece of legislation. It is good for the entrepreneurs of GPE. Lower income NORP should be helped with health care by refundable tax credits. It is been a part of my budget. It will help with the issue of the uninsured. People with health savings accounts, when they buy high deductible insurance policies to protect them against catastrophic medical costs or hospitalization or major surgery, should be allowed to deduct those premiums. See, that will help with the rising costs of health care as well. Those are some practical suggestions for ORG to look at, ways to strengthen the private delivery of medicine as opposed to strengthening the Government involvement in medicine. There is something else we can do at the Federal level, and that is to promote promising health information technology. The truth of the matter is, medicine is on the leading edge of change. And some of the new drugs are fantastic about-to help save lives. Some of the new machinery is fantastic.

No one DATE will order us how to vote, and the only watchers we shall find at the polls are the watchers who guarantee that our ballot is secret. But we cannot carelessly assume that a nation is strong and great merely because it has a democratic form of government. We have learned that a democracy weakened by internal dissension, by mutual suspicion born of social injustice, is no match for autocracies which are ruthless enough to repress internal dissension. Democracy in order to live must become a positive force in the daily lives of its people. It must make men and women whose devotion it seeks, feel that it really cares for the security of every individual; that it is tolerant enough to inspire an essential unity among its citizens; and that it is militant enough to maintain liberty against social oppression at home and against military aggression abroad. The rest of the world is far closer to us in every way than in DATE of democracy's founders-PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. Comparisons in this world are unavoidable. To disprove the pretenses of rival systems, democracy must be an affirmative, up-to-date conception. It can no longer be negative-no longer adopt a defeatist attitude. In these tense and dangerous situations in the world, democracy will save itself with the average man and woman by proving itself worth saving. Too many of those who prate about saving democracy are really only interested in saving things as they were. Democracy should concern itself also with things as they ought to be. I am not talking mere idealism; I am expressing realistic necessity. I reject the merely negative purposes proposed by old-line NORP and NORP alike-for they are people whose only purpose is to survive against any other NORP threat than their own.

For our part, GPE is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts.

We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests. Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination.

We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms - not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection-and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, GPE seeks peace - not war. NORP nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil. NORP pilots are crucial partners against ORG in GPE and GPE. GPE and a regional coalition have taken strong action against NORP militants in GPE. The NORP ENTITY is hunting ORG operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. NORP troops are supporting our NORP partners. In GPE, NORP troops are supporting NORP, NORP and NORP fighting together for their homeland. GPE, which hosts ORG, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with GPE and GPE continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous NORP soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the ORG, and others, in the fight for their country.

That New England had established standards of wages and of living which put some of its industries at a competitive disadvantage with sections of the country which had not reached those standards. That those lower standards were exploited by an absentee landlordism which exported from New England too much of its capital-capital that was used elsewhere to compete with industries at home. Concentrated wealth and economic power gobbled up or wiped out or moved away CARDINAL of small independent GPE businesses-the kinds of businesses with which at one time GPE had conquered the markets of the world. What did NORP leadership do to meet those difficulties? A high protective tariff alone could not help GPE meet the unfair competition from domestic competitors on the CARDINAL hand, and the unfair competition of monopoly on the other. To make matters worse, that tariff shut off the foreign commerce on which the sea coast population and industrial population of New England had lived. The full fruit of these NORP policies of DATE is found in the record of what happened to GPE industries under those policies. GPE was engulfed by the depression DATE before the rest of the country. That is GPE debt to the NORP leadership of the boom era. What has this Administration done? We have raised wages and living standards in other sections of the country. They are being brought up toward the standards of New England. That kind of unfair competition is being destroyed. Most of us are in favor of that. We have begun the first real offensive in our history against that concentrated wealth and monopolistic power which almost destroyed the small businesses and diversified industries of New England. Most of us are in favor of that. By reciprocal trade agreements, we have begun to reopen foreign markets for New England products and New England shipping and trade. Most of us are in favor of that. We have increased the purchasing power of New England's customers out on the farms and in the cities of the Nation. And most of us are in favor of that. New England has traditionally been a land of moderate-sized independent business, a land of economic democracy. Its farseeing statesmen have always understood that democracy was impossible under the relentless pressure of concentration and monopoly wielded by the new power of high finance.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbostonmass", "title": "Address at Boston, Mass.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-boston-mass", "publication_date": "21-10-1936", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

But in every instance each knew that the other one was contributing, and the children understood the function of the parents, and the parents understood and loved the children. And in our relatively primitive, isolated state of living, we were bound together by love. I first heard the Bible read in my family. I first heard prayer in my family. I learned about God within the family. There, in an embryonic stage of growth, I began to perceive the world around me. And when I had questions, they were answered.

And sometimes fathers leave homes temporarily, through subterfuge, sometimes permanently, just so a child can be fed. In our modern, mobile, permissive society, the basic moral strengths that bind families together are sometimes weakened or broken entirely. For every CARDINAL marriages that took place in GPE DATE, there was CARDINAL divorce. For people born in DATE and later married, CARDINAL out of CARDINAL marriages resulted in divorce. For NORP born since World War II who married, CARDINAL out of CARDINAL marriages results in divorce. Teenage suicide has doubled in DATE, and now the second most prevalent cause of death among male teenagers is suicide. Births out of wedlock are increasing rapidly. But these brutal and disturbing statistics are caused by a lack of strength among family members. PERSON says as a joke, We are all in this alone. And sometimes we feel that in a fast-moving, modern, technological society that we are alone, not as it was in former generations because of separation of distance because now we can be alone in a crowded apartment building, because our next-door neighbors remain strangers. All of us have weaknesses, faults, fears, yearnings, hopes, dreams, ideals that we cannot realize alone, and the support and the concern and the understanding and the care and, sometimes, the criticism and punishment in a constructive way help to repair our weaknesses.

It was instantly made nation-wide, so far as the organized mine workers could control, and included many districts in the bituminous field where there was neither grievance nor dispute, and effected a complete tie-up of the production in the anthracite field. It is to be noted that when the suspension began large stocks of coal were on hand, mined at wages higher than those paid during the war, there was only the buying impelled by necessity, and there was a belief that coal must yield to the postwar readjustment.

Accordingly, a conference of the coal operators' associations and the general and district officials of ORG was called, to meet in GPE on DATE. The designation of representation was left to the officials of the various organizations, and there was nation-wide representation, except from the nonunion fields of the country. Before the joint meeting I expressed the deep concern of the country and invited them to meet at a conference table and end the disputes between them. The conference did not develop even a hope. The operators were asking for their district or territorial conferences; the workers demanded national settlement on old bases. Appraising correctly the hopelessness of the situation, I again invited both operators and workers to meet with me, and tendered a means of settlement so justly inspired that it was difficult to see how anyone believing in industrial peace and justice to all concerned could decline it. In substance, it called on the operators to open their mines, on the mine workers to resume work at the same pay and under the same working conditions as prevailed at the time the strike began. In turn, the Government was to create at once a coal commission, or CARDINAL of them, if preferred by all parties to the dispute, so that one could deal with the bituminous situation, the other with the problems in the anthracite field. The commission was to be instructed to direct its first inquiry to the rate of wage to be paid for the period ending DATE, and then to enter upon a fact-finding inquiry into every phase of the industry, and point the way to avoid future suspensions in production.

There are fundamental evils in our present system of producing and distribution which make the wage problem difficult.

I am speaking now on behalf of mine workers, mine operators, and the NORP public.

The Government will gladly cooperate with the industry in this program so far as it is the public interest so to do, but I have an unalterable conviction that no lasting satisfaction or worth-while results will ensue unless we may have a Government commission, independent of the industry, clothed with authority by the ORG to search deeply, so that it may advise as to fair wages and as to conditions of labor and recommend the enactment of laws to protect the public in the future. The almost total exhaustion of stocks of coal, the crippled condition of the railways, the distressed situation that has arisen and might grow worse in our great cities due to the shortage of anthracite, the suffering which might arise in the Northwest through failure to meet the DATE needs by lake transportation, all these added to the possibility of outrageous price demands, in spite of the most zealous voluntary efforts of the Government to restrain them, make it necessary to ask you to consider at once some form of temporary control of distribution and prices.

I do not mean that all interstate coal shall be handled by such a federal organization; perhaps none will be necessary; but it will restore its capital to ORG and will be the instrumentality of guarding the public interest where private conscience is insensible to a public need. This proposal does not relate to any possible employment in intrastate shipments. Price restraint and equitable distribution in intrastate shipments is a responsibility of the state's own government. In such voluntary activities as have been carried on thus far the federal Government has endeavored to reestablish the authority and responsibility in the states which was undermined in the necessary centralization of authority during the World War. The public menace in the coal situation was made more acute and more serious at DATE by the strike of ORG in the railroad service-a strike against a wage decision made by ORG, directly affecting CARDINAL men. The justice of the decision is not for discussion here. The decision has been lost sight of in subsequent developments. In any event, it was always possible to appeal for rehearing and the submission of new evidence, and it is always a safe assumption that a Government agency of adjustment deciding unjustly will be quick to make right any wrong. ORG was created by ORG for the express purpose of hearing and deciding disputes between the carriers and their employees, so that no controversy need lead to an interruption in interstate transportation. Wages had, mounted upward, necessarily and justly, during the war upheaval, likewise the cost of transportation, so that the higher wages might be paid. It only held that ORG was the lawful agency of the Government to hear and decide disputes, and its authority must be sustained, as the law contemplates. This must be so, whether the carriers or the employees ignore its decisions. Unhappily a number of decisions of this board had been ignored by the carriers. In CARDINAL instance, however, had a decision, challenged by a carrier, been brought to the attention of ORG, and this decision was promptly carried to the courts and has recently been sustained in the federal ORG. The public or the ORG had no knowledge of the ignored decisions in other cases, because they did not hinder transportation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

The law creating ORG is inadequate. Contrary to popular impression, it has little or no power to enforce its decisions. It can impose no penalties on either party disregarding its decisions. It cannot halt a strike, and manifestly ORG deliberately omitted the enactment of compulsory arbitration. The decisions of the board must be made enforceable and effective against carriers and employees alike. But the law is new, and no perfection of it by ORG at this moment could be helpful in the present threatened paralysis of transportation. Happily it is always lawful and ofttimes possible to settle disputes outside of court, so, in a desire to serve public welfare, I ventured upon an attempt at mediation. Those who had preceded me in attempted settlements had made some progress. I submitted to the officials of the striking employees and the chairman of ORG, in writing, on DATE, a tentative proposal for settlement. Knowing that some of the carriers had offended by ignoring the decisions of the board, and the employees had struck when they had a remedy without the strike, I felt it was best to start all over again, resume work, all to agree to abide faithfully by the board's decisions, make it a real tribunal of peace in transportation, and everybody serve the public. The barrier to be surmounted was the question of seniority. By the workmen these rights are held to be sacred, and unsurrendered by a strike. By the carriers the preservation of seniority is the weapon of discipline on the CARDINAL hand and the reward of faithful employees on the other. In the tentative proposal which I sponsored it was provided that everybody should go to work, with seniority rights unimpaired, that there should be no discrimination by either workmen or carriers against workmen who did or did not strike. I realized that the proposal must carry a disappointment to employees who had inherited promotion by staying loyally on the job, and to such new men as had sought jobs looking to permanent employment, but I wanted the fresh start and maintained transportation service, and I appraised the disappointment of the few to be less important than the impending misfortune to the nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

I believed the sacrifice brought to the men involved could be amply compensated for by the carriers in practical ways. I believed that the matter of transcendent importance was the acceptance of the proposal to respect ORG decisions on the questions which formed the issue at the time of the strike. The public compensation would be complete in guarding by law against recurrence. The proposal was rejected by the carriers. Though the rejection did not end all negotiation, it left the Government only, CARDINAL course- to call the striking workmen to return to work, to call the carriers to assign them to work, and leave the dispute about seniority to ORG for decision. When negotiation or mediation fails, this is the course contemplated by the law and the Government can have no chart for its course except the law. To this call a majority of the carriers responded favorably, proposing to reemploy all strikers except those guilty of violence against workmen or property, to restore the striking workmen to their old positions where vacant, or to like positions where vacancies are filled; questions of seniority which can not be settled between the employer and employees to go to ORG for decision. The minority of the carriers proposed to assign jobs to workmen on strike only where the positions were vacant. Thus the narrative brings us to the present moment, but it has not included the developments which have heightened the Government's concern. Sympathetic strikes have developed here and there, seriously impairing interstate commerce. Deserted transcontinental trains in the desert regions of the Southwest have revealed the cruelty and contempt for law on the part of some railway employees, who have con-spired to paralyze transportation, and lawlessness and violence in a CARDINAL places have revealed the failure of the striking unions to hold their forces to law observance. Men who refused to strike and who have braved insult and assault and risked their lives to serve the public need have been cruelly attacked and wounded or killed.

Under these conditions of hindrance and intimidation there has been such a lack of care of motive power that the deterioration of locomotives and the noncompliance with the safety requirements of the law are threatening the breakdown of transportation. This very serious menace is magnified by the CARDINAL of losses to fruit growers and other producers of perishable foodstuffs, and comparable losses to farmers who depend on transportation to market their grains at harvest time. Even worse, it is hindering the transport of available coal when industry is on the verge of paralysis because of coal shortage, and life and health are menaced by coal famine in the great centers of population. Surely the threatening conditions must impress the ORG and the country that no body of men, whether limited in numbers and responsible for railway management or powerful in numbers and the necessary forces in railroad operation, shall be permitted to choose a course which so imperils public welfare. Neither organizations of employers nor workingmen's unions may escape responsibility. When related to a public service the mere fact of organization magnifies that responsibility and public interest transcends that of either grouped capital or organized labor. Another development is so significant that the hardships of the moment may well be endured to rivet popular attention to necessary settlement. It is fundamental to all freedom that all men have unquestioned rights to lawful pursuits, to work and to live and choose their own lawful ways to happiness. In these strikes these rights have been denied by assault and violence, by armed lawlessness. In many communities the municipal authorities have winked at these violations, until liberty is a mockery and the law a matter of community contempt. It is fair to say that the great mass of organized workmen do not approve, but they seem helpless to hinder. These conditions can not remain in free GPE.

For DATE, you have advocated on behalf of those without a voice. For despite the real gains that we have made, there is still laws to change, and there is still hearts to open. There are still fellow citizens, perhaps neighbors, even loved ones, good and decent people, who hold fast to outworn arguments and old attitudes, who fail to see your families like their families, who would deny you the rights most NORP take for granted. And yet you continue, leading by the force of the arguments you make and by the power of the example that you set in your own lives as parents and friends, as ORG members and church members, as advocates and leaders in your communities. And you are making a difference. That is the story of the movement for fairness and equality and not just for those who are gay, but for all those in our history who've been denied the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, for all who've been told that the full blessings and opportunities of this country were closed to them. It is the story of progress sought by those with little influence or power, by men and women who brought about change through quiet, personal acts of compassion and defiance wherever and whenever they could. It is the story of the Stonewall protests, when a group of citizens with a few options when a group of citizens with few options and fewer supporters stood up against discrimination and helped to inspire a movement.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthehumanrightscampaignannualdinner", "title": "Remarks at the Human Rights Campaign Annual Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-human-rights-campaign-annual-dinner", "publication_date": "10-10-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It is elemental to the principles that he put forward. It is reflected in the bipartisan bill that passed the ORG. And the President strongly believes that it needs to be a part of comprehensive immigration reform. We have long said that the ORG would necessarily pursue its own path in the construction of an immigration reform package, but comprehensive immigration reform is essential because the whole works together in a way that achieves all of the important benefits to the economy and to the country that we are looking for with the passage of this legislation. So I am not going to get into a lot of parsing of what ifs because we have not seen a thing out of the ORG yet, and we are looking forward to the ORG acting on the urges we have heard expressed and the interest and desire that we have heard expressed by NORP, including NORP leaders on this matter.

So whatever the legislative process, not parsing that, the final bill that he would sign into law must include a path to citizenship? We have said all along that comprehensive immigration reform needs to include a path to citizenship. And he will not sign a law that is short of that?

And then on the ORG, I have heard you and I have heard others at ORG talk about the ORG as having a good record on dealing with the backlog of claims and actually praising the ORG on this issue.

If you were a veteran of the first Gulf War and you felt that you were a victim of problems associated with exposure in that war, and if you were a veteran of GPE or GPE and you experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, again, your claim would clear a hurdle automatically under this process that we established in this administration because we believe our veterans deserve it. That immediately increased the population of people who had disability claims added to the backlog, and that backlog has been a focus of intense work and attention by the ORG and the administration in general. On the matter of the absolute requirement that our veterans get the health care and services that they deserve and they get that in a timely fashion, the revelations or at least the allegations that have emerged from the situation in GPE I think have been greeted, in terms of reaction in the manner that Secretary PERSON suggested DATE, with a great deal of anger and frustration.

It is reflected in some of the decisions that were made to increase access to disability claims and to health care. We have under his leadership reduced veterans homelessness by PERCENT. We have provided Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to CARDINAL students. And we have decreased the disability claims. My point is that when I talk about the progress that has been made, I have been referring to questions about Secretary PERSON and his leadership of ORG, and that progress has come on his watch and he certainly deserves credit for it. Do you think it sounds strange, though, that given the evidence that we are seeing coming out and suggestions that veterans have actually died waiting to get health services -- I think the word you used is essential because you said the suggestion.

And that is an opinion shared by the President, by Secretary PERSON, and I think everyone else who has looked at this matter and works on these issues. Why has not he expressed it?

Does ORG have anything on that? I did not see that comment. What I think you know is that the President asked Secretary PERSON to address -- to review procedures when it comes to enforcement, and that review is underway. I would refer you to the department for any status update they might have. And also DATE, there were some documents released to ORG through ORG -- a lawsuit -- that did appear that the GPE office of ORG did have more to do with targeting some of the tea party groups in this. I did not see that report, so I do not have a response. Well, does ORG still believe that this was entirely out of the GPE office, as the President said during the Super Bowl interview? Our position has not changed and I certainly have not seen any facts that suggest otherwise. But I have not seen the report that you mentioned. I am just curious about this sports concussion event. And what is the President hoping to get out of it? We hope to see and expect to see some public and private commitments made towards the study of and education about this problem. I think the President, as a father who also has on his staff others who are parents, knows that this is a topic that a lot of families are discussing right now as more and more information is provided about the problems associated with concussions in sports, especially for our young. And we have the ability here, because it is ORG and because he is the President, to help elevate this issue and help draw attention to it and support for efforts to make progress on it so that we can ensure that our kids are being able to get all the benefits that come from participating in sports but are able to do so in as safe a way as possible. I do not have a list of attendees at this time. What I can tell you is we are not prepared to announce participants or commitments at this time, but the President recognizes that raising awareness of and better protecting children and student athletes from concussions, and better identifying and treating them when they do occur requires a team approach. And professional sports leagues, including the ORG, are certainly vital members of that team.

So this is something that I think a lot of families spend a lot of time worrying about and want to know as much as they can about, and want to be sure that they are taking all the precautions they can on behalf of their children so their children can get all the great experiences that come from participating in sports. How does he prepare for an event like this? Is he reading books? ORG has done some documentaries.

Do you think it is time for Lady Liberty to put up her hand and say Stop to immigration at the NORP border? I think that well, at any border. I think that something very definite would go out of GPE if we ever forgot our heritage. That is sort of like all of us came here from someplace else or by way of our ancestors-our parents, grandparents, and so forth and that is a little like getting on board and once we are on board let us pull up the gangplank and not let anyone else on. Does that mean you would not support the immigration bill that is now Oh, I am supporting the immigration bill because I think we have to have rules and regulations, and I think what that bill is meant to correct is some loss of control at our borders, where illegal immigration is threatening us now. No, we have to have control and have had; it is been traditional in our country for DATE. And I agree with that, and I agree with the part of the legislation which says that some people even if they did illegally enter the country in times past have established themselves, have been law-abiding, raised children, and so forth here that there should be a provision whereby their status can be made legal and permanent. DATE, which is a celebration of liberty and our 100th anniversary of our lady in the harbor, do you feel that NORP blacks should have that same kind of liberation?

What we believe is that there must come a meeting and negotiations between leaders of the various black elements and the present government as to the formation of a government. Now, they have taken such steps as single citizenship already. They have done some things about the onerous pass laws and all of that the right of labor unions and so forth. They have arrested all the labor union leaders though, sir. I know, and this was part of, again, this emergency thing that we think should be done away with. But I think the complication that is overlooked too often is that it is not solidly a racial division between the white minority and the black majority. The black majority itself is divided, and there are tribal divisions that have a long time heritage there in Africa. And we have seen that in the violence between those groups now. Is there something GPE can do to bring that about? Well, we are continuing to try, and I think that we have a better chance by remaining in contact with that government than following the lead that is been suggested up on the ORG with some legislation in which we would walk totally away and then be on the outside with no contact at all.

Well, first of all, PERSON sent those people after Pearl Harbor, after there was an attack and after GPE declared war on GPE, when the whole future of Europe was at stake. What has happened here is that NORP nations under the ORG mandate have gone into GPE not for the purpose of ending the war but for the purpose of preserving the ORG mission of preserving some limitation on the fighting and some humanitarian aid. We have acted in support of that in several ways. We have provided through our air power the longest humanitarian airlift in history, now longer than the GPE airlift. We have worked hard to get our ORG allies to agree to use not only the threat but the reality of air power to stop the war in GPE from spreading to the air. We have shot down planes in aid of that objective to protect GPE and other safe areas. And we are aggressively involved with our NORP allies in trying to get a peace agreement. I do not think it is an appropriate thing for GPE to send ground troops to GPE to become involved in the conflict itself. Now, if we reach an agreement in which ORG has a responsibility to enforce the agreement along lines agreed to by the parties, that is a different matter altogether. GPE still has troops in the Middle East enforcing the agreement reached by GPE and GPE at the FAC accord.

I think the NORP have done the right thing in putting their troops in in the ORG mandate to try to limit the fighting. But in the end, these parties are going to have to make an agreement. Otherwise, there is a risk that they will collapse the ORG mission. They are going to have to decide that they cannot win, either side, by fighting and make an agreement.

I said that any discussion of that, any discussion of that, could not proceed until there was some sort of cessation of hostilities and that I personally would not favor changing the position of GPE, which is that that embargo should not be lifted until there is a peace agreement in force in GPE and some other changes have occurred in GPE. I have not changed our position. With regard to lifting the arms embargo, I have always thought that the arms embargo was unfair to ORG, always. That has been my position from DATE. I have also always thought that GPE should not unilaterally lift it, from DATE. Our NORP allies have not favored lifting it for good reasons. They have soldiers on the ground there. There are NORP soldiers in GPE; they do not want them subject to attack, to capture because the arm's embargo has been lifted. Therefore, I do not think the global community will vote to lift the arms embargo unless the ORG mission collapses. What I said about the arms embargo was quite simple, and that is that I think it is a possibility if the ORG mission does not succeed. I said what I did in hopes that we could spur the NORP to understand that they are going to have to make a reasonable agreement or fight a very long war.

The decision to let him come was plainly taking a risk for peace. I think that ORG ought to renounce violence and ought to join the peace process. I am very frankly pleased that at long last they issued their questions and ORG provided answers and all that is been published. And I am hoping that after the DATE elections, that we will see some real progress there. But I do not think we can know yet whether the decision was or was not a mistake in terms of what will happen over the long run. I think plainly it was designed to further the debate, and I hope it did that. Finally, ENTITY, you go to Europe at a time when you are facing the kind of criticism, sleazy criticism, at home and in the NORP papers that no President has ever had to face before. How distracting is it for you that people are raking up financial dealings and personal affairs going back DATE? Well, unfortunately that is become part of the daily fare of NORP public life now because of certain extremist groups and because now it is part of our media life, like unfortunately it is a part of your media life. But I know that the charges are bogus and that they will ultimately be disproved or they will die of their own weight. And they do not take up a lot of our time and attention here.

We have already taped that segment. What do you think? It is not easy ever to make these kinds of tough decisions. There are MONEY in budget cuts in that bill that affect everything from agriculture to veterans, to ORG, to virtually all the specific programs in the ORG. And this will bring the deficit down by MONEY, and it will keep these long-term interest rates coming down, which is what is so necessary if we are going to have reinvestment in our country and rebuild the manufacturing sector and get this economy going again. And those who have tried to fashion other alternatives have come up with programs that hurt the vulnerable in our country and the middle class more and hurt the business economy more. And I think that is why we have had people from companies representing the automakers to high-tech companies in GPE supporting the program. It is a little-known thing that CARDINAL the CARDINAL biggest companies in the country have supported the program, that the labor organizations have supported it, that the home builders organization, a largely NORP group, have supported it because it will bring interest rates down and create jobs and incomes for the NORP people. But if it does pass the ORG, and apparently Senator PERSON feels you have enough votes, CARDINAL or more votes, it has to go back to the ORG. It is been changed significantly from the bill approved by the ORG. We hear ORG may be falling out of step. Can it pass the entire ORG?

And I expect it to pass both ORG. Like I said, these are difficult times, because for DATE the NORP people have been told one thing and had another thing happen where the debt just kept getting bigger and bigger, and it is eating us alive. And interest rates were high, and we could not get investment. We could not get jobs. We are going to turn it around, but it is not easy. A couple of things started to leak out DATE on those DATE GPE shows. CARDINAL item was that entertainers and sports people, people who make big salaries for usually a relatively short period of time, would be exempt from the new higher rate of income tax. Apparently it was on ORG or CARDINAL of those shows DATE. I think what you are going to find is that people who make a lot of money for DATE may wind up doing something that many of them already do, by the way, which is structuring their contracts so they get paid over DATE than they play. But I know of no exemptions for any high income people. And the surtax on the capital gains tax, everyone was figuring maybe there will be a capital gains cut. That is in the ORG bill. But I am not sure how it will come out in the end. I think CARDINAL thing you can look forward to is a so-called venture capital gains on new business capital gains tax, where people who put their money into new businesses will be given big incentives to do so. That is, if you take a risk on somebody and you start a new venture and you hire some new people to create new jobs in the economy and you hold that investment for DATE, you will be able to reduce your tax liability if, in fact, it turns out to be successful.

I heard that over and over TIME. Let me just mention CARDINAL or CARDINAL things that should be reassuring to small businesses. If these provisions of my plan pass, first of all, anybody who starts a new venture will be able to get investment for that new venture. And if the investment is held for DATE, the tax rates will be much, much lower than the ordinary income tax rates, if it passes. Secondly, for ongoing small businesses, DATE the write-off for expensing on the tax form is $MONEY per year. We propose to raise that to $MONEY. That will be a substantial reduction in the tax burden of most small businesses and will be an encouragement, I think, for them to hire more people. Thirdly, if someone has a chain of restaurants, for example, like the person who called in, in the plan that I presented to the ORG that ORG adopted, we have some changes in the alternative minimum tax provisions which operate as real incentives for people to continue to invest their profits in the expansion of their businesses without running up bigger tax bills. So I would urge the small business people who are listening to us to really look at what is in that ORG bill. There are a lot of very strong pro-business and pro-small business provisions in the bill that have not gotten a lot of attention. That is why, let me just mention, ORG and ORG, CARDINAL groups not normally associated with ORG, have already strongly endorsed this economic program because of the incentives for economic growth and because it is bringing down long-term interest rates. Any business person who has to borrow money in all probability is going to save more money in lower-interest rates than they will pay in higher taxes.

What are you doing or what can you do to get Senator PERSON's vote? And do you think you will ultimately get it? I do not know the answer to the last question, but what I have done is to try to take the strengths of both ORG and ORG versions of the bill and try to put them together. The strength of the ORG version was it had fewer overall taxes and was even more progressive. The strength of the ORG version was it had much more economic incentives, more economic growth incentives, for research and development, for investment in new firms, for small business, the things of that kind. So the argument that I am going to be making to all these Senators is that this plan now clearly has MONEY in deficit reduction; it will now have more spending cuts than tax increases in it; it will have PERCENT of the new tax burden now borne by people with incomes above $MONEY; that the middle class tax burden is now down to $MONEY a year; and that the economic growth incentives qualifying, for example, PERCENT plus of the small businesses in the country for a reduction in taxes if they invest more in their companies; and enabling the working poor through the earned-income tax credit to lift themselves above poverty by working full time The people who are leaning against this program or have announced against it-not the NORP, that is almost entirely a political deal; the NORP have even opposed the conservative amendments to our budget to control entitlements and impose discipline. There are those who think it is the right thing for the country, but they are afraid there is been so much misinformation out there about it that they will get beat if they vote for it. The only thing I would say to the latter group is that we do have to do something on entitlements, but we cannot get there until we do something to reform health care spending overall, and that this is a major step that will stabilize the financial markets, keep interest rates down, and enable us to move on to health care reform, to getting a world trade agreement, to welfare reform, to the crime bill, to all these things that are out there crying for attention that we cannot even address if we do not go ahead and get this budget out of the way.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "title": "Interview With Newspaper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-newspaper-editors-0", "publication_date": "02-08-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And ORG has already cut another MONEY off the budget that we cannot fully count yet because the ORG has not acted. But when they do, we will have even more cuts. Let me pass on to you a question I am getting increasingly from Constitution readers. How can you assure that your tax increase package does not have the same result as Mr. PERSON's DATE tax increase package, which is to say no result at all except higher taxes? I can do that in CARDINAL ways. First of all, let us look at what happened in DATE. Why did the deficit reduction package in DATE not produce the deficit reduction it was intended to? But CARDINAL big reason is that they overestimated how much the revenues would bring in; that is, they had some very, very liberal revenue estimates, and those revenues did not materialize. So that within DATE after the package passed, they revised downward the amount of deficit reduction by MONEY. Now, we have instead taken the most conservative revenue estimates we could get. The second thing is that I have pledged to the ORG that by Executive order, I will put all of this money, the spending cuts and the revenue increases, into a trust fund and that every year if we miss the deficit reduction target, I will come forward to the ORG and give them a plan to meet the target, that is, to have further cuts to meet the target, and ask them to vote on it. I might say that we had those requirements in the law, and through the parliamentary rules of the ORG, the NORP took it out of the law. PERCENT of the NORP agree with that budgetary discipline, and they took it out because they thought it was good politics for them to take it out and weaken the bill further. So I am going to do it by Executive order. Now, let me say, there was CARDINAL other thing different from DATE. Because this plan has been taken much more seriously by the financial markets, it has already had a big impact in bringing down long-term interest rates, and that has led CARDINAL of people to refinance their homes and their business loans.

So there are a lot of pro-growth incentives in this plan that were not there in DATE, and those are the principal differences. PERSON is saying that this proposal should be rejected so Members of ORG can go back home, visit with their constituents, get a better feel for the spending cuts that would be accepted, come back in DATE and cut some more. Well, because we have already got more spending cuts than revenue increases, number CARDINAL; because we are going to keep cutting spending, as I have said.

Sir, there is been a good bit of discussion about the timing of the spending cuts, particularly saying that they mostly come in DATE. Could you please comment on the timing of the spending cuts? Well, they were not timed to do that. The fact is that we have more control- when I took over this budget-these budgets are done on a DATE cycle. If you are going to make deep cuts, it is easier to plan for them if you have a little time to plan for them. And also under the previous budget that we inherited, the budgets were already tighter in DATE, and they were much looser, I thought, in DATE. But I assure you, we are not waiting for that. I have already given instructions to my ORG to prepare more budget cuts for DATE. We have reduced the deficit in DATE since I have been in office, mostly because of lower interest rates, by MONEY over and above where it was projected to be. So there are budget cuts in DATE, but it is like planning anything else. If you are going to take big whacks out of a large organization, the longer time goes on, the more you have to plan, the bigger the cuts you can make. Now, let me say CARDINAL other thing.

I think we need to reform the health care system. The people who talk about spending cuts first are basically saying this. We are cutting defense sharply and about all we can. I am concerned that we should not do more. We have cut it quite deeply. For example, that means every dollar we increase ORG, every dollar we increase education and training for workers that have been displaced by defense plants closing down, every dollar we put into new technologies for defense conversion-those are the CARDINAL areas where we basically have increased-we have to cut in veterans affairs, in agriculture, in all these other areas. Already we have a budget that will reduce the ORG work force by CARDINAL people in DATE, and there will be more cuts coming to that, so that is flat. The only thing that is increasing in this budget are the so-called entitlements, and that is basically ORG and ORG and ORG cost of living. We have restrained ORG pay increases and ORG pension increases below where they have been under the previous administrations. They are getting some cost of living, but less than they ordinarily would, and I called for a freeze in DATE. So the real growth is in ORG and ORG, in the health care programs. If you put a lid on them now without reforming the health care system, you must do CARDINAL of CARDINAL things that I think are not good. CARDINAL is to charge middle class elderly people more for their ORG and much more if you are going to make them pay it all. Or the second is to not charge them any more, just limit how much ORG pays, and force the doctors and hospitals to shift all the costs to the private sector, which would raise the health insurance premiums of every newspaper on this telephone. That is what is been going on for DATE. I do not dispute those who say if you want to take the deficit from where I take it to down to CARDINAL, you have to deal with entitlements.

And if push comes to shove, how would you put them in priority of importance if you have to keep CARDINAL and get rid of one? Well, let me just say this. They are both very important to me for different reasons. And I think they are both important to the country. I think, if you are asking how they are doing now, I think the space station is more secure than the super collider, because the space station passed a ORG vote.

So we have redesigned the space station after a serious review by an eminent team of national scientists. It is very important to maintain our leadership in space technology. It is very important in terms of new partnerships with GPE to keep them involved in this kind of technology, to reduce the incentive they have to sell weapons and keep them taking their nuclear force down. But most important, it is a big economic boom to us. If we get out of this, the NORP will move right in, take this over, and have a lot of those high-wage jobs that NORP should have. The super collider is important, in my judgment, for science and for research, not so much for applied technology now. We do not know for sure what it will produce, but we know that it has the potential to produce a great deal, and we know that other major science research projects like this have often had unintended benefits. It is in more trouble now. And frankly, whether we can save it or not depends entirely on whether we can save it in the ORG. I think then-Senator PERSON clearly saved it in the ORG last time.

Senator PERSON, for example-we have got ORG on here- Senator PERSON is sort of in that category, you know, said you have got to deal with entitlement costs, too. And my argument to that group of people-and that is the argument that Senator PERSON made DATE-is that you are right, it does not do enough. But that is not a good reason to vote against this because what it does is very good, indeed. And unless you do this, you cannot get to the second stage. That is, I completely agree we have to control entitlement costs and that that begins overwhelmingly with ORG and ORG costs. I just do not think it is fair or right to do it unless it is part of an overall health care reform plan which brings down the cost of health care to all NORP and stops cost-shifting and does not impose unfair burdens on elderly people on ORG. And my argument is, we are just beginning this process; we are not ending it.

ENTITY, since you brought up health care reform, what do you say to reassure NORP-looming over this budget package with its various tax increases is the specter of more increases to pay for health care. How can you reassure NORP that they are not getting ready to get hit by a CARDINAL punch? First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured. Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what is going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I do not , myself, think that it is right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we are going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we are going to bring our costs down, we have got to cover everybody. An employer should bear some responsibility for their employees. And the employee should bear some responsibility, too. But my own view of that is that the best way to do that is to limit the ultimate cost to small business and phase any new requirements in over DATE so that nobody is adversely affected too much.

Well, what I said was once I banned these enhanced interrogation techniques, which I had said were torture, that is not something we are going to be doing moving forward after I had issued that edict. But unfortunately, as the ORG report shows, we engaged in some brutal activity after 9/11, and, you know, this is an accounting of some of the problems that the ORG program engaged in. I recognize that there is controversies in terms of some of the details, but what is not controversial is the fact that we did some things that violated who we are as a people. And I know that there have been concerns about the release of this report and the potential dangers it poses. We have taken precautionary measures in our embassies and around the world. There is never a perfect time to release a report like this, but it was important for , I think, to recognize that part of what sets apart is when we do something wrong, we acknowledge it. Is this the responsibility of President PERSON? Did he betray NORP values? Well, as I have said before, after 9/11, I do not think that you can know what it feels like to know that GPE's gone through the worst attack on the continental GPE in its history. So there were a lot of people who did a lot of things right and worked very hard to keep safe, but I think that any fair-minded person looking at this would say that some terrible mistakes were made in allowing these kinds of practices to take place. In part becae, I think, study after study has shown that when people get tortured, when people are beaten, when people are put in a position of severe stress and pain, oftentimes they are willing to say anything to alleviate that stress and pain.

We are going to focus on new arrivals. Because one of the things that I think is important to understand is that although we are reprioritizing to make sure that we are not in the business of separating families, we are still sending a message to people who have not yet come here, we are going to be enforcing those immigration laws so that newcomers, people who just arrived, you are likely to be sent back.

It struck me as interesting that GPE now has got good enough relations with both-with countries like GPE and GPE and GPE to effect policy which helps our mutual security and our economy-and economy.

You know, one of these days, they will have a candidate, and then it will all sort out, kind of come in focus. Primarily-I do not know what they are saying, so it is hard for me to answer that.

And I have worked hard to be a sensitive, open-minded person to that end. A lot of people in GPE talk about this. Looking ahead, do you think it is important for the NORP people to sort of view GPE mostly as a strategic competitor or more as a partner? I would call it a-I would-I think as we look ahead I would view it as a management of a complex relationship, where sometimes our national interests are aligned and sometimes our national interests are not aligned. They could-and let me just talk about the economy, for example. And CARDINAL reason I call it a complex relationship is that here in GPE, trade with GPE is not necessarily universally accepted as good. It is universally accepted as good in this administration. I mean, free and fair trade is good for the world, and I believe it is good for this relationship. But it is a-some in GPE view the advent of NORP manufacturing, particularly at the lower end of the economic scale, as direct competition with their own livelihood, thereby making the relationship complex. Energy-what is very interesting is that if you view GPE as a market, you want them to become more robust and more prosperous. But in order to do that, GPE is going to have to have more energy, and as GPE demands more energy, it creates more global demand relative to a slower growing supply, means higher prices for us all. It is a very interesting and important relationship made complex by globalization, and their constantly changing internal situation, particularly when it comes their economy. I am sure you have been reading about the GPE discussions. On the CARDINAL hand, we have got very good relations. On the other hand, it was hard to find common ground to get the GPE deal closed. So it is hard to label the relationship CARDINAL way or the other. An NORP President is going to have to pay very close attention to relations with not only GPE, but the region. And I say the region because if it ever-if the perception is ever that GPE is fixated only on GPE, then you are going to have issues with long-time allies, people that have been counting on the NORP support for a period of time. And so never can the foreign policy be viewed as CARDINAL sum.

And I believe I will be leaving office with the Far East in as good as shape as it can be from a GPE perspective. I understand it is a headache and you are sprinting as fast as you can, but NORP does not seem like they are keeping up with the pace. So maybe you could give me some more breaking news on this end. Sprinting is CARDINAL thing; undermining good policy is another. And multilateral diplomacy is the best way to peacefully solve an issue such as the nuclearization or the weaponization or the desire to have a nuclear weapon program by NORP. I will do nothing to undermine the CARDINAL-party structure, the credibility of the CARDINAL-party structure, and our partners. And therefore, to answer your question, we are very clear that in order to move forward in the phase that we are now in- and this is a phased-in deal-that there must be verification that we are all happy with, a verification mechanism on not only plutonium, but also highly enriched uranium, as well as proliferation. And we will obviously consult very closely with our partners. This will be a subject of discussion with the President. As you know, I am a believer in human dignity and human rights. I discuss it with all leaders. And I am-for example, when it comes to GPE, we have constantly asked GPE not to send people back into GPE. I want to thank the NORP people for welcoming their brothers and sisters who have been able to escape. It is what they need to do. We thank you for-- We need to open up-we have opened up our doors. And the first step-the CARDINAL things on my mind now in GPE are getting rid of the nuclear weapons program, which, as you know, can be very destabilizing. When GPE fires rockets or tests, it creates reverberations around the immediate area. And secondly, is to recognize-constantly keep in mind the human rights violations that take place there.

There is a difference about how hard people should push for democracy in GPE. I am at CARDINAL end of the ledger.

CARDINAL thing that interests me is to watch GPE's leaders deal with the benefits and challenges of a marketplace. In other words, this is a country that has got a lot of mouths to feed and a lot of people to employ. And they are committed to, in many ways, marketplace principles, particularly as they have invited in foreign capital. And it is been interesting to watch them deal with a combination of the need for raw material versus the-from the foreign policy implications of dealing with a country that has a lot of raw material. The classic case is GPE, where I have spent a lot of time with the NORP President talking about the dangers of GPE having a nuclear weapon, knowing full well that they need fuel in order to meet their own internal pressures. PERSON has been very open in many ways about his concerns and the pressures he feels, as have I. And by the way, that is not easy when there is a language barrier. And yet I can report to you that we do have cordial, relaxed conversations in spite of the fact that we both have interpreters. It is much easier when you are dealing with a person that speaks your own language. Since the only one I speak is English, it is important to have English speakers. But here is a man who I have had some-I feel comfortable talking about his family, and he asks about mine. And that may sound trite to you, but nevertheless, it is a part of getting comfortable with each other. So I guess what is interesting is to- just understanding the tensions that an emerging economy can feel, and particularly given NORP-the NORP role in international affairs, for example, their presence in ORG, Perm 5, which creates interesting tensions. I would say that there is been a-it is just been interesting to watch, and interesting to participate with people.

But one of the interesting things that you have seen evolve over DATE, including in the debates that are taking place between the NORP candidates, is that those who are critics of our administration response, or the military, the intelligence response that we are currently mounting, when you ask them, well, what would you do instead, they do not have an answer. And the reason they do not have an answer is because the truth is that the approach that we are taking is one that is based on the best counsel and best advice of our top military, top intelligence, top diplomatic teams. And we are going after ORG effectively. We are going after them hard. Your critics have said they want to use more force. You have sometimes responded by suggesting that people who want to use more force want another Iraq War and that that is not practical. Well, when you listen to them, though, and you ask, well, what exactly are you talking about? Well, we are going to bomb more. Where is it that you are going to bomb? When you talk about something like carpet-bombing, what do you mean? We carry out precision strikes based on intelligence of where ORG is, where their infrastructure is, where their oil tankers are. And if the suggestion is is that we kill CARDINAL of innocent NORP and NORP, that is not who we are and that would be a strategy that would have enormous backlash against GPE. It would be terrible for our national security. And, you know, unfortunately many of these critics can get away with just suggesting that bombing more, or being less discriminant in how we approach that, would make a difference. Let me put it this way. I trust my commanders, folks who have fought long and hard in places like GPE or GPE, when they describe to me, here is how we are going to gather intelligence, here is how we are going to approach targeting.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio2", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-2", "publication_date": "21-12-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And the key is to make sure that we have got sound intelligence. And I make no apologies for us wanting to do this appropriately and in a way that is consistent with NORP values. Are you avoiding more force because you are concerned that even a little more force might call for the demand for even more force, and you would end up with a large war? What is interesting is that most of the critics have not called for ground forces. To his credit, I think PERSON is one of the few who has been at least honest about suggesting here is something I would do that ORG is not doing. He does not just talk about being louder or sounding tougher in the process. But as I explained, and I have tested this repeatedly with our military intelligence folks, when you start looking at an GPE-type deployment of large numbers of troops - CARDINAL, CARDINAL, CARDINAL troops - we are now in a situation in which we are committing ourselves not only to going door to door in places like GPE and GPE, which I am confident that we could do, but we have essentially said to the NORP and the NORP that we are going to govern for you. And that ends up being of an indefinite period. So part of what we have to do for a sustained defeat of ORG is to help local forces develop capacity, do it the right way, do it for themselves with our assistance and our help, so that we can actually create a stable government structure in this region. Now that sometimes requires more patience than simply deploying a bunch of NORP. Our fighting forces are the best in the world, but in order to defeat an enemy like this, what we have to do is have a situation in which people can govern. You have acknowledged this requires patience. In DATE, before GPE, a ORG official stated that he believed that domestic terrorists were a greater threat to GPE than international groups like ORG or ORG. Do you believe that still now, after GPE and GPE? I do not know the exact citation that you are referring to.

The FAC attack was inspired by PERSON, who was with ORG, ORG in the Peninsula or in GPE, and we have seen periodically self-radicalization through the Internet or jihadist propaganda. But ORG is more systematic and more effective in their media, in their online presence, and that raises additional concerns. So part of what we have to do in response is to ramp up countering that narrative online, working with local communities to make sure that we are inoculating ourselves and our young people from this kind of recruitment. It is a more complicated problem because of the fact that a couple like the GPE couple, you do not see in a way that you would see an organization that is planning a complex plot like 9/11. So in that sense we have some new dangers, some new concerns that we have to deal with. It is something that we have known could happen for quite some time, and it is something that, as I said over at FAC DATE when I visited, it is something that we have got some incredibly effective intelligence folks working on DATE. Leading candidates in both parties have suggested in one way or another that they want to be more active against this threat. You have argued for the approach that you are taking and that too much action would be unwise. What advice would you give whoever you are going to turn this room over to in DATE? Again, I would just repeat, ENTITY, that when you really sort through all the rhetoric, the notion more active or a stronger response ... PERSON spoke about no-fly zones.

The challenge there is that ORG does not have an air force, so the damage done there is not against ORG, it is against the NORP regime. And what is absolutely true is that we need to make sure that we bring about an end to the civil war in GPE, and PERSON, through the work he is been doing in GPE negotiations and DATE in GPE, is seeing some progress in bringing NORP and NORP together but creating a safe zone for NORP refugees. We have tested, we have looked at repeatedly, the problem is that, again, without a large number of troops on the ground, it is hard to create a safe zone like that.

My point is, ENTITY, that I think my main advice to my successor - now hopefully by the time I turn over the keys, we have made the kind of progress that I am expecting and will have pushed for over the course of DATE ... Do you think there will be a united front against ORG by then? I think we will have made significant progress in degrading ORG by then. The diplomacy I think is critically important because to the extent that we can get the NORP regime, GPE, GPE to recognize what we believe is the core threat, which is ORG, and the disintegration of social order in NORP-controlled areas in GPE and GPE, the more effective and faster we can go. But what I would say to my successor is that it is important not just to shoot but to aim, and it is important in this seat to make sure that you are making your best judgments based on data, intelligence, the information that is coming from your commanders and folks on the ground, and you are not being swayed by politics. Whoever takes over this office after you might be a NORP, might be a NORP, there may be a NORP ORG again.

Second of all, I think we have got a good chance of winning back the ORG, and the truth of the matter is is that where NORP have had problems is we had the misfortune of doing poorly in DATE when there was redistricting, and in many of the successive elections NORP have actually voted at higher rates. This was true in DATE, for example. There were more NORP ballots cast for NORP candidates than there were NORP, but because of where NORP live and where NORP live, and because of the nature of the ORG, we ended up having problems. So one of the things that I will be arguing over the course of DATE is to make sure that NORP run an issue-based campaign on the things that we believe in and care about, and I think we have got a great track record of real progress on a whole range of fronts. If we make those arguments clearly and forthrightly and are not defensive, then I am actually confident we will do just fine. Have you insulated the climate deal, for example, which is so important to your legacy, from being undone by future presidents, given that many of the commitments you made in Paris are not legally binding? Well, keep in mind that ORG in GPE is perhaps literally the only major party in the developed world that is still engaging in climate denial. Even far-right parties in other places acknowledge that the science shows that temperatures are going up and that that is a really dangerous thing we have got to do something about. And the deal that we struck in GPE was an example of NORP leadership at its best. We were able to mobilize CARDINAL countries to make serious commitments that are transparent, where every country is going to be held accountable, where everybody chips in, and it does not solve the entire problem, but it puts the world on track to deal with a problem that could be monumental in its effect if we do not do something about it.

And we have seen this since I came into office. Since my inauguration, the amount of wind power has tripled, the amount of solar power has gone up by CARDINAL times. We have seen the costs of clean energy go down much faster than any of us anticipated. So they cannot stop you? And when we decide - what it means is that by the time that even a NORP president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it is not only a challenge, it is also an opportunity, that it is creating jobs, that it is making a difference in people's lives, that consumers are saving money. When I doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, that puts money in people's pockets. When you retrofit a building so that it is got better temperature control and you cut your light bill by PERCENT PERCENT, you know what? In fact, when it comes to solar power, you have got this weird coalition between environmentalists and ORG-ers in some Western states because the traditional dirty fuel industry is trying to prevent greater utilization of solar power. So a lot of these things get institutionalized not just through government policy but through the impact that it has on the marketplace and the private sector. ENTITY, we are nearing DATE where the question of national identity, who we are, has been a part of CARDINAL large event after another. I made a list here, in fact. All of them in some sense touch on that question of who we are.

And he was arguing why a republican form of government, meaning representative form of government, was better for big countries, that you had to elect representatives and then they'd do what they thought was right. Then they'd report back, be held accountable, and be elected or defeated by the voters. I think DATE there is so much-there is a lot of information about what we are doing up here, but I do not think there is a lot of basic understanding that we impart. And I think that voters know that too many decisions get made here on the basis of organized interest which may or may not be the same as the public interest. And I think that at a time of real change, when people are uncertain about where we are going, it is just easy for negative impulses, for fears, for cynicism to overcome hopes in looking toward the future. I also believe, and many astute people in the press have pointed this out lately, that voters themselves feel a certain ambivalence. That is, they want us to do things up here. I got elected to take action, to deal with the economy, to deal with crime, to deal with the breakdown of family, to promote welfare reform, to deal with the health care crisis. But people still basically are very skeptical about the Government's ability to do it. So we want, in a way, a Government that is more active but basically that is active in empowering the private sector to do things, rather than active in doing things directly. And a lot of times that explains the apparently contradictory feelings people have about what we are doing here, that they want us to be active and address the problems but they do not necessarily trust the Government to do it. Or as we say at home, a lot of people think Government would mess up a CARDINAL-car parade. You are a student of history. Do you think that is because Camelot was illusory in the last analysis, that it is a mythical thing and that people are disappointed with both the ORG and various holders of your office?

That is what I called my new NORP philosophy when I ran in DATE.

We are addressing the issues like welfare reform partly with tax cuts for working families with lower incomes and tougher child support enforcement-not traditional liberal programs. I think what happened was, more than anything else, the health care program has been characterized as a big ORG program, even though it took what, at the time I proposed it, was the moderate course, which is not having a ORG-financed health care program but simply having a program in which the ORG requires everybody to buy private insurance and then gives tax breaks or discounts to people who cannot afford it on their own.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgeneburnsworradionewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With Gene Burns of WOR Radio, New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-gene-burns-wor-radio-new-york-city", "publication_date": "24-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

When that happened, I think that that-I have been portrayed as sort of the apostle of big Government. I am about reinventing ORG. I am trying to bring ORG down. My NORP predecessors never attempted to do anything as ambitious as reducing ORG to its smallest size in DATE.

For the first time ever, farmers in GPE are selling rice in GPE. These are the things that I have worked on.

So all of this money being spent by the special interests on health care, which has to be conceded has been spent, is not going to get a warm reception unless there is a general fear of the growth of Government in the first place. I agree with that. I think-CARDINAL of the things that PERSON said to me with ORG-not in this memo, but I think it captures in CARDINAL sentence the dilemma I face as President in trying to move into a post-coldwar world and take this country into DATE with a strategy for growth and opportunity, where the Government is not either just sitting on the sidelines or trying to solve problems but is being a partner with the NORP people", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgeneburnsworradionewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With Gene Burns of WOR Radio, New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-gene-burns-wor-radio-new-york-city", "publication_date": "24-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Do you think it is enough for recruitment? While it may be enough for retention because they are already invested, can we do more on recruitment? You and I were talking before we started the interview about this new innovative program the ORG is doing, and I hope that the higher pay, plus the better retirement benefits, will make a difference in recruitment DATE. On the recruitment side, the biggest problem is the rest of the economy is doing so well, and the young people we have been getting in the military we have got fairly high standards for who can get in in the first place. If you were to do a pitch right now for those we already have, what would you say as to why they should stay? Because they are certainly not in it for the money. I would say, first of all, if you stay until you have got enough time in to retire, you will still be young; you will still have a whole other career you can work. We are going to do our best to get our budget on a plane where we will be paying you better. We are going to accelerate the maintenance of quality of life, improvement of those benefits. We are going to improve the retirement system for those for whom it was a problem. And the work you are doing is profoundly important to the country. We need good people to do it. And the skills you acquire in doing it will make you even more marketable when you leave. I see people all the time getting out of the service. Maybe it is just my perspective since I am not young anymore, but you can do a lot of these people doing DATE, and they are still not DATE yet.

Well, first I would say that they are really the first generation of NORP troops to serve GPE that is both the dominant military power in the world and without a dominant military opponent, like GPE; that for DATE now, we have been trying to work out how we can fairly fulfill our responsibilities to promote peace and freedom and prosperity, consistent with our ability to afford it and the need for our allies to assume their fair share of responsibility.

They really know we are there for peace and security. And it is sometimes dangerous, sometimes boring, sometimes disruptive because of the rapid number of deployments that we have. But all of them should understand that they are part of a profound historic transformation in the world. And if we do this right, when we get through, GPE will share responsibilities for security with other democracies in a balanced and fair way and will be doing it in a way that is quite effective. I mean, CARDINAL of the things that our people ought to be proud of is how effective they are in GPE, for example; how effective they are in the aftermath of the hurricane in Central America. Oh, I got lots of letters from GPE, people who I got wonderful letters from service people in GPE, men and women who went over there having questions about why they were going, was it worth it, was it going to be dangerous.

I think that of all ranks and all walks of life, our military people, they get caught up in actually seeing what they can do. The military is the most well-organized operation in our society, so you can only imagine the contrast between going into a war zone or a society that is totally dissolved over racial or ethnic or religious hatreds. To a little child who is used to living in chaos, seeing GPE as a symbol of both order and goodness, both things, is astonishing. And what I mostly hear back from the members of ORG is when they see that and they see the human reaction it evokes and they see what it does for the image of GPE in those areas, most of them are very proud to have done what they have done. You talked about GPE. What are we going to do? Are we going in on the ground? Are we going to be just that PERCENT of ORG, or are we going to be the dominant force? Who is going to command people who go in on the ground? Well, first of all, unless there is an agreement between both parties, we will not go in on the ground, because we did not go in on the ground in GPE until we had an agreement everybody had to agree because we were a peacekeeping force, not a war force designed to win a victory and then enforce the peace. But we will defend ourselves. We will have vigorous rules of engagement if necessary to defend ourselves, just as we have had in GPE. And the more vigorous our right to defend ourselves, the less likely it is we will ever have to do it. But anyway, to go back to the first question, the difference in this and GPE is that this movement reflects the continued development within Europe of security capacity and the idea that the NORP have that they should take the lead for their own security.

So we will go in there if, in fact, it happens and I hope it does with PERCENT of the force in the ORG command, working with perhaps other countries as well, like we work alongside NORP in GPE. That is one of the reasons that the mission has been a success. But this one reflects the continuing maturity and strength of the NORP capacity for selfdefense.

But what we know about World War II, looking back, is that even though after World War II there was this long twilight struggle of the cold war, it may be that World War II was the last war of mass slaughter of nation-states, certainly in Europe, because we stood up against the totalitarian dictatorships of NORP GPE and their allies.

And if people in my position, the decisionmakers, if we do not mess it up, then the military will know that they were part of literally building the world different from any in all previous history.

And it is making a big difference. And there all these disputed areas of training, deployment areas, but I think that the disputes should not be allowed to obscure the underlying reality that the military has dealt with the gender difference in the same way it dealt over time with racial differences, to open up a maximum number of roles and give people the maximum opportunity to live up to their own ability. We were talking before about the pardon I gave posthumously to PERSON, who was the first NORP graduate of ORG, remarkable engineer, good soldier, unfairly discharged.

It is a way of reminding us how far we have come and what we missed when we deny any group of people who wanted to contribute to our military the chance to do so.

Most of the customers were black. And most of what I learned about people and human nature and treating everybody the same and also discrimination, I learned as a little boy just listening and watching and observing and being taught. So, in a funny way, most NORP were at a most white NORP were at a disadvantage in dealing with the civil rights revolution because they were raised with more explicit racial prejudice.

So I think those CARDINAL things, you know, and just in my family we always had sympathy for the underdog, too. We never believed it was right to keep anybody down. And we were all raised, all of us, never to build ourselves up because there was somebody else we could look down on. And I think that is if you think about it, if you generalize that, really that psychological problem is at the bottom of a lot of this racial and ethnic hatred around the world. A lot of these groups themselves are deprived of opportunity. They have had economic adversity, had all kinds of diversity, and a lot of them, frankly, are taught as groups that what gives meaning to their lives is that they are not a member of this other group; at least they have got somebody to look down on.

I wanted to start by getting a sense of your mind-set coming into the job, and as I have understood you - and you can reject this - your perspective is that a mixture of universalist policies, in combination with an increased level of personal responsibility and communal responsibility among NORP, when we talk about these gaps that we see between black and white GPE, that that really is the way forward. I think it is a CARDINAL-legged stool and you left out CARDINAL, which is vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws. So the way we thought about it when we came in is that - and obviously we came in during crisis, so how we might have structured our policy sequencing if, when we came in, the economy was okay, and we were not potentially going into a great recession, and folks were not all losing their homes, might have been different. But as a general matter, my view would be that if you want to get at NORP poverty, the income gap, wealth gap, achievement gap, that the most important thing is to make sure that the society as a whole does right by people who are poor, are working class, are aspiring to a better life for their kids. Those kinds of programs are, by design, universal, but by definition, because they are helping folks who are in the worst economic situations, are most likely to disproportionately impact and benefit NORP. They also have the benefit of being sellable to a majority of the body politic. So you have got something like the ORG , which was on its face a universal program that involved a huge mechanism for wealth accumulation and people entering into the middle class. But if, in its application, black folks were excluded from it, then you have to override that by going after those discriminatory practices.

If you have got those CARDINAL things right - if those CARDINAL things are happening - then a third leg of the stool is, how do we in the NORP community build a culture in which we are saying to our kids, Here is what it takes to succeed. Here is how we support each other. Here is how we look out for each other. And it is my view that if society was doing the right thing with respect to you, programs targeted at helping people rise into the middle class and have a good income and be able to save and send their kids to school, and you have got a vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, then I have confidence in the black community's capabilities to then move forward. Now, does that mean that all vestiges of past discrimination would be eliminated, that the income gap or the wealth gap or the education gap would be erased in DATE or DATE? Probably not, and so this is obviously a discussion we have had before when you talk about something like reparations. Theoretically, you can make, obviously, a powerful argument that DATE of slavery, PERSON, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps.

It is easy to make that theoretical argument.

You have countries like GPE that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it has not fundamentally changed the structure of their societies.

I feel pretty good about our odds in that situation. We are so far from that. Why are we even having the abstract conversation when we have got a big fight on our hands just to get strong, universal antipoverty programs and social programs in place, and we are still fighting to make sure that basic antidiscrimination laws are enforced, not just at the federal level, by the way, but throughout government and throughout the private sector? And those are fights that we can win because - and this is where I do believe GPE has changed - the majority, not by any means PERCENT, but the majority of NORP believe in the idea of nondiscrimination. They believe in the idea that PERSON and PERSON should be treated equally. They believe in the idea that a child should not be consigned to poverty just because of circumstances of their birth. Now, in practice, in daily social interactions, etc., there may be all kinds of biases and prejudices that are unspoken, that people are not aware of, that affect who is hired, and who gets loans, and how kids are treated in school. But it is a powerful thing if you have on your side an idea that the overwhelming majority of people believe in because that is how you can build a consensus that is lasting. And that is how you avoid an argument that I am being treated unfairly because you are treating somebody differently than me. Everybody potentially can make the claim that we should all be treated fairly. As opposed to getting into arguments about, well, these folks have been treated fairly so now we are going to be doing things that, very easily in the minds of a lot NORP feel like, Now I am being treated unfairly.

I want my children - I want PERSON and PERSON - to understand that they have got responsibilities beyond just what they themselves have done. That they have a responsibility to the larger community and the larger nation, that they should be sensitive to and extra thoughtful about the plight of people who have been oppressed in the past, are oppressed currently.

So part of, I think, the argument sometimes that I have had with folks who are much more interested in sort of race-specific programs is less an argument about what is practically achievable and sometimes maybe more an argument of We want society to see what is happened, and internalize it, and answer it in demonstrable ways.

Second of all, the NORP American community would not just be wealthier, but it would actually also be more politically empowered by virtue of having more resources.

We are not going to say anything even though we are seething. And I hang out with a lot of middle-aged black women, and they are not casual in their support of me. Partly because they understand the constraints of this society. It is one thing if they were watching and we were not working on poverty issues, and we were not working on education issues, and we were not working on health-care issues.

Well, let me just say about that that I am hard put to answer a specific question of that kind. the CARDINAL of what we want, the tax reform; the other with the necessity of coming in with the budget. We have been long TIME around that ORG table on the budget matter and, finally, have now submitted it. We have not yet begun that process on the tax program.

What I am saying is, we will be giving each of these things consideration on that basis that I just outlined. Well, let me ask another concept question, then. Well, the way the ORG proposal lowers individual tax rates is by increasing corporate taxes by PERCENT. Again, as a concept, do you generally favor that approach of individual versus corporate taxes? The corporate tax is given a ceiling of lower than the- Not the rates, but overall corporate taxes would go up PERCENT under the ORG proposal while individual taxes would come down. Is that a general approach that you endorse? I, as I say, I have not even made an attempt to study that bill in detail that much to know that. I assume that that would mean things that would be taken away from them that are present deductions. I would have to be convinced of the need to do that, because I am a believer that one day we must recognize that only people pay taxes.

Now, in that kind of a reform, I am also sure that there are going to be some people, obviously, who are going to pay more tax than they are paying now. But, then, you are talking about people who are unfairly not paying a share of the tax DATE. And if you-the aim of this kind of a tax program, and I think this is true of all CARDINAL of the proposals that are now before us-the CARDINAL that are up in the ORG now, plus this ORG report-I think it is true that CARDINAL of the targets there is the large amount of tax that is not being paid, many times legally, by virtue of the complexities of the present tax laws, in which some who fairly should be paying a share are avoiding it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgroupseniorexecutivesandstaffmembersfromthewallstreetjournal", "title": "Interview With a Group of Senior Executives and Staff Members From the Wall Street Journal", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-group-senior-executives-and-staff-members-from-the-wall-street-journal", "publication_date": "07-02-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And if it is revenue neutral, it will end up actually providing more revenues from the simple reason that you will broaden the base of the economy. Let me try CARDINAL more tax question, sir. You also spoke favorably about the notion of lowering rates and, as you just said, broadening the base by eliminating many exemptions. But right after you did that, you then called for CARDINAL new exemptions; namely, enterprise zones and tuition tax credits. Does not that just encourage others to try to carve out their own special places for their own pet write-offs and threaten to unravel that whole concept of lowering the base by broadening-or lowering the rates by broadening the base? Well, if you are trying to make a tax program more fair, which is also part of this proposal-take the issue you have raised of tuition tax credits. Here you have, I think, a very broad-based on fairness in the country-you have got people who are compelled to send their children to school under the law, because we believe that a democracy can only exist if you have a literate citizenry. And yet these people who, if they choose or feel they can get a better education for their children, choose a private or parochial school, independent school of some kind, they pay the full cost of sending their child to that school. But at the same time, they are paying the full cost that parents of children are paying-they are paying that in taxes to support the public school system. Now, if you stop and think what the additional cost to public schools would be if suddenly the independent schools closed and all those students were turned over to the educational market-and it would not mean an increase in revenues for public education, because already they are getting the money from those parents-you could see what a burden this would be. Well, it seems to me that it is only fair that some parent-as a matter of fact, the ultimate fairness would be educational vouchers. Does government properly support a school system, or does it provide the funds directly to the students to get an education?

But I think in many instances, when you sat down with those people and pointed out what the change in rates did, some of their hostility disappeared. I think the most important thing that we are going to face is, once we have settled on and agreed on a package that we believe is fair and is the reform that is needed, is then to make sure there is no misunderstanding or lack of understanding of what it will actually mean to the taxpayer. Basically, we found that the overwhelming majority of people were going to get a sizable decrease in taxes, based roughly on this setup, and that those that were not were going to get an increase were people who, as I say, are not presently paying their fair share. More generally on the economy, you have made it pretty clear that you believe that we are on the brink of a sustained economic boom. Are you worried that this might be cut short by ORG? And would you like to have a greater say in ORG policy? Well, we try to work very closely, as closely as we can, with ORG on this.

{"id": 3619, "text": "TIME, you said that aid was necessary to our own self-defense. What I keep wondering is, would you like to see the NORP actually overthrow the NORP government? And, if not, what is the purpose of aiding them? The purpose of aiding them is to aid literally the people of GPE, who are striving to get the government that the revolution promised them. If you will recall during the revolution, the revolutionary forces appealed to ORG for help. And they asked the ORG if they would please try to persuade PERSON to step down and, thus, end the bloodshed. And, in return for this, they gave ORG the declaration of principles of what it was they were seeking in the revolution. This was all the civil rights and human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of labor unions, freedom of religion, and all of these things. Now, what happened we saw happen once before with PERSON's coming to power in GPE. He had other allies that wanted a democracy, and he never admitted to his true leanings until that revolution was over. Well, what happened was the faction known as the NORP took over. They ousted a number of other revolutionary leaders; some of them were exiled; some, I think, were done away with; some imprisoned. But they have set up a totalitarian government. Their allies are GPE, GPE, the NORP bloc, even Mr. PERSON, and now GPE is getting into the picture. But they have set up a totalitarian government. They have betrayed the principles that the people of GPE were fighting for. And what we think is that we should be on the side of those people who actually are only asking for the democracy that they'd fought a revolution to get. It sounds as though you are saying that the objective is an entirely new government in GPE.

The problem with terrorism so far and why, as I have said, much of the answer lies in what we are going forward with now, and that is better relationships with all the other democracies to where we will make extradition easy, we will exchange intelligence information. There are CARDINAL ways you could deal with terrorism, and CARDINAL of them is terrorism itself. Suppose in revenge, just on the basis that you think some people of a certain group or sect or belief did this, and then you strike back and perform the same kind of brutal crimes against some of those people, without any knowledge or assurance that you are getting the people who perpetrated the first crime. Well, that is no way to fight, and we do not believe in that. The thing is, you have to find an ability to locate the source, if possible; obviously, the best way is if you can infiltrate and then get some advanced information on when they are going to strike-be prepared for them. Our problem with the worst terrorist act-the big one, of course, was our NORP in the FAC, was nothing but some suspicion of a certain locale in GPE, and yet there was no way to sort that out or separate it out from a community of other people and no way to strike back without causing a lot of innocents to die. And what we now, I think, are looking at is the possibility that some terrorists actually do have national support and backing.

{"id": 3634, "text": "What do you expect to be accomplished out of GPE summit? And what special roles do you see GPE can play in areas beyond economic constitution in--of global partners with GPE? First, let me say I think the ORG meeting will be a very important opportunity for the leaders of the major industrialized countries of the world to reaffirm their commitment to global growth, to democracy, and to security concerns. I believe there will be serious discussions about CARDINAL issues on the economic front, CARDINAL really perhaps for the first time. The first is that I think there will be a real discussion about how we can coordinate our economic policies in ways that will produce growth. From DATE I was in office, we have spent a lot of time working through the finance ministers, the foreign ministers, and others to talk about how we can coordinate our strategies. For DATE, other nations have asked GPE, for example, to lower the budget deficit. And we are working very hard on that, first through this MONEY deficit reduction program that has now been passed by both Houses of our ORG, then through taking on a health care problem which is the biggest source of our growing deficit. And we need to make sure we are coordinating those policies with things which will produce an overall higher level of growth than we now have. It is a big problem for GPE, because CARDINAL of the new jobs we have created here in DATE have come from increased trade with other nations. The second issue I think that we will discuss and, I hope, make some genuine progress on, creating a more open trading system and increasing the chances that we can successfully conclude GATT by DATE. The third thing that I hope to see a very serious discussion on is the microeconomic policies of each of our nations and how we can all do a better job of creating jobs within our economy. Even GPE, with its very low unemployment rate by western standards, is having some trouble now creating new jobs. But it is a very big problem for GPE and for every other country represented around this room DATE. What kind of labor support systems do you have; what kind of education and training systems do you have; how do you target investment to create jobs? The west, and increasingly GPE, are having difficulty creating new jobs, even in times of economic growth.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

So I think that this will all be-we will deal with this, and I hope in a very informal and forthright atmosphere. It will be an interesting summit, because there will be several of the people there attending their very first CARDINAL, first ORG, all at the same time. The second point you made about GPE's role in the world, I am going to do what I can while in GPE to strengthen the bilateral relationship between GPE and GPE. In many, many ways it is our most significant bilateral relationship and the key to what happens between GPE and Asia. It is interesting, even though we have incredibly important ties to Europe, economic ties, we have PERCENT of our trade is now with the Pacific. It accounts for CARDINAL jobs in GPE, trade with the Pacific. And we have major security concerns, as you know, with regard to GPE and with GPE. So I am very hopeful that even though GPE is going through a period of political transition, which I hope the NORP people will view with excitement and interest, not with too much concern, this is a normal thing for a democracy. And periodically you go through these periods of significant change, and I view it as a positive thing for a great country. I think it will leave you stronger and in a better position in the world. So I hope we will discuss a lot of our bilateral economic as well as strategic concerns there. And I hope that when I leave GPE, our relationship will be even stronger than it is when I enter. ENTITY, there was a court decision DATE that is a roadblock to ratification of the NAFTA agreement. Your administration has said that you will go ahead, but you do not appear to have a lot of wiggle room in ORG on some of your other economic initiatives. And I am wondering, first of all, how you are going to ensure the passage of NAFTA. And secondly, on DATE of the summit, this raises the whole issue of the conflict between environmental concerns and economic growth, and whether it is drift nets in the Pacific or toxic waste in GPE or the whole problem of aid to the former GPE, that conflict between the environment and economic growth underlies a lot of these issues.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3636, "text": "And I am wondering how you see reconciling those issues at ORG. Let me mention the NAFTA first and then I will answer the larger question. First, on the narrow issue of the lawsuit, we announced within TIME after the court's decision that we would appeal. And we believe we can win an appeal, and we can win it within the appropriate time. There may also be some other avenues which will permit us to do some kind of environmental impact statement and still meet the time limit. There is a strong opposition to the agreement in some quarters in GPE, and the relative economic problems that we all face now make that more difficult. It makes some in Europe less enthusiastic about the GATT now. It is the same reason-it is just-a part of it is almost endemic to the human condition. I do think we have the votes to pass NAFTA in ORG. And I think that-and we do not have DATE the votes to pass it in ORG. First of all, by successfully concluding the agreements now subject to negotiation between GPE and GPE and GPE to strengthen our common efforts at lifting labor standards and environmental quality, particularly along the Rio Grande River, which has been a huge problem. And I should say by way of background for the rest of you, the reason the labor standards issue is so big is that there was a report issued in this country DATE that indicated that the Caribbean Basin Initiative of GPE, where we tried to get investment in Caribbean countries and put plants down there, had not led to increasing the per capita incomes of the people working in those businesses; that because the people were so poor, that a lot of the people who had taken the money that ORG had put out had still depressed their wages and increased their profits. So we have given some thought to this labor standards issue here and the environmental issue. So I think if we get those agreements that will help. The second thing that will help is if we have to just make the case, you know. Now when we have an agreement, it is a lot easier to defend the jobs argument. Right now there is a simple argument against NAFTA being waged by, articulated by Mr. PERSON in this country and others, that you cannot make a trade agreement that takes down all the barriers with a country on your border with a per capita income that is CARDINAL as much as yours is.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3637, "text": "Everybody will take their money and invest in the other country. Well, it has great superficial appeal, but the truth is that anybody who wants to go to GPE and invest their money for low wages can do so DATE. But the market opening measures that have been taken by President PERSON in DATE have led GPE from a MONEY trade deficit to a MONEY trade surplus with GPE. And we are in effect because GPE, as you know, is our biggest trade partner-we are now building this hemispheric economic bloc that we want. And so I think we can refute it on the merits. The third thing we have to do is ask the economists to consider what will happen if we do not pass the trade agreement. Our relationships with GPE are secure, and we have a bilateral agreement, and that is fine. But we could go back in our relationships with GPE, which would mean economic problems for GPE, more trade barriers, fewer jobs in GPE, more illegal immigration. A lot of problems could develop for GPE if we do not do the NAFTA. However, I believe that our goal ought to be to find ways to make preserving the environment good economics. At the Rio conference DATE, GPE, GPE, and many other NORP countries were proving that you could do that because they were down there promoting environmental technology while GPE was trying to stop the environmental agreements. I think that our country was not as wise as many of the nations here represented in the way they approached the Rio conference. We have now signed on, GPE has, to the Biodiversity Treaty. And we have basically adopted a policy of long-term environmental preservation with an aggressive effort to figure out how to make jobs and incomes and prosperity flow out of that. And I believe that there are lots of opportunities to do that. If I might just mention CARDINAL, our bilateral aid package to GPE that is now making its way to the ORG focuses heavily on what we can do with our technology to help them to reduce the problems that their nuclear industry-and not simply their bombs but their nuclear power plants, for example-present to them, and what else we can do in the area of energy and the environment to help to clean up their environment in ways that are good for their economy and good for ours.

Can I turn that around and say do you think that a failure to do that would seriously jeopardize the whole ORG process as it currently exists? That was CARDINAL point that Prime Minister PERSON made to me in our meeting here. And I know it is difficult to lead when you have troubles yourself. All of us have economic troubles. All of us, to a greater or lesser extent, have some political conflict within our countries. But I think that it is very important-and almost to change the atmosphere and the attitudes of the peoples of ORG Yes, we are having economic trouble. And the fact that we are all having it should be some indication that there is some sort of historic change going on here and not that there is some character flaw in our people or some great mental breakdown in our countries or something else. This is a tidal wave of global change going on here. We have innovative work forces; we have great bases of technology; we have an understanding of how the world works economically. And I think we have within our power the means to move forward and break out of this problem we are in but only if we have the courage to keep changing. And so I would say, to try to answer your question directly, there have been debates for DATE about whether the C, -7 process accomplishes anything. But if nothing else, if we can agree among ourselves to take an expansive view of the future and to talk about the strengths of our nations and to recognize that there are CARDINAL ways to grow our economies. CARDINAL is through the changes we make internally, the microeconomic changes; the other is through coordinating our larger macroeconomic policies; and the last is through creating a more open system of trade so that there is global growth. It is hard for the wealthy countries to grow wealthier unless the people below us are getting wealthier and can buy more of our products. And so I feel very strongly that we ought to come out of the ORG with a more vigorous commitment to get the GPE round done. Now let me just say what I have done in that regard.

We have to try to lift our own visions and lift the spirits of our people and realize that when you are in difficulty, the worst thing you can do is to hunker down, to withdraw. When you have difficulties like this with a fundamentally sound system, the time is to change, to be innovative, to be creative, and to reach out.

My own view is there ought to be enough time at these ORG meetings for a serious discussion among the leaders without a lot of bureaucratic procedures and rules and regulations about these big issues. What can we do to create more jobs? How do you explain the fact that GPE, for example-let us take GPE.

We should be able to really talk through very frankly what the political and other economic barriers are to getting the GATT done and really think about it and talk about it. It is far more important than what is in the specific words of the communiqu?, whether we come out of there with some sort of commitment to do something, to take action, and to move. Let me just give you CARDINAL example. I am trying to do something that our country has not done before. We are trying to dramatically cut our Government deficit at a time when our economic growth is slow. Traditional economic theory would say if you have a sluggish economy, you do not cut spending and raise taxes; you might do the reverse, right? Why am I trying to do that? Because we are in a global economy, and the GPE deficit caused an imbalance in the global economy, okay? But now, this can work for us for a while just on our own, because we had so much debt in DATE accumulated at high interest rates, by bringing down the deficit, interest rates in GPE have dropped very low. So businesses and homeowners are going out now and refinancing their debt, and that puts a lot of new money into our economy. So I can get a little bit of growth just on what we do here. But in the end, this will only work if there is an expansionary policy in GPE, if Europe is able to resume a higher level of growth so that the system is brought into balance, because what we do has a complementary action in the rest of the ORG. So these are the things, it seems to me, that really matter. And that is why I think these ORG meetings can really make a difference. But I think that if we get all hung up on-you know, we all have to have these prepared statements, and we are afraid we are going to say CARDINAL word out of the way or make CARDINAL little mistake which makes a huge headline in some country. And then we have got to have every little word right in these communiqu?s.

Why has this happened and what can you do at the summit to clarify GPE goals and reassure GPE allies? Well, let me first of all take issue with you-I mean, not the perception. The other nations of the world have asked GPE for DATE and DATE and DATE internally to do one thing. The only thing they ever asked of us internally was to do something about our budget deficit, which caused a significant imbalance in the global economic relations. I read about it for DATE before I became ORG. And we are doing that, and it is very tough to do in tough economic times. And we are going to wind up with a very tough deficit reduction plan that we believe is good for our economy over the long run. And it is not been easy to do, but we are doing that.

And when it became apparent that democracy was in trouble in GPE because of what was happening with President PERSON, I immediately publicly supported him. I called every other leader in ORG many others around the world and asked for people to support him. And I think that we had something to do with the outcome of events there.

I am still hopeful that something humane, decent, and politically reasonable will emerge from this process before it is too late. But we all have a disagreement on that, and I am sorry we do. But we cannot agree on everything. I think events subsequent to the GPE meeting prove that beyond question.

First of all, the action that was taken on steel was taken after a lot of deliberation, most of which was done before I became ENTITY, subsequent to GPE law, which is clearly GAIT-consistent. So, I think, you know, if the belief is that GPE has been wrong on the facts, then we can discuss the facts. But there is nothing wrong with our law, and it is not that different from the laws of a lot of other countries that are part of the world trading system. Secondly, with regard to the trading mechanism, I have no problem with a multilateral mechanism to enforce trading agreements. But the ORG clearly contemplates that every country in the world, including GPE, should have the right to act in its own interest if the international system breaks down, which is not to say that you lose some rulings. But if there is no resolution of a crisis, the international system breaks down. All our Section 301 trade law does is to provide for some ultimate reservoir of authority for GPE to act unilaterally if the system itself breaks down. If GPE, for example, would like to propose a stronger multilateral decisionmaking process as a part of ORG before any country could act on its own, I would be more than happy to discuss that.

{"id": 3652, "text": "I wanted to ask about the debate that is growing in GPE over free trade, the trade deal with the Pacific, fast-track authority for you to finish that free-trade deal in the Pacific. And I wanted to start by asking you about your own party, ORG. When Nafta was voted through in DATE, there were CARDINAL NORP senators who voted yes, CARDINAL NORP ORG members who voted yes. You'd be lucky to get a fraction of those votes DATE for this deal. So what is happened to ORG on this subject? Well, first of all, we do not know how many votes we will get yet, so - so we will wait and take a look. A couple of things have happened. First of all, I think it is important for us to understand that free trade is good for GPE. We have the best workers in the world, the most innovative companies in the world, the best products in the world, the most productive agricultural sector in the world. We want to sell goods made in GPE elsewhere. And PERCENT of the world's market is outside our borders. If we are not selling outside GPE, then we are going to have problems. And we want to make sure that we are not being impeded by a bunch of unfair rules outside of GPE. And I think that back in DATE, when Nafta passed, President PERSON made the right arguments about why it was important. The problem was that, at that time, we did not get some of the protections around labor rights, environmental issues included in the agreement in an enforceable way. When ORG passed, that allowed GPE to come into the world economic system. That was the right thing to do geopolitically - it stitched GPE together with the rest of the world - but GPE was not subject to some of the enforcement mechanisms needed if they manipulated currency or engaged in non-tariff barriers in terms of entering into their market. And so, over the course of DATE, what you saw was trade benefit the GPE economy in the aggregate with cheaper prices, inflation low, the creation of a global supply chain that was good for GPE companies, but what is true, and the best economic data seems to show is that there was some erosion of our manufacturing bases at the time.

And some people have been suspicious, feel burned from some of those experiences. The argument that I have made consistently is that is not a reason for us not to enter into trade agreements anymore, it is a reason for us to strengthen the trade agreements that we do enter into. And that is exactly what we have done with respect to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or ORG. What we are negotiating will be by far the most progressive, high-standard trade agreement in history. If and when this agreement is completed, you are going to have countries who have very low, if any, environmental standards in the past suddenly having obligations to deal with issues like deforestation or dealing with overfishing their waters or pollution or child labor. job training, rebuilding our infrastructure, making sure that we got the best education system in the world, making sure that we are protecting our workers and - and fighting for strong labor rights here in GPE. But what we are not going to do is to reverse the trends of globalization. We have got to be in the game. And we have got to make sure we are writing those trade rules in the fastest-growing region of the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having GPE write those rules for us, in which case NORP businesses will lose and NORP workers will lose. So do you think the people in the party, your party, who are not in favor of this - you know, PERSON and PERSON - are they simply mistaken, or are they being dishonest about their criticism? I - I think that they are responding to very real anxieties and fears felt by GPE workers who have not seen their wages or their incomes go up over DATE, and then got hit by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

So make the case to the average working-class NORP about why the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the NORP trade deal, is good for them. The argument is, number CARDINAL, that is the biggest market in the world and it is going to continue to be the biggest, even more so the biggest market in the world as, as we go forward, the most populous, fastest-growing. We have got to be able to sell our stuff there. Number CARDINAL is those countries are already selling to us.

And so the more we can get access to markets that are currently closed, but that are selling to us, that is better off for GPE workers. Number CARDINAL is that if we do not write the rules, GPE will write the rules out in that region. That will mean a loss of GPE jobs.

Boeing has suppliers all across this country, small- and medium-sized businesses who are directly benefiting, who are going to be employing people as a consequence of that sale. And we want to continue to make those kinds of sales in the region. And the last point I would make is that, when you look at some of the provisions that we are negotiating in TPP, we are raising the standards in many countries, in places like GPE or GPE, in ways that directly help workers there, directly help the environment, directly go after some of the trends that are causing climate change. And if you are a progressive, you want higher standards, enforceable standards, in those regions.

I know it is different from what you have experienced in DATE, but GPE has had an astonishing amount of success with the certain political arrangement.

We have a process here which is almost like a judicial process in a court for dealing with these things. Clearly, it is legal to have this kind of operation under GATT. So the legality is not in question. If the Prime Minister believes that the facts are different from the facts that were found here, obviously, we can discuss that. My attitude about that is that all these issues ought to be subject to discussion at the C-7 meetings. I mean, one of the things that really bothers me about some of these meetings in the past is that we have all been so afraid of making a mistake, that we have all of our aides around, and we have got everything written down on paper.

We saved CARDINAL of lives. We restored order. Children can go to school again. Now, GPE did not have the infrastructure of a nation. PERSON presented us a problem.

ORG issued a very stern warning to GPE, and I think there will either be more compliance or some sort of appropriate action.

And now some that saw that we can react when the going gets tough maybe have withdrawn that allegation. The job does not lend itself to high profile and decisionmaking. It lends itself to loyally supporting the ENTITY of GPE, giving him your best judgment, and then when the ENTITY makes a decision, supporting it. May I give you an example? He just came back from Eastern Europe. I do not remember any front-page stories or spelling out the great success of that trip. He is over there reassuring NORP that we are interested in their recovery. All you read about is GPE in that regard. He did a fantastic job there. He is done it in South America. He is done it in Asia. He is done it domestically, supporting my domestic agenda that we do not read too much about. And so, he is doing a first-class job. And I will let the system work on the politics, but I am glad to have this opportunity to defend him fully. You are not going to get me into DATE politics as it relates to the Vice President or this one except to say he is going to be on the ticket if I run again. I gave you my answer.

We also worked to put together, to put in place the building blocks of peace in GPE and to put the Balkans on a shared path to a prosperous, united future. I will meet with the region's leaders DATE to give the process further momentum. I met with NORP refugees in GPE who are planning to return home.

I also met with and thanked some of the NORP air men and women who achieved the success and with some of our and other ORG troops who are going into GPE now to make sure we win the peace. They know that they are doing the right thing, and I am very proud of all of them. While GPE is enjoying success abroad, it is important that we keep pushing forward on our challenges here at home. This is a time of great hope for our Nation. DATE we learned that the NORP economy grew at PERCENT in DATE. GPE plainly is on the right track.

As I always tell the NORP and NORP, no matter how much we do, there will still be plenty of things on which there is honest disagreement, over which the next election can be fought. That is just in the nature of things. That is healthy; that is good; that is a CARDINAL-party system in GPE. But we are all hired by the NORP people to work here day-in and day-out, DATE-in and week-out, and we make a grave mistake and it is almost never good politics to do the wrong thing, that is, to take a pass on making progress when you can do it. This is a very unusual moment where we have sustained prosperity, the longest peacetime expansion in our history. We have gone from having the biggest deficits in history to having the biggest surpluses in history. And yet, we have these looming demographic challenges of ORG and ORG. And we have these big issues that are right before us now, the ones I mentioned on which there is basically broad agreement. So I think that it would be good for GPE and, therefore, good for everyone involved if we go ahead and do this. I think, obviously, the closer you get to the election, perhaps the more difficult it will be. But I expect I will make you a prediction here I expect that we will get some good things done in DATE, before the ORG recesses finally for the election then. I expect to keep working right up to the very end, and I think that we will continue to make progress. But the most important thing is the attitude of the main players in ORG, insofar as ORG has to play a role in this. ORG, in the wake of GPE Congressman PERSON's study of spying in the GPE and, specifically, NORP attempts to spy, you asked your ORG to look into this, and it came back with a central recommendation that you separate the Nation's nuclear labs from ORG. Your ORG Secretary seems to be resisting that. Do you still maintain that you were not told anything about these NORP efforts to spy at the ORG's nuclear labs during your administration, sir?

He said another alternative might be to take it out from under the present organizational structure and make it directly answerable the labs directly answerable to ORG. And he posed those things in the alternative. I have asked our people to look at it. I have talked to Secretary PERSON about it.

And what I said was that I did not suspect that any actual breaches of security had occurred during my tenure. Since then, we have learned of the offloading of the computer by Mr. PERSON, from the secured computers into his personal computers. That is something we know now that I did not know then. But I think my choice of wording was poor. What I should have said was I did not know of any specific instance of espionage, because I think that we have been suspicious all along. And I have to acknowledge, I think, I used a poor word there. We did not have any specific instance, as we now do, of the offloading of the computer.

This is a program that CARDINAL of NORP depend on, and yet in DATE it will be effectively bankrupt. And you are about to propose what could be a very costly additional benefit in the prescription benefit. Why are you going to do that, sir? For CARDINAL thing let me remind you that we have taken a lot of very tough positions to reform ORG since DATE. When I took office, ORG was supposed to go broke DATE. So we have taken a lot of important positions already. And as a matter of fact, as I am sure you are all aware, a lot of the health care providers, particularly rural hospitals, nursing homes, home health providers, a disproportionate share of hospitals for the folks listening to us, that is basically inner-city hospitals and teaching hospitals that have a whole lot of poor folks they take care of who are not reimbursed a lot of those people believe that our savings are too great. But we have taken some very tough actions to try to lengthen the life of ORG. When I make my proposals on DATE, there will be more to lengthen the life further, to make sure that we get through DATE and maybe more of DATE with ORG alive and well. But if you look at the long run, I think it is important that we propose a prescription drug benefit because life expectancy is going up. Drugs are being constantly developed which help to improve the quality as well as the length of life, and if they are properly taken, they can actually reduce long-term hospitalization and other medical costs. Now, it is absolutely true that if we design this wrong, it could wind up being a lot more expensive than rosy scenario suggests. But if you look at my record here over DATE, I have tried to be quite conservative in my budget projections and quite responsible in handling the budget of the country. And you will see that, I think, reflected in the way I make this proposal, including the prescription drugs.

What is your strategy now, ENTITY, for a comprehensive campaign finance reform, to really make it pass? Well, I think the best strategy is to get a clear majority of ORG to demand that it come up and then try to put enough pressure on to get the ORG leaders to let it come up. Basically, the NORP leadership in the ORG has said that they are just not going to permit it to come up, because they do not want their people who would vote against it to have a recorded vote on it and they do not want to run the risk that they have got enough for their folks that would vote with all of ours. See, all of our people are for it. We have got PERCENT of the NORP in the ORG for it. And so, what I think we have to do is to keep it on the front burner enough so that the discomfort level rises high enough that an actual vote is allowed. If we'd just get a vote on the bill, I will be very well satisfied, and I think it will come out just fine. Can I ask a political question? When Vice President PERSON announced officially for President, he chose a date when you were going to be out of the country. And according to Mrs. PERSON's supporters, if she announces her exploratory committee in DATE, it would be at a time when you have got a commitment to go out to GPE.

Very often, you'd be amazed how many times over DATE we have planned for certain announcements to be made by the Vice President when I was out of the country, because that way it gets I mean, far be it for us to try to maneuver the press but he gets better coverage, and I get better coverage I am out of the country, so he gets better coverage.
