More managed care; people bargaining tougher for prices; more and more people who are uncovered where there is uncompensated care that has to be provided; less and less ability to pass on the cost of uncompensated care to other people because they are in these managed care networks they are in: all this stuff is going to happen if we do not do anything. All of us could go on vacation for [DATE], and this same thing would go on. You know that. And do not let your Members fall for it. What is going to happen is we will continue to see these trends occur unless we find a way to give health care providers reimbursement for all the people for whom they care, at an appropriate level in an appropriate way.

Sometimes I think if you do work for [ORG] you will never get that, but--we are working together pretty well on the whole. This is a big deal.

Finally, let me say-and this, I guess, is, except for this whole issue of whether this is a [ORG] program, which it is not , is the most controversial part of it-our reform is based on providing guaranteed benefits at work.

I am very proud that we are announcing these scholarships, but I cannot wait for [DATE] when there is not a single person eligible for one. And I think that all of us should think about that. We know from painful experience that the most serious threat to the safety of police officers is a criminal armed with a weapon. Most police officers who lose their lives die from gunshot wounds. That is why we fought hard to keep guns off the streets, out of the hands of criminals. Brady background checks, as I said earlier, have prevented [CARDINAL] felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying guns. [DATE] I announced a new step to close a loophole in the law that makes it easier for gun traffickers and criminals to avoid those checks at private gun shows. Make no mistake, the insidious practice of sidestepping our guns laws is not an idle threat. The city of [GPE] recently concluded an undercover investigation of gun dealing. And as you saw, I hope, in the [TIME] press, it has just filed suit alleging widespread practices by gun dealers in the [GPE] area of selling guns illegally, counseling purchasers on how to evade firearms regulations, even selling guns to purchasers who say they intend to violate the law. We know legitimate gun dealers make every effort to comply with the law, but these charges in [GPE], if proven true, would demonstrate that at least some parts of the gun industry are helping to promote an illegal market in firearms. Such disrespect of our law endangers our people, and we will be watching the progress of this lawsuit closely. The [ORG] already vigorously investigates gun dealers and other gun traffickers who violate [ORG] laws. We will continue to work closely with [ORG] and local police to trace the crime guns back to their source and prevent illegal gun sales, especially to criminals and juveniles. But there is more we can do to protect our communities and police officers. You have heard a little bit of it from Detective [PERSON], but let me just say again, for [DATE] now criminals who have used guns to commit their crimes have been subject to stiff mandatory penalties under [ORG] law and virtually every [ORG] law in the country.

But we stopped it. That is more than any top ranking [NORP] accomplished on any [ORG] committee. Not only that, I have filed America First legislation, I have offered legislation to preserve and protect our second amendment, I have offered bills to impeach [PERSON] [CARDINAL] times, bills to fire Dr. [PERSON], bills to expel insurrectionist [PERSON], bills to eliminate the [ORG], bills to ban vaccine mandates, and bills to secure our Southern border and finish President [PERSON]'s wall. I even released my own congressional oversight report on my visit to the [GPE] jail, which currently houses [DATE] pretrial defendants, still to this day. My report revealed the horrific conditions they face. I called for an end to the abuse of pretrial defendants and for the termination of the person overseeing their care, Deputy Warden [PERSON]. I have hit a few roadblocks on the way, perhaps because the [GPE] elites realize that I would always put you the voters first. Just after I was sworn in [NORP] recognized me as the biggest threat to their [NORP] agenda in [ORG] and made me their [CARDINAL] target. We can remember all those news stories. Well, they kicked me off committees, not just [NORP], but unfortunately [CARDINAL] [NORP], because they knew I was not going to go along with their [GPE] last establishment agenda. They kicked me off because they realize, you know what, I am just like you; I am a proud [NORP] and I am tired of the business as usual in the swamp. Now to tell you the truth, in the current 117th [ORG] committees are useless for [NORP]. [NORP] are in the minority and [PERSON] rules [ORG] with an iron fist. [ORG] bills and amendments are rejected and hardly see the light of day. But that will not last forever. When [NORP] take back the majority in [DATE], it is going to be a different story.", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmarjorietaylorgreenedeliversspeechongopprimarywin52422transcript", "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene delivers speech on GOP primary win 5/24/22 Transcript", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/marjorie-taylor-greene-delivers-speech-on-gop-primary-win-5-24-22-transcript", "publication_date": "25-05-2022", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Marjorie Taylor Greene"], "gender": ["F"]}}

Right? More managed care; people bargaining tougher for prices; more and more people who are uncovered where there is uncompensated care that has to be provided; less and less ability to pass on the cost of uncompensated care to other people because they are in these managed care networks they are in: all this stuff is going to happen if we do not do anything. All of us could go on vacation for [DATE], and this same thing would go on. You know that. And do not let your Members fall for it. What is going to happen is we will continue to see these trends occur unless we find a way to give health care providers reimbursement for all the people for whom they care, at an appropriate level in an appropriate way. [DATE] of research now shows that more and better trained nurses result in shorter hospital stays, better survival rates, fewer complications, whether you are dealing with low birthweight babies or older people. You do not have to work for [ORG] to understand that healthier patients and shorter stays means lower health care costs. Sometimes I think if you do work for [ORG] you will never get that, but--we are working together pretty well on the whole. This is a big deal. This choice issue and maintaining an array of qualified people doing the things for which they are best qualified is terribly important. Finally, let me say-and this, I guess, is, except for this whole issue of whether this is a [ORG] program, which it is not , is the most controversial part of it-our reform is based on providing guaranteed benefits at work. Now the reason for that is simple, for the people in this country that have health insurance, [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] of them have it at work where there is some shared responsibility between the employer and the employee.
