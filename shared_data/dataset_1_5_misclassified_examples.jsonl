Here is the deal, [ORG] is providing critical needs assistance, for example, to help the hotel bill you racked up because you could not stay in your home during the hurricane. [ORG], [ORG], is also offering assistance to families in impacted areas, but right now we are hearing reports that some insurance companies may deny coverage for additional living assistance expenses unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. People pay their insurance premiums and they are supposed to get payments from their insurance companies for relocation costs, but insurance companies in the face of the strongest storm since [DATE] say, No, no, we are not going to pay you what we owe you, because the fact is parishes in [GPE] like [GPE] and [GPE] issued a voluntary event order at first and may not have even had enough time to make a mandatory one as the storm moved in so fast. Other parishes, a voluntary evacuation order suggested that residents could try to protect themselves by sheltering in place against the ferocious winds. We can all understand why folks felt safest leaving their homes and going elsewhere, out of the path of the devastating storm. No one, no one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip, to be able to stay in a hotel, they left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death, there is nothing voluntary about that, so I am calling on the private insurance companies right now at this critical moment, do not hide behind the fine print and technicality. Do your job. Keep your commitments to your communities that you insured. Do the right thing and pay your policy holders what do you owe them to cover the cost of temporary housing in the midst of a natural disaster. Help those in need, that is what all of us need to do.

And I have another thought. This is a great industrial center. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at [GPE] as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is [CARDINAL] reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust.

A little town in [GPE] had something for [DATE] called [DATE] in [DATE].

Also, I hope all of us have long years of service in the future in [GPE]. I have just come back from a very fine visit to [GPE] to see a new steelplant that is exciting for an engineer and a President to observe. This is the most modern steelplant in the world. Each employee produces [QUANTITY] of steel per year, including all the executive management. This is the highest productivity per steelworker in the world. They use [PERCENT] as much energy as the former steelplants used. They make steelrod of the highest quality, and [PERCENT] of it, you might be interested in knowing, is sold at this time to [GPE], successfully competing in price [CARDINAL] the world away with the [NORP] steelplants that are much closer. The dynamism and competence of our own Nation and its free enterprise system, in my judgment, is equaled by the dynamism and confidence and the competence of the public servants like you, who represent the [NORP] people in our Federal Government. I came to the Presidency determined to make my own administration and the Government in general more responsive to the [NORP] public and at the same time more efficient in the delivery of services to those who look to us for leadership and for service. Since taking office, I have seen repeatedly that the key to the more effective Government, which we all desire, has been our creation of a more productive, more dynamic, and more cost-conscious [ORG] workforce. In [DATE], with the help of many of you assembled here, I was able to sign into law a bill which completely overhauled the civil service system of [ORG] for the first time in [DATE]. It was a landmark achievement. It was [PERSON] concept, which the [ORG] courageously passed for my signature. It was one of the most significant achievements of my own administration. The Civil Service Reform Act gives [ORG] managers, like many of you, some of the same management incentives that have proved so effectively to make our private economy and its free enterprise system competitive and the pride of the entire world.

No one, no one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip, to be able to stay in a hotel, they left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death, there is nothing voluntary about that, so I am calling on the private insurance companies right now at this critical moment, do not hide behind the fine print and technicality.

The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. [GPE] has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us, as citizens and as parents, are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed. That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It is family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it is not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline. Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools do not meet this test. That is why instead of just pouring money into a system that is not working, we launched a competition called [ORG]. To all [CARDINAL] [GPE], we said, If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we will show you the money. [ORG] is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in [DATE].

They did not vote to open our borders, to give away safety of our streets, their prosperity, or our freedom, or our future. So I want to say again, coming here to [GPE] [TIME], it is time. It is time for freedom loving [NORP] to stand up and say, No more. It is time for freedom loving [NORP] to unite behind an agenda that will bring [GPE] back. And we do not have to speculate about what that agenda is. For all of my years in this movement, I actually first ran for [ORG] when [CARDINAL] of the namesakes of this dinner was still in [FAC]. I had a chance to meet President [PERSON] in [FAC], my wife and I met him. I will never forget, I sat down next to him. I mean, [PERSON] was the reason why I joined [ORG], maybe like many of you. But I sat down next to him, felt like I was talking to Mount Rushmore. And I said, Mr. President, I, I said, I just want to thank you for everything you have done for this country and to encourage my generation to believe in this country again. And for all of my life, I will believe in that moment, that the 40th President of [GPE] blushed and said, Well, [SPEAKER], that is a very nice thing of you to say. But President [PERSON] articulated an agenda that he never took credit for, because it was an [NORP] agenda.

Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at [GPE] as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house.

The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. [GPE] has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us, as citizens and as parents, are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.

Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at [GPE] as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house.

The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. [GPE] has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us, as citizens and as parents, are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.

We need to teach our kids that it is not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline. Our schools share this responsibility.

And then even after he won, it was [DATE] before he endorsed him, because he did not want to see it happen. I think he is probably the most surprised person on Earth, [PERSON]. And they said, Sir, [PERSON]'s going to start campaigning for him, [DATE]. I said, That is okay. That is good. He campaigned for [PERSON]. How did that work out? And his crowds are extraordinarily small, just so you understand. They are not big. They are like [CARDINAL] people, [CARDINAL] people. For [DATE], [PERSON] and [PERSON] have been inciting violence against police officers and riots, like those carried out by [PERSON] supporters in [GPE]. Look at what is going on in [GPE]. They should call us into [GPE]. We will solve the problem, or let their police handle the problem. Let their police handle the problem.

It is time for freedom loving [NORP] to stand up and say, No more. It is time for freedom loving [NORP] to unite behind an agenda that will bring [GPE] back.

But I sat down next to him, felt like I was talking to Mount Rushmore. And I said, Mr. President, I, I said, I just want to thank you for everything you have done for this country and to encourage my generation to believe in this country again. And for all of my life, I will believe in that moment, that the 40th President of [GPE] blushed and said, Well, [SPEAKER], that is a very nice thing of you to say.

Now, a lot of private companies and public entities are doing their part. [DATE] I am calling on insurance companies not to evade the responsibility, to keep the priorities they made to their customers and the promises they made and help some folks who are hurting. Here is the deal, [ORG] is providing critical needs assistance, for example, to help the hotel bill you racked up because you could not stay in your home during the hurricane. [ORG], [ORG], is also offering assistance to families in impacted areas, but right now we are hearing reports that some insurance companies may deny coverage for additional living assistance expenses unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. People pay their insurance premiums and they are supposed to get payments from their insurance companies for relocation costs, but insurance companies in the face of the strongest storm since [DATE] say, No, no, we are not going to pay you what we owe you, because the fact is parishes in [GPE] like [GPE] and [GPE] issued a voluntary event order at first and may not have even had enough time to make a mandatory one as the storm moved in so fast. Other parishes, a voluntary evacuation order suggested that residents could try to protect themselves by sheltering in place against the ferocious winds. We can all understand why folks felt safest leaving their homes and going elsewhere, out of the path of the devastating storm. No one, no one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip, to be able to stay in a hotel, they left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death, there is nothing voluntary about that, so I am calling on the private insurance companies right now at this critical moment, do not hide behind the fine print and technicality. Do your job. Keep your commitments to your communities that you insured. Do the right thing and pay your policy holders what do you owe them to cover the cost of temporary housing in the midst of a natural disaster. Help those in need, that is what all of us need to do. That is what we are trying to do. I have tasked my Senior Advisor, [PERSON], a [GPE] neighbor and former Congressman from [GPE]'s 2nd District for [DATE] to lead this relief effort.
