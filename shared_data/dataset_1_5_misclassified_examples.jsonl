It means average families can borrow at less cost. That means lower home mortgages, lower credit card payments, lower car payments, lower college loan payments. I am telling you, the average family will save a whole lot more under this plan looking after our future than they will under the tax cut plan offered by the other party. Now, because their plan spends almost all the [ORG] related surplus on a tax cut, it would not only do nothing to restore [ORG]; it would require deep cuts in those things we need to be investing the most in: in education, in hiring those [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] teachers, in medical research, in technology, in preserving the environment, in modernizing our national defense. We will not have the money to do that. And again I say, this is a mistake because our plan has a sizable tax cut, [MONEY] for middle income families to meet their crucial needs for child care, for longterm care, for saving for retirement. It provides tax cuts for building world-class schools, for developing and installing new environmental technologies, for funding the new markets initiative, which I highlighted on my tour to the poorest parts of [GPE] [DATE], simply to say we will give you the same tax breaks to invest in poor areas in [GPE] we give you to invest in poor areas overseas. It is the right thing to do. So here is the choice: We can save [ORG] and [ORG] and make [ORG] better. We can make [GPE] debt-free, giving our children a stronger economy and all of you lower interest rates. We can still have a good-size tax cut, but not as large as the one the [NORP] leaders propose. Again I say, their plan would spend almost the entire [ORG] portion of the surplus on tax cuts. It would not extend the solvency of [ORG] by [DATE]. Depending on how they do it, it might not extend the solvency of [ORG] by [DATE]. It would force drastic cuts in education, research and technology, defense, and the environment.", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunicationsworkersamericaconventionmiamibeachflorida", "title": "Remarks to the Communications Workers of America Convention in Miami Beach, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-communications-workers-america-convention-miami-beach-florida", "publication_date": "13-07-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

But by [DATE], I was pretty obviously pregnant. The principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then - he wished me good luck, and he did not ask me back for [DATE], and hired someone else for the job. I stayed home, and I tried desperately to be a good wife and mother, but I really wanted to do something more. So, I came up with a plan to go back to school, and this time I found a law school that was nearby. I cannot describe to you how crazy the idea was of my going to law school. My mother said many, many times, very loudly, that she thought I was jeopardizing my marriage. My brothers - all [CARDINAL] of them - just thought I was plain nuts. My then husband smiled indulgently, making it clear that he knew that I could not possibly pull this off. But I bowed my head, I pushed on. You might say, nevertheless, I persisted. But I was determined, and so I took all the needed exams, I filled out the application; I budgeted and figured out how I could pay the $[MONEY] tuition. I worked out what the commute in my trusty blue Volkswagen and I had it all figured - all of it - until I hit the [CARDINAL] big boulder that nearly crushed me: child care. My daughter [PERSON] was about to turn [DATE], and if I wanted to go to law school, I needed child care. And I know it sounds like I was not very smart, but I had not really realized exactly how hard that was gonna be. You know, I visited all kinds of places. I went everywhere - and I struck out everywhere. They cost a fortune or they smelled funny or the kids looked miserable. This went on for [DATE], and it is getting to be [DATE], and I am starting to sweat. We were bearing down on the start of school, and I knew that if I could not get childcare worked out, my idea of going back to school was over before it started. Finally, finally, [DATE] before classes were starting, I found a place that seemed nice. Cheerful teachers, a good playground, it smelled good. That thing matters, you know. There was [CARDINAL] problem: they only took children who were dependably potty trained.", "metadata": {"text_id": "warrensenategovnewsroompressreleasessenatorwarrendeliverskeynoteaddressatnwlcandrsquos45thanniversarygala", "title": "Senator Warren Delivers Keynote Address at NWLC\u2019s 45th Anniversary Gala", "source": "https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-delivers-keynote-address-at-nwlc-and-rsquos-45th-anniversary-gala", "publication_date": "19-10-2017", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Elizabeth Warren"], "gender": ["F"]}}

He said, Come in everybody, come in. And they heard that and they all started walking up and I said, You cannot come in. You will be stopped. And we have [CARDINAL] [NORP] soldiers that are there. I said to the president of [GPE], who I like a lot, and he actually likes me. He is from a different persuasion. He is a socialist, but he is a great gentleman. And I said, Mr. President, you are going to have to stop them because we are building the wall and they are coming in. And I worked out a deal. I said, I will not put tariffs on the [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of cars you send over on a [DATE] basis, but you have to put [CARDINAL] 000 soldiers on our border free of charge. And he said, I will do that. Now they are gone. And now they are all gone. And those soldiers knew what they were doing. I will be honest with you, there were no games. There were no games. We did a great job during the construction of the wall. Once the wall was up, you did not need them, but you have to finish the level empty areas of the wall. The flood of illegal immigrants is also placing a crushing burden on communities across the state and throughout the nation, depleting your already overcrowded schools and hospitals and public services of critical resources, you know that. They are so crowded now because there're so many people, many of them cannot speak English. The whole thing is a catastrophe. Your kids are saying, What the hell is going on? Even before the [PERSON] border crisis, [GPE] taxpayers were spending a staggering [MONEY] a year to pay for the welfare education justice system, course and illegal immigration, $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] per [GPE] household every year. And that is now going to be doubled and tripled. In our movement, we believe that your taxpayer dollars should go to support truly needing [NORP]. You have to take care of [NORP] citizens.
