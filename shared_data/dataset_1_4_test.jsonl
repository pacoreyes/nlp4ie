I remind you of the [MONEY] tax reduction already provided to our citizens. You know, this administration goes on the theory that the private citizen knows better how to spend his money than the [ORG]. This program is designed to accomplish a fairer distribution of the tax burden. It will give more liberal tax treatment for dependent children who work, for widows or widowers with dependent children, and for medical expenses. It will help to expand business activity and so create jobs throughout the country and will also give real encouragement to small businesses. I cannot overemphasize the importance I attach to the general policies and proposals comprehended in the tax bill, and the need for its early passage. I am sure you will agree that the [ORG] should enact this tax legislation, already passed by [ORG]. And the point I want to make is this: some of its benefits will begin to accrue to. the people of our country as soon as enacted, because then, with tax uncertainties removed, investors, manufacturers, and businessmen will all accelerate their activities thus creating new jobs and increasing the national income. This is an added reason for speed. Now, another pending measure, vitally necessary to every citizen, is the new farm program. Its purpose is to promote stability and prosperity in agriculture and help assure our farmers a fair share of the national income. The Nation's present farm law encourages production of great surpluses of a few commodities, and theft it prices those commodities out of their traditional markets. As a result, the Government must now spend $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] an hour--[TIME]--just to store these surpluses. That is $[MONEY], [MONEY] a day. In [DATE] the [ORG] increased its investment in price supported commodities by [MONEY]. During [DATE], the present law would force another increase.

If we are truly interested in reducing global poverty, those of us who are granting money need to stand up with a united voice and say, We are not going to tolerate corruption. [CARDINAL] of the things [PERSON] and others are going to do at [ORG], they are going to apply the same principle I have just described to you to all our development aid. We are going to insist upon transparency and performance and accountability. We are going to ensure that every [NORP] aid dollar encourages developing nations to build institutions necessary for long-term success. And we are going to help developing nations achieve economic independence. That is what we are going to do. We are going to get away from this notion about, kind of, just analyzing monies based upon percentage of this, that, or the other. We are going to be generous in our contribution and demand results in return. Now, what is interesting about the goal of eliminating poverty is that [PERCENT] of [NORP] resources to the developing world come from the private sector. It is one thing for me to talk, and now I am changing from what we are doing to encouraging you to continue doing what you are doing. The truth of the matter is, our generous Nation is-the generosity of our [ORG] is reflected in the private sector a lot.

Thanks, we will take the next question. Hi. Let me ask you a little bit more about the idea of a diagnosis. I do not think there is any question, as we have heard expressed from everybody -- from the President to [PERSON] and throughout many of the leaders -- about the problems and how they exist.

And we have been able to significantly degrade [ORG] core in [GPE] and [GPE], decimate its leadership ranks, reducing the threat that they pose. At the same time, we have seen the threat of terrorism evolve as different groups emerged in places like North Africa. And then, with [ORG], you have an organization that is the legacy of the [ORG] and [GPE] organization, which changed to [ORG]. And they represent an acute threat in [GPE] and [GPE] [DATE]. So essentially, we have to step back and make decisions based on threat assessments and where the threat is coming from.

When I was a sports announcer, I loved that, and I believed that that would probably be my career on out and was very happy with it. And then the opportunity came to switch to what originally had been a love of mine-acting and I enjoyed that very much. I was a reluctant entrant into public life. I never believed for [TIME] that I would ever be tempted to want to serve in public office. As I say, I was so happy in what I was doing. And I was really kind of dragged kicking and screaming into seeking the governorship and thought that what I was doing was kind of a very temporary thing, because it was put to me on the basis that, with our party very divided after the [DATE] campaign, at odds that I might be able to help bring the party together, and that I offered a chance for victory in that gubernatorial race. And I have often said that I think when I finally, grudgingly, said yes that I really thought no farther than the election.

I think that the issue is for example, I do not think most [NORP] really think that it would be a great idea to cut out all spending on poor children in order to afford a capital gains tax cut. I do not think that is where they would come down. On the other hand, would they rather have a tax cut or just waste money on any program, including a program that perpetuated dependency? I think they would or reduce the deficit or whatever. So I think the what my goal is, is to say there is a national interest in the health and welfare of our children. I think it requires some investment of taxpayer money in the areas of particularly basic health care and nutrition and immunization of children against serious diseases.

They want to eliminate carbon from the [GPE] energy industry, which means abolishing all [NORP] oil, clean coal, and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this Federally mandated shutdown would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities, and the unfettered offshoring of [CARDINAL] of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. [CARDINAL] of jobs would go. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of countries would be at a level that you have never seen.

From the beginning of this administration, any improvement in relationships between [GPE] and [GPE] has depended upon making progress on the issue of [NORP] who were missing in action or held as prisoners of war. [DATE], I lifted the trade embargo on [GPE] in response to their cooperation and to enhance our efforts to secure the remains of lost [NORP] and to determine the fate of those whose remains have not been found. It has worked. In [DATE], [GPE] has taken important steps to help us resolve many cases. [CARDINAL] families have received the remains of their loved ones and at last have been able to give them a proper burial. [GPE] has delivered to us [CARDINAL] of pages of documents shedding light on what happened to [NORP] in [GPE]. And [GPE] has stepped up its cooperation with [GPE], where many [NORP] were lost.

That is not an excuse. We should have done better. Now, on the merits, let me say, we came to [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] for [CARDINAL] reasons. [CARDINAL] is all the senior people at [ORG] and in the office of drug control believed that there had to be some difference because of the difference in violent crime associated with powder and crack. None of them believe that the [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] was justifiable. They all thought it was totally unconscionable. And they all thought it ought to be reduced dramatically. So they recommended [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. Secondly, prison sentences are longer than ever now. And it was-the conclusion was reached that if they recommended anything lower, what [ORG] would do in reaction would be to try to raise the minimums for everybody and leave everyone worse off. And so I think we need to take a hard look at that [ORG] prison population anyway to see whether there are too many nonviolent offenders in there. And I think this should be viewed for just what it is, a major step forward. Let us see. Hopefully, we will be permitted to implement it, and if we are, we will see if it works. Your challenge to [GPE] to have a conversation about race has certainly spun off a number of conversations, including conversations about slavery and reparations. And I am wondering whether or not, since you have had more time to reflect, you think an apology to [NORP] is warranted. And more specifically, what do you think of at least having a commission to study the feasibility of reparations, regardless of what your opinion is? Well, I do not believe that- what I think I should do now is let this advisory board do its work and see what they have to say about the apology issue and all the related issues. The [CARDINAL] thing I did not want to do is to define the work of this commission, which I hope will be quite broad, as I explained, in terms of any particular issue early on.

Well, [PERSON] and I both spent a lot of time on this, and it is important for [CARDINAL] reasons. [CARDINAL] is, I was in music when I was the age of these children, and I know what it can do. And secondly, I have been very disturbed over [DATE] over [DATE], more and more, as schools have come under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music programs. You know, the principals have a lot of problems. They have a lot of challenges they have to meet, and many times the money is not there. And the school districts have cut a lot of these music programs out all over the country. And when I heard what [ORG] was doing, I did kind of volunteer to get involved. I wrote [PERSON] a letter and said, Look, I am for this, and I think we have got to get music back into these schools. A lot of young children we know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education. Not everyone learns in the same way. Not everyone's brain is stimulated in the same way. And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to have higher academic performance. What do you say, though I mean, let us say, devil's-advocate it for a second I am a member of the local school board, and I sit down, and I look at the budget, and it is shrinking. And I say, I have got choices. I have to make cuts. I have got school lunches over here. I have books for the library here. I have music education over here.

And I think I have to communicate to the [NORP] people clearly what the basic values are that animate my decisions and why I am doing this even though it may be unpopular because I think it will be good for the country over the long run. And that is a real lesson I had to learn, because when you are Governor, being Governor is more about whether you accomplish things and what you actually do in terms of the day-to-[DATE] work. Now, that is very important for a [INTERVIEWED], but very often it is almost impossible for people even to keep up with that until the election starts. So I have learned that.

By the way, you will be participating in many debates in this campaign? We can count on it. Oh, yes, you know, I-you can. I believe the [INTERVIEWED] should be accountable, and I think debates are a good way to do it. So I have always been willing to do that. Basically I would be opposed to those changes.

Even if all our planned intermediate-range missiles have to be deployed in Europe over [DATE]-and we hope this will not be necessary-we will have eliminated [CARDINAL] existing nuclear weapons for each new weapon deployed. But this is not enough. We must accelerate our efforts to reach agreements that will greatly reduce nuclear arsenals, provide greater stability, and build confidence. Our third task is to establish a better working relationship with each other, one marked by greater cooperation and understanding. Cooperation and understanding are built on deeds, not words. Complying with agreements helps; violating them hurts. Respecting the rights of individual citizens bolsters the relationship; denying these rights harms it. Expanding contacts across borders and permitting a free exchange or interchange of information and ideas increase confidence; sealing off one's people from the rest of the world reduces it. Peaceful trade helps, while organized theft of industrial secrets certainly hurts. Cooperation and understanding are especially important to arms control. In [DATE] we have had serious concerns about [NORP] compliance with agreements and treaties. Compliance is important because we seek truly effective arms control. However, there is been mounting evidence that provisions of agreements have been violated and that advantage has been taken of ambiguities in our agreements. In response to a congressional request, a report on this will be submitted in [DATE]. It is clear that we cannot simply assume that agreements negotiated will be fulfilled. We must take the [NORP] compliance record into account, both in the development of our defense program and in our approach to arms control. In our discussions with [GPE], we will work to remove the obstacles which threaten to undermine existing agreements and a broader arms control process. Examples I have cited illustrate why our relationship with [GPE] is not what it should be. We have a long way to go, but we are determined to try and try again. We may have to start in small ways, but start we must. In working on these tasks, our approach is based on [CARDINAL] guiding principles-realism, strength, and dialog.

I would make [CARDINAL] points on that. Number [CARDINAL] is that we will be putting in place a snapback provision so that if they cheat on the nuclear deal, the sanctions automatically go back into place; we do not have to ask Mr. [PERSON]'s permission, for example, to put sanctions back. Number [CARDINAL], we should not assume that we can perpetuate the sanctions forever anyway. There is a shelf life on the sanctions, because the reason the international community agreed was to get to the table to deal with the nuclear issue, not to deal with all of these other issues. So we will get a diminishing return just on maintaining sanctions. Number [CARDINAL], Mr. [PERSON] was elected specifically in order to strengthen the [NORP] economy. There is enormous poitical pressure on them - as I said, they have lost [DATE] of economic growth. Their economy has been contracting [DATE]. And it is true that out of [MONEY] or [MONEY], of course the [ORG], [ORG], they are going to want to get their piece. But the fact is, is that the great danger that the region has faced from [GPE] is not because they have so much money. Their budget - their military budget is [MONEY] compared to [MONEY] for [GPE] - I just met with them. They have a low-tech but very effective mechanism of financing proxies, of creating chaos in regions. And they have also shown themselves, regardless of sanctions, to be willing to finance [ORG] with rockets and others even in the face of sanctions. So the question then becomes are they going to suddenly be able to finance [CARDINAL] times the number of [ORG] fighters? Probably not. I see. [INTERVIEWED], you know I do - I know you are running out of time. Yes. But you got me all stirred up. So perhaps you will give us [TIME]. I will give you [TIME].

Anyway, let me talk about the trip from my perspective, and we will kind of rotate around. Everybody will get [CARDINAL] question; hopefully everybody will get [CARDINAL]. First, I am looking forward to my trip. Obviously, [CARDINAL] of the main purposes of the trip is to go speak about development, world development, in [GPE]. I will lay out there for the world leaders what- I already did so in our country-which is [ORG], of a fund that will ultimately be [MONEY] a year. It starts at [MONEY], [MONEY], and then will go up to [MONEY], and then will be at [MONEY] in [DATE] and will remain at [MONEY].

And countries that practice good habits will get money. Now, this is on top of roughly [MONEY] which we spend already in direct development aid, not including other projects, assistance to the [ORG] organizations, et cetera. Also, I am really looking forward to seeing my friend the President of [GPE]. He was my friend [DATE]; he was my friend after September the 11th; he will be my friend for a long period of time because I know him well. I respect him a lot. We have got a very good relationship, and obviously, we have got a very important bilateral relationship. So we are going to have a-we will have a discussion about issues that are common issues.

I could not go out I think it would have been actually a negative factor if I had gone out before the [ORG] went home, because people would think, What is [INTERVIEWED] doing trying to tell me how to vote for the next President when he is got a job to do back in [GPE]? Now, when they did go home, I went to [GPE]. I spent [DATE] in [GPE] trying to help my wife and our candidates here.

And that could be aided and abetted also if they would recognize some responsibility in compensation for the families of the victims. [INTERVIEWED], do you think there may be some sort of a high-level political dispute going on in the [ORG], that the statements by these lower level officials, which were just referred to, may represent and in fact there is not unanimity in there on what happened? I would not hazard a guess on that. But I do say that there is evidence that is a little different than what we usually expect, because usually the official reply comes out with unanimous support over there, and that is it, and that is the story everyone tells. So, this has been a little different, that there have been voices that have begun now. They were not heard for quite a while. In fact, there was such a difference in the stories that it just further added to the evidence of how deliberate and despicable this act was. Most people are tending to forget that their first statement was that they just did not know anything about it. It just disappeared from their radar. And then when the evidence was presented that it had been shot down and that they were responsible for that, suddenly they come up with a new story about spy plane and so forth. No one's mentioned this yet, but is not that a pretty hardthe idea of errora pretty hard thing to believe, when that plane is [CARDINAL] on a regular schedule, that at least every week is flying that same route and at the same time of day? [INTERVIEWED] are your plans firm [GPE]? What is that? Are your plans firm for [GPE]? Well, the trip is still planned.

And at that point the process has broken down. [NORP] have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which [NORP] have left a seat open when a [NORP] [INTERVIEWED] was in office simply because they did not like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court. Justice [PERSON] was confirmed by [PERSON], and I am quite certain that there were a whole lot of [NORP] senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in [DATE] of [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]'s office.

And my simple pitch to them is, be fair not to ignore politics. I am not demanding that [NORP] vote for [PERSON], but do not stop the process in its tracks because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it is got to stop. A good place for it to stop is when we are talking about a [ORG] seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the [NORP] themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court. Are you taking this on the road? Well, you know, I am going to make the case I am going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge [PERSON] a hearing; give him a vote.

{"id":1016,"text":"Well, if I can come back to the economic problem, [INTERVIEWED], the latest figures on the [GPE].. export performance- they paint a rather grim picture. It is understood that the [GPE].. trade deficit-trade imbalance will reach [MONEY] [MONEY] [DATE], compounding, it seems, the deficit problem that already exists. How can interest rates really come down under such auspices? And what will you tell your partners at [GPE], who are worried stiff already about interest rates and about the high dollar that it is created and the capital that comes out of their economies into banks in this country? What are you going to tell your partners about this? Well, the trade imbalance-I do not think it has anything to do with the interest rates. The trade imbalance that you have mentioned there, as a matter of fact, is due to the value of the dollar in comparison to other currencies, and this is part of the worldwide recession that is been going on. But our imports are actually responsible for [CARDINAL] of the recovery of our trading partners now. And there is another element that we do not consider in the balance of trade, but that is capital investment from outside [GPE] in our country. And yet, that is a kind of balance to this imbalance. We'd like very much to be exporting more than we are, but we realize that our recovery started earlier and has been faster than it has in the other countries. And so the result is they have been less able to buy. And the very fact, as I say, that we are continuing to import is helping that recovery. And I think that this will move to change that. Now, we get to the deficit, which is-every country has one right now-the spending over and above revenues in government functions. We have a program right now that is in conference committee before the [ORG] and [ORG] to work out the differences in their two versions of what I have called a down payment. And that is a [DATE] program to-certain, some revenue increases-but both domestic spending and some reductions in defense spending that will not set us back too much in our program.

[INTERVIEWED], this has been a bitter, nasty campaign season across the country in which [NORP] have made you the issue of local races in commercials linking you directly to the local [NORP]. While many [NORP] have held open arms to campaign with you, some have kept their distance. How do you feel that you are the direct target, your administration? Well, they have worked hard on this for a long time. The [NORP] tend to be a Presidential party, and they are unfortunately now very extremist, very negative, and that is what they have tried to do. But you know, there is beginning to be a backlash. First of all, the [NORP] people see that I am keeping the commitments I made to them in [DATE]. In [DATE], we have moved the country forward. We are making the Government work for ordinary [NORP] with things like family leave and college loans. We have reduced the debt. We have reduced the size of [ORG]. We have got more jobs coming into this economy. The world is safer and more prosperous than it was when I took office. People are feeling that, and I do not believe they are going to buy these [NORP] promises in this contract, this [MONEY] worth of hot check promises to go back to [DATE]'s and trickle-down economics. I also would point out, [INTERVIEWER], you know, there is beginning to be some division within the [NORP] ranks. People are recoiling; good [NORP] are recoiling from this extremism and this negativism. That is why former First Lady [PERSON] hit [PERSON] and, of course, Mayor [PERSON] supporting Governor [PERSON] I think a very statesman-like decision Mayor [PERSON] out in [GPE] supporting Senator [PERSON], Mrs. [PERSON] in [GPE] attacking the [NORP] candidate for Senator up there. There are a lot of good [NORP] who do not like what has been happening in our country, and they do not like seeing [ORG] being so negative, so bitterly partisan, and so extremist.

They cannot really keep things from coming to a vote in the [ORG], so I think there is a majority for closing the gun show loophole, a majority for banning the importation of large scale ammunition clips. Who could be against that? We have got an assault weapons ban in the country, and then we turn around and make a mockery of it by letting people import these big ammunition clips which they can put on the guns and convert them into assault weapons. There ought to be child trigger locks on guns. Most manufacturers do it anyway. It ought to be a national requirement. But I think we are making progress. I think the action in these [GPE] indicates it; the initiative in [GPE], with the support of many [NORP] officials in [GPE]; the incredibly brave action that [ORG] has taken to try to improve the way it markets and distributes guns and the way those handguns are sold. I hope they will find some resonance among other gun manufacturers. So we are making progress. but this is a brutal fight. The interest behind it, the status quo, are very strong. Do you suppose, if I may-I do not mean to interrupt-you say the interest behind this is very strong. As [PERSON] said to [PERSON], Who are these guys? Well, the [ORG] and other groups even to the right of them, and a lot of people in the [ORG], in [ORG], really agree with them. A handful of [NORP] do. But it is basically a party fight. And again I say, if they had any evidence that we had undermined hunting or undermined sport shooting or even undermined legitimate self-defense, it would be [CARDINAL] thing. They do not . The only evidence they have is we have kept handguns out of the hands of [CARDINAL] felons, fugitives, and stalkers.

And that is a reflection of a genuine sense on the part of a lot of countries out there that this issue continues to fester, is not getting resolved, and that nobody is willing to take the leap to bring it to closure. In that kind of environment, where you have got a partner on the other side who is prepared to negotiate seriously, who does not engage in some of the wild rhetoric that so often you see in the [NORP] world when it comes to [GPE], who has shown himself committed to maintaining order within [GPE] and [ORG] and to cooperate with [NORP] around their security concerns for us to not seize this moment I think would be a great mistake.

With permanent borders. And has an opportunity also to take advantage of a potential realignment of interests in the region, as many of the [NORP] countries see a common threat in [GPE].

First of all, our nation is being destroyed, but you are not going to have a future in [DATE] or [DATE] if you do not find out how they cheated with [CARDINAL] and even [CARDINAL] of votes, because you will not win anything.

Your intentions aside like you stated them out there in the speech, why should not we expect that you are going to leave behind an economy that is fragile, continued income inequality, and a weakened middle class? Well, obviously, what [ORG] does matters. As I said in the speech, the economy is far stronger now than it was [DATE]. Most economists believe that growth will actually pick up [DATE] and [DATE]. And the [CARDINAL] thing that could really screw things up would be if you have a manufactured crisis and [NORP] choose to play brinksmanship all over again. And I am glad to see that there are folks in the [ORG] who I think have already indicated that that is not good policy. We can have debates about fiscal issues without precipitating a crisis. Certainly the idea that we would not pay our bills and plunge not just [GPE] but potentially the world into another financial crisis makes absolutely no sense. But what I also said out there is true that if we stand pat, if we do not do anything, then growth will be slower than it should be. Unemployment will not go down as fast as it should. Income inequality will continue to rise. Wages, incomes, savings rates for middle-class families will continue to be relatively flat. And that is not a future that we should accept. So the entire intention of the speech is to make sure that we are focused on the right thing. It does not mean that I expect [NORP] to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity. And I want to make sure that all of us in [GPE] are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we have spent over [DATE] arguing about how we reduce the deficits.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjackiecalmesandmichaeldshearthenewyorktimes","title":"Barack Obama Interview with Jackie Calmes and Michael D.

If [DATE] from now [GPE] is still isolated from the rest of the world, and particularly with no communication with [GPE], there is a great danger that due to that isolation we might end in finding that our differences were ones that we could not talk about, and we might end up fighting about. I believe we have got to avoid that. I believe the time to start avoiding that is [DATE], to make this an open world in which we negotiate rather than confront those who differ with us around the world. In that goal, let me say we have bipartisan support. I think we have the support of all generations. There is one other thing I would like to say before we have a chance to meet some of you. As we build this generation of peace, we also want a new prosperity that is based not on war, but on peace, in which production for peace provides the jobs that [NORP] need.

And none of us can control the time and place in which we live and the kinds of things that happen. We can only control our reaction to it. At the time I did the best I could. And you know, of course, from what came out that I felt-I had very mixed feelings about it. I tried to get myself even back into the draft because I was so confused about it. But I did the best I could at that time, and I am doing the best I can now. [CARDINAL] of the things that I think we learned from that war is that even when we are extremely well-motivated, heroic, and willing to die in large numbers, we cannot win a fight for someone else. We can support other people on their own land fighting for their own destiny, but we cannot win a fight for someone else. There are limits to what we can do. And the enormous reaction after that war happened and after the [NORP] forces collapsed [DATE] after our final withdrawal almost caused our country to go into a shell for a while. That was also bad. First we overreached, and then we did not do perhaps what we should have done to sort of stick a stake in the ground. And what I am determined to do is learn as much as I can from history but not be imprisoned by it and certainly not be bogged down by it. I have a job to do now. And nobody else in the world has it but me.

We have brought ourselves to a time of transition, from war toward peace, and this is a good time to gain some perspective on where we are and where we are headed. [DATE] I am sending to the [ORG] my second [DATE] comprehensive report on the conduct of our foreign affairs. It discusses not only what we have done but why we have done it, and how we intend to proceed in the future. I do not intend to summarize all that is in my detailed report on foreign policy at this time. Instead, I would like to focus on [CARDINAL] key points: How we are getting out of the war this Nation has been in for [DATE]; How we have created a new and different foreign policy approach for [GPE] in a greatly changed world; and How we are applying that approach in working with others to build a lasting peace. The most immediate and anguishing problem that faced this [ORG] [DATE] was the war in [GPE]. We have come a long way since then. [DATE], when this [ORG] took office, there were [CARDINAL], 000 [NORP] in [GPE]. Within [DATE] we will have brought home [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] men, and [DATE] I will announce a new schedule of withdrawals. [DATE], our casualties [DATE] were [CARDINAL] times as high as they are [DATE]. [DATE], the additional demands of the Vietnam war cost us [MONEY] per year. That cost has been cut in [CARDINAL]. Much of the progress in [GPE] was due to the success of the allied operations against the enemy sanctuaries in [GPE] [DATE]. The clear proof is in this figure: [NORP] casualties after [GPE] have been [CARDINAL] the rate they were before [GPE].

We have saved [CARDINAL] of lives and opened up our country we opened our country back up. And soon, we will end the public health emergency. But that is called a public health emergency.

We are close to some breakthroughs that will achieve an economic and national security objective. And I have enjoyed traveling around and talking to these scientists and engineers that are really excited about how close we are to some technological breakthroughs. [DATE], talking to the [CARDINAL] scientists involved with the cellulosic ethanol projects was exciting. These guys are pretty fired up about it all, and they realize we have got a chance to change our driving habits. I do want to talk about this port issue. A foreign company manages some of our ports. They have entered into a transaction with another foreign company to manage our ports. This is a process that has been extensively reviewed, particularly from the point of view as to whether or not I can say to the [NORP] people, This project will not jeopardize our security. It is been looked at by those who have been charged with the security of our country. And I believe the deal should go forward. This company operates all around the world. I have the list somewhere. We can get you the list. They are in [GPE] and elsewhere [GPE]. They in working with our folks, they have agreed to make sure that their coordination with our security folks is good and solid. I really do not understand why it is okay for a [NORP] company to operate our ports but not a company from the Middle East, when our experts are convinced that port security is not an issue; that having worked with this company, they are convinced that these they will work with those who are in charge of [ORG] responsibility for securing the ports they will work hand in glove. I want to remind people that when we first put out the Container Security Initiative, the CSI, which was a new way to secure our ports, [GPE] was [CARDINAL] of the first countries to sign up. In other words, we are receiving goods from ports out of the [GPE] as well as where this company operates.

Now, let us turn to the policy areas. We inherited a very difficult economic situation. The rate of inflation was somewhere [PERCENT], the highest in [DATE]. That was our immediate economic problem, and we undertook some activities both fiscally and in a monetary sense to correct the situation. I am glad to report that it is now somewhere between [PERCENT] per annum. That is too high, and we had a little setback the last announcement on the CPI, the Consumer Price Index. In fact, it indicates it is going to go up [PERCENT] if it continues at this rate. Well, I do not think that is the new wholesale price figure that came out [TIME]. But if you annualize [DATE] of the Wholesale Price Index, it shows it is [CARDINAL], because we had [DATE] of, as I recall, negative increases in the Wholesale Price Index. So, I think you have to look at it in the broad span. We have made significant progress in the field of inflation, and we are going to continue to do so. It is important. Then, of course, we were faced in [DATE] with a precipitous drop in employment and a tremendous increase in unemployment. We adjusted our economic policies to meet that problem without sacrificing our effort against inflation. We did have an increase of unemployment up to [PERCENT] much, much too high but [DATE] the unemployment figure has gone down from [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL], and the most encouraging part is the fact that we have had an increase in employment of [CARDINAL], 000, as I recall the figure. That is the encouraging thing. We are putting people back to work even though the unemployment figure is still too high.

Now, it is tough to pass in this [ORG] because most of the [NORP] agree with the [ORG] that guns are different, and even though it might save lives, we should not do it. But I think it is very important. There is a practical problem with the guns, of course. There are [CARDINAL] of them already out there. But I think if we would begin the process of making handgun owners get a license before they can buy a gun, pass a [PERSON] background check, and then have a gun safety course, I think it would make a difference. I think if we did that, plus had child safety locks, closed the big loophole in the background registration law by covering the gun shows and the urban flea markets, and then continue this technology into safe guns so that as soon as possible we can sell guns and adjust them so that, by fingerprints, they can only be fired by the adults who own them, all these things together would make our country a much safer place. And I am going to continue to fight for it. We need to start by passing this legislation that the [ORG] has had for [DATE] now. The [ORG] passed a pretty strong law, with the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote. The [ORG] passed a much weaker law. And they have just been sitting on this for [DATE]. I hope that [DATE] will finally move the [ORG] to act. And I am going to meet with the leading conferees on the [CARDINAL] bills in [DATE] to try to do that. But you are not prepared to take the step to try to regulate guns? I think that the most important thing we can do now is to pass the legislation before the [ORG], and then try to pass legislation that would require the owners themselves, people who want to buy handguns, to be licenses, just as car drivers are.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdanratherthecbseveningnews","title":"Interview With Dan Rather of the CBS Evening News","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-dan-rather-the-cbs-evening-news","publication_date":"02-03-2000","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

Has there been any progress from the renewed contacts with [GPE] on the nuclear issue, the meetings going on in [GPE]? I have seen the reports of those meetings, but I do not have any readout or update on those meetings to give you at this point. What do you hope -- what does [ORG] hope it will lead to? Well, we certainly -- what we hope they will lead to eventually is for [NORP] to abandon their nuclear weapons program and abide by the international standards that so much of the rest of the world community follows. That is the eventual goal here. That certainly is the goal of our diplomatic efforts. It is the goal of the diplomatic efforts of the [CARDINAL]-party talks. But I do not have anything new to update you on in terms of the progress toward that goal. [INTERVIEWED1], just to I hope clarify this [GPE] issue [CARDINAL] more time. I think maybe the way to clarify this is to ask you sort of directly, does the administration now believe that military action might be warranted in the case of [GPE]? I do not want to speculate about what might be warranted in the future. What we have said on this issue is that further militarizing the situation in [GPE] at this point in time is not a wise course -- that is not the wise policy course to pursue at this point. What we are engaged in now with our partners and other countries in the region is an effort to see if there is things that we can do to bring humanitarian relief and aid to those who are affected by the violence, including medical supplies, to see if there are things that we can do to offer support to [ORG], to speed a democratic transition, a political solution in [GPE]; and to increase the pressure through sanctions on the [PERSON] regime.

We have had just unbelievable crowds beginning in [GPE] and running all the way across the State, west to east. I just appreciate, beyond any words that I can express, my gratitude for your patience, your understanding, and your warm and hospitable reaction to our coming in at this time. This trip to [GPE] has been a great lift, and it has been a lift because I am convinced that the people of [GPE] are interested in having their election decided by them and not by the politicians in [GPE], D.C. It was my privilege to come to your State Capitol in [DATE] and to urge at that time that the right answer was by the people and the wrong answer was by the politicians in [GPE] Capital. You have that opportunity now. You have probably the greatest opportunity to make a decisive decision [DATE]. I am proud to be here on behalf of a friend of mine, [PERSON], but I am equally proud to be in the great State of [GPE] because I am here representing, along with others, a unified party, a party that is working together on behalf of [PERSON] election. Governor [PERSON], [TIME] Governor [PERSON], [TIME] and he may be here now Senator [PERSON], Congressman [PERSON] was with us all I am trying to say is we have presented a unified front because we think it is a crucial election. I am delighted to see [PERSON] here who so ably represents your area, and she, like all of us, is standing steadfast on behalf of [PERSON]. Let me ask you or tell you, if I might, why we stand together. Why are we interested in the election of [PERSON]? [PERSON] believes in a strong national defense with the [ORG], the [ORG], [ORG], and the [ORG] first and not second best, and that is important to the maintenance of peace throughout the world.

I have campaigned here on [CARDINAL] occasion, and I always notice how proudly the flag waves in the south [GPE] wind. It sort of says to visitors that the people here take patriotism seriously. Well, together we are going to make certain that our country always stands for freedom and our flag continues to wave proudly. There is a new spirit in [GPE], and I am pleased to call it the new patriotism. All over the country, [NORP] are casting away the pessimism and self-doubt of [DATE].

Well, it is been tough, but together we have, all of us and all of you, made a new beginning. We still have more to do, but I think we are headed in the right direction. And I think this election offers the clearest choice in [DATE] a choice of whether we go forward together to build on our own progress, or whether we go back to the defeatism and despair of the unhappy past. Let me ask you. Does anyone want to go back to the days of high inflation? Anyone want to go back to the days of economic stagnation and a heavier and heavier tax burden? No, you do not want to go back, and the [NORP] people do not want to go back. They want to keep moving forward to jobs and opportunity, forward to stable prices and economic expansion, forward to a safer and a stronger [GPE].

We may be able to reverse Parkinson's. We may be able to reverse Alzheimer's. So there is going to be a lot of things that are different about aging in the future. We are going to have to totally rethink it in ways we cannot imagine.

That might happen. It may take [DATE], but it would not surprise me if it happened simply because of the lifestyle, the length of life we are looking at.

How do you stop campaigning? I do not know. I do like politics. But I like governance, too. I like policy. I liked it all.

But before that, I kept reading about all these non in the line of national security all these computer hackers. You know, I am technologically challenged. I can do E-mail and a few other things, you know. But it struck me that we were going to have to find some way to try to deal with that, too, because of the defense implications, as well as the other possibilities. And I have had all kinds of I also find that reading novels, futuristic novels sometimes people with an imagination are not wrong [PERSON]'s novel about biological warfare, which is very much based on Hot Zone or Cobra Event ? Which one impressed you? The Cobra Event. That is the one. Well, The Hot Zone was interesting to me because of the Ebola thing, because that was a fact book. But I thought The Cobra Event was interesting, especially when he said what his sources were, which seemed fairly credible to me. And then I read another book about a group of terrorists shutting down the telephone networks in the Northeast and the Midwest. What was that? Do you remember? I cannot remember. I read so many things. I cannot remember. [DATE]. But anyway, when I and a lot of times it is just for thrills, but a lot of times these people are not far off.

I have also solicited opinions from people working on the genome project, for example, and about what the implications of that might be for dealing with biological warfare.

It depends on what the standard is. I was in a no-win if the only way I win is to do exactly what I think is right and- Which would have been, sign them and let them in, right? Yes. But I think it is very important when you hear the criticism of it from the left, if you will. What I said was that I thought that status should be the judge-should not be the judge. It ought to be conduct, not your orientation. That is what the policy is now. I further said that I thought a person ought to be able to say, I am gay. And as long as they did not do anything that violated the rules, they should be able to stay. That is now true. That is only true in a restricted way. Now if you say it, it creates a presumption that you are going to do something wrong while you are in the military, but you are given the opportunity to present evidence that you will not , to convince, in effect, your commander that you will observe the rules. But I never promised to change the rules of conduct. That is in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That is the way it is. Now, to be fair to the Joint Chiefs, they agreed to go further on matters of privacy and association than I ever discussed in the campaign. So this provides dramatically increased protection and a range of privacy for present and future soldiers who happen to be homosexuals but happen to be good military people. So in other words, you filled your promise. I did, except for the fact that we were not able to do precisely what I wanted, which was to give people the freedom to acknowledge their sexual orientation as long as they were following the rules of conduct. [DATE] if you do that, it can get you in trouble, but you have the option to convince your commander that you really are following the rules. So I do not think it goes quite as far as I wanted on statements. On the other hand, it goes quite a bit further to protect private conduct on the rules of investigation than I anticipated.

[GPE] had always been paranoid about this. But [PERSON] was right. This was not a threat to them. And this new program will not be a threat to them. So, you know, my task here was not to negotiate with the [NORP]. The [NORP] do not make determinations about our -- what our defense posture is. We have made a decision about what will be best to protect the [NORP] people, as well as our troops in Europe and our Allies. If the byproduct of it is that the [NORP] feel a little less paranoid, and are now willing to work more effectively with us to deal with threats like ballistic missiles from [GPE] or the nuclear development in [GPE] , you know, then that is a bonus.

{"id":119,"text":"So the real question is-the question I asked our people to look at, and we spent lots of time on it [DATE]-is whether we could present to the [ORG] a budget that was not full of gimmicks, that reflected what the [ORG] spent [DATE], inflation in areas where with-had that-for example, in the defense area where we know they intended-and still could we do that based on what we now believe the figures are and what our costs are in health care programs and other things and still get this country out of debt in [DATE] and still not spend the [ORG] surplus. And the answer, we believe, is yes, that you can avoid spending the [ORG] surplus, continue to get the country out of debt in [DATE], and have a spending program for [DATE] that reflects the decisions made by the [ORG] in [DATE], without all those gimmicks. And you could still have a modest tax cut, nothing anywhere near the high end of what people had talked about in the campaign and what the [ORG] tried to do [DATE], but you could still have a modest one. So I think this is an honest budget that is fiscally responsible and still gets us out of debt. And I believe that we ought to embrace these big challenges, and I think that our children will judge us very well if we do and somewhat harshly if we do not . Because in my lifetime- you have heard me say this over and over again, but I am not young any more. I am [DATE]. In my lifetime we have never had this combination of economic prosperity, social progress, national self-confidence, with the absence of internal crisis or external threat. Not that we have no problems at home or no threats abroad, but none of it is sufficient to derail us from trying to imagine the future and then go after it. And it seems the one-that one of the elements of that future ought to be a commitment to take [GPE] out of debt. Another element of the future ought to be a commitment from going to-what I said [DATE]-trying to make our country the safest big country in the world. Another element of that future ought to be trying to prove that we can grow the economy and dramatically reduce the global warming by maximizing technology.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfrancinekieferandskipthurmanthechristiansciencemonitorboston","title":"Interview With Francine Kiefer and Skip Thurman of the Christian Science Monitor in Boston","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-francine-kiefer-and-skip-thurman-the-christian-science-monitor-boston","publication_date":"18-01-2000","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

It may surprise you, but the lights on this establishment are $[MONEY] a month alone, so you can imagine how many checks will have to have deductions to even pay the light bill. I am reminded of the story that the Postmaster General told me about getting a letter from a little boy who had lost his father and whose widowed mother was having difficulty making ends meet. He wrote a letter to the Lord and said, Dear God: Please send mom $[MONEY] to help with the family. The letter wound up on the Postmaster General's desk and he was quite touched by it.

If you do not mind, when you send it to momma this time, do not route it through [GPE], because they deducted [PERCENT] of it there.

You businessmen have a very unique role in our Government, and a very special responsibility. You are the symbols of the free enterprise system. You are what makes the difference in the type of government we have and the type that our challenger has. Someone asked me the other day if I did not think I was making a rather dangerous venture when, contrary to the practice of [DATE], I sent a budget to [ORG] that did not add [MONEY] on to take care of increased population and increased needs, and by withholding that amount out of the economic bloodstream if I did not think we would lack the financial stimulus necessary to give us the prosperity we wanted.

I think that in the end, [GPE]'s leaders will make determinations based on what they believe is best for the security of [GPE], and that is entirely appropriate. When we present our views and our strategy approach, we try to put all our cards on the table, to describe how we are thinking about these issues. We try to back those up with facts and evidence.

That is a good way to phrase it. And my answer is: there is no good reason to doubt me on these issues. Some of it has to do with the fact that in this country and in our media, this gets wrapped up with politics. And I do not think that is any secret. And if you have a set of political actors who want to see if they can drive a wedge not between [GPE] and [GPE], but between [PERSON] and a [NORP] [NORP] vote that has historically been very supportive of his candidacy, then it is good to try to fan doubts and raise questions.

Well, we want the program. When I responded to the-I responded to the families.

You know, from the very beginning-almost the very beginning, once we established that it was practical-there have been people up there conducting experiments-scientists, for example, who are not astronauts, but who are there to carry on the great advances that have come to us by way of those shuttle experiments-in medicine and other things-are so great that I do not see any reason why this policy should not continue.

And even after we lost the majorities in [ORG], I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we have got - a classic example being immigration reform, where I held off for [DATE] in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution - one that, by the way, did pass through the [ORG] on a bipartisan basis with our help. I was very proud of that. I went out of my way to make sure our help was behind the scenes so that [NORP] did not feel as if it was going to hurt them politically. At the end of the day, [PERSON] and the [ORG] [NORP] could not pull the trigger on getting it done.

So my suggestion to the president-elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it is harder to undo. And that does not mean, though, that he is not going to come in and look at the various agencies and see the rules we have passed and if he wants to reverse some of those rules, that is part of the democratic process. That is , you know, why I tell people to vote because it turns out elections mean something. And this election means even more because the presidency, as has been widely noted, is so powerful. It is grown more powerful over generations. You used your power in certain ways, and even in ways that you'd suggested in the past might be beyond your authority. Well, no, I do not think I have done that. If I am thinking of immigration, for example. Well, what I said with immigration reform was that I could not simply sign a document that legalized [CARDINAL] people who had come here illegally and were currently undocumented.

It is just not a [GPE] thing; it is its own-liberty is something that everybody yearns for. And freer the world becomes, the more prosperous the world becomes and the more likely people will not be mired in poverty. Nations that build institutions that secure the rule of law and respect human dignity also are more likely to create an economic climate that fosters investment and growth. And so we support the rise of free and democratic societies across the world. And the story of freedom is one of the really, really interesting chapters of [DATE], when you think about it. From [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE], people have gone to the polls and elected their leaders. In [DATE], [CARDINAL] people have joined the ranks of the free. That is an astonishing development when you think about it. And it is a positive development for those of us who care deeply about global poverty. As more people gain their freedom, they will also gain the opportunity to build a better life. That is a fact of life. And so this country has got to be confident in our willingness, in our desire to help people- to help free people from the clutches of tyrants. I said in my second Inaugural speech, The goal of this country ought to be to end tyranny in [DATE]. I could have easily have said, [CARDINAL] way to reduce global poverty is to reduce tyranny in [DATE]. Free peoples need to do more than cast their ballots. We recognize that. Going to the polls is not the kind of freedom necessary to reduce global poverty. It is just the beginning of a process to reduce global poverty. And so [GPE] has an obligation to help others build the institutions necessary-in a civil society-necessary to be able to deal in a-with the advent of freedom.

That is what a robust democracy demands. That is what helps set us apart as a nation. But there is a reason the tragedy in [GPE] gave us pause.

[INTERVIEWED], I do not want to try and pry any secrets out of you, but could we find out what you are taking to [GPE] in your diplomatic briefcase, so to speak, and what you hope to bring back from there? Well, as I said earlier, the same things that we have talked about before and tried to come together in a meeting of the minds-basically, those [CARDINAL] major areas. Yes, that is what we will talk about. Now, I recognize that [CARDINAL] country cannot dictate to another as to how they must run their own affairs, and maybe some of the things that we will talk about are things that I believe maybe we could be-based on our own experience-be helpful; for example, among human rights. I was quite interested recently when the General Secretary, meeting with the leaders of your [ORG], lessened some of the restrictions that government had imposed on the practice of that religion. Well, I have wondered if a further expansion of that-you see, our country came into being because people were being denied, in other countries, the right to worship God as they saw fit. And so, they left those countries and came to this new land as pioneers in order to worship. Well, I have just wondered if there is not a field there in your own country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice religion in the ways they chose. And here we call it separation of church and state. The government cannot deny people the right to worship, but by the same token, the churches cannot impose on government their beliefs. I think that really the question of human rights deserves lots of discussion.

An increase in the judicial personnel, which I earnestly recommend, would result in a hardly perceptible percentage of increase in the total [DATE] budget. This result should not be achieved, however, merely by creating new judicial positions in specific circuits or districts. The reform should be effectuated on the basis of a consistent system which would revitalize our whole judicial structure and assure the activity of judges at places where the accumulation of business is greatest. As congestion is a varying factor and cannot be foreseen, the system should be flexible and should permit the temporary assignment of judges to points where they appear to be most needed.

It was [DATE] that this institution was first established under a man of great eminence alike in the work of pedagogy and in other fields- Professor [PERSON]. At the time when it was started the public-school system of [GPE] had begun and was in the process of its first development. Now, in the city of [GPE] in attendance upon the public schools, including the night schools, there are [CARDINAL] pupils and over four thousand teachers. The development of the high school, especially during [DATE], has been literally phenomenal. Nothing like our present system of education was known in earlier times. No such system of popular education for the people by the representatives of the people existed. It is, of course, a mere truism to say that the stability and future welfare of our institutions of government depend upon the grade of citizenship turned out from our public schools. And no body of public servants, no body of individuals associated in private life, are better worth the admiration and respect of all who value citizenship at its true worth, than the body composed of the teachers in the public schools throughout the length and breadth of this [ORG]. They have to deal with citizenship in the raw and turn it out something like a finished product. I think that all of us who also endeavor to deal with that citizenship in the raw in our own homes appreciate the burden and the responsibility. The training given in the public schools must, of course, be not merely a training in intellect, but a training in what counts for infinitely more than intellect-a training in character. And the chief factor in that training must be the personal equation of the teachers; the influence exerted, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, by the man or woman who stands in so peculiar a relation to the boys and girls under his or her care-a relation closer, more intricate, and more vital in its after-effects than any other relation save that of parent and child. Wherever a burden of that kind is laid, those who carry it necessarily carry a great responsibility.

[INTERVIEWED], in [DATE], leftist governments have been elected in many countries-I will mention [CARDINAL], for example-last ones, [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. Are you worried about this tendency in Latin America? You know, the thing-first of all, I like the fact that the countries in our neighborhood are free and people get to decide who the governments-who is in the government. I like that. I think it is great. I would be worried if there are policies which ruin economies. That would worry me-in other words, if these governments make decisions that end up making it very difficult for people to make a living and\/or for there to be more wealth throughout the society. I would be worried if there is no free press-in other words, if institutions that are necessary for a free society were undermined. I would be worried, of course, if just the basic needs of the people were not met. And so I applaud elections. I look forward to these governments responding to the real needs of the people.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithenriquegratasunivision","title":"Interview With Enrique Gratas of Univision","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-enrique-gratas-univision","publication_date":"07-03-2007","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["George W.

I remember when the moment came when the countries-the new countries admitted to [ORG] came into the room that I was sitting in, and I turned to the person I was sitting next to and said, It is going to be so important for [ORG] to have these fresh-these new countries, because they bring a fresh outlook to freedom. These are people that have recently lived under, in this case, communism and realized what it means to be free, and it is going to be very important. And so [GPE] is very high on my radar screen.

I said, Do you understand, friend, that you have got problems in the Baltics? You have got problems with [GPE] because people do not like-the remembrances of the time of communism are unpleasant remembrances, and you need to work with these young democracies. I explained to him that it is best that there be democracies on his border, free countries, because free countries do not attack people; free countries listen to the hopes and aspirations of people.

I can tell them we have been through a tough time. We have been through a recession. And I say through because technically I do not believe this country is in a recession. In this area, we have had some economic dislocations because of our success, the success in beating down a military threat that still exists, incidentally, but has enabled us to make some substantial cutbacks on defense. And so, what we have got to do is to incent this economy in the ways I have been proposing to the [ORG] for [DATE].

For order among [ORG] presupposes something enduring some system of justice under which individuals, over a long period of time, are willing to live.

The process of the elimination of [ORG] proceeded according to plan through [DATE] and well into [DATE], until the schedule was shot to pieces by the unbeatable defenders of [GPE]. The enemies of democracy were wrong in their calculations for a very simple reason. They were wrong because they believed that democracy could not adjust itself to the terrible reality of a world at war. They believed that democracy, because of its profound respect for the rights of man, would never arm itself to fight. They believed that democracy, because of its will to live at peace with its neighbors, could not mobilize its energies even in its own defense. They know now that democracy can still remain democracy, and speak, and reach conclusions, and arm itself adequately for defense. From the bureaus of propaganda of the [NORP] powers came the confident prophecy that the conquest of our country would be an inside job a job accomplished not by overpowering invasion from without, but by disrupting confusion and disunion and moral disintegration from within.

The danger to [GPE] is not in the direction of the failure to maintain its economic position, but in the direction of the failure to maintain its ideals. The principle of service is not to be confounded with a weak and impractical sentimentalism. It does not mean that either the individual or the nation is to assume the burdens which ought to be borne by others. It is warranted in considering self to the extent of recognizing that it is justifiable to accumulate and hold the resources which must necessarily be used to serve ourselves, our own household, and our own nation. But it does not stop there. It recognizes also the necessity of serving others, and when the need arises for meeting a moral requirement, of making individual and national sacrifices sufficient to maintain the cause of righteousness. Some of the recent developments in [GPE] have revealed the dangers to which I refer in a very dramatic way. Beginning [DATE] our country entered a period when conditions were altogether artificial and abnormal, culminating in the strained and lurid events of our participation in the war. The old standards of action were either suspended or entirely cast aside. Altogether too many of those in a position to do so began to take advantage of the necessities of the situation for their own profit. Finally nearly all of those in responsible positions throughout the entire civilized world had but [CARDINAL] main object in view, which was the winning of the war. They began to make almost every consideration and motive subsidiary to that great effort. Totally inconceivable amounts of money were raised and expended with a lavishness which [DATE] before would have been believed impossible, and which now seems like some wild nightmare. Notwithstanding the great wave of patriotic fervor which swept over the land; notwithstanding the tremendous sacrifices which the people in every walk of life made, and stood ready to make; almost unconsciously these conditions developed, which I mention not for any purpose now to criticize, where the least scrupulous became the greatest gainers and a considerable part of our population was thrown into a morbid financial state of mind, which even the best intentioned did not wholly escape. The desire for profits and more profits kept on increasing, and the quest for easy money became well-nigh universal.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0","title":"Address to the Annual Luncheon of the Associated Press in New York City","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/address-the-annual-luncheon-the-associated-press-new-york-city-0","publication_date":"22-04-1924","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Calvin Coolidge"],"gender":["M"]}}

There is a [NORP] proverb, a religious proverb, that says, God gave burdens, also shoulders. A simple proverb it does not say God gave us burdens, but he gave us shoulders strong enough to bear them, it just says, God gave burdens, also shoulders. We not only have our own shoulders to carry burdens, but we have others to help, not just to carry burdens but, sometimes, shoulders to cry on. Those shoulders let us bear the burdens of life. And with each generation comes a tremendous challenge, difficulties, and most of those challenges and difficulties are derived from mandatory change. We tend to think the changes that take place in our own life are the greatest that have ever afflicted any generation, but this is not true. Our early forebears in this Nation offered their lives, all their belongings, even their family security, to achieve freedom, liberty. Later, our Nation was torn by a War Between the States. Pioneers moved West. The changes that took place in individual lives then were much greater than those that take place [DATE]. But we learned in a time of change, no matter which generation it is, that there are some things which do not change. Those things can be described as the elements of a good family truth, unselfishness, idealism, commitment, courage, understanding, morality, security, love. As a father, I understand those things. As a husband, I understand those things. As President, I understand the same things. There are legitimate roles for a government to perform: to assure that our Nation lives in peace; to assure that our people have an opportunity for employment, for jobs, to use what talent God might have given them in a sustained and productive way; to eliminate the threats to society, to the family drugs, crime; to initiate preventive health care; to provide for better education, transportation, security; to cut down on some of the afflictions, such as unwanted pregnancies that lead to abortions, things that deeply religious people and others deplore; to raise the ideals of individuals; and to sustain the ideals and morals of a nation itself.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentssaltlakecityutahremarksmormonchurchceremonieshonoringfamilyunity","title":"Salt Lake City, Utah Remarks at Mormon Church Ceremonies Honoring Family Unity.","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/salt-lake-city-utah-remarks-mormon-church-ceremonies-honoring-family-unity","publication_date":"27-11-1978","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Jimmy Carter"],"gender":["M"]}}

And then her gracious invitation to us at [GPE], our ride together and all there, so it was not any surprise that-it was only just reinforced and strengthened as to what a truly fine and gracious lady she is.

And if we will do that, we can then take the prevention programs, for example, in the crime bill we can take the police programs in the crime bill and use them to actually build up people's lives and turn this situation around. It is in many ways the most significant challenge facing our country. We cannot expect to do well over the long run if we continue to lose massive numbers of our children to this kind of lifestyle. Again, we are speaking live with [INTERVIEWED]on [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED], following along those same lines, [DATE] you signed the student loan reform act. In fact, you talked about it a little bit earlier today, authorizing the implementation of what is known as [ORG]. How does this differ from previous efforts to make sure that all those who want a higher education can, in fact, get a higher education in this country. Well, what this student loan bill does is to enable people to borrow money to go to college at lower cost, either lower fees or lower interest rates or both. And then it allows them [CARDINAL] different options about how to repay the money. For example, if someone gets out of school, and they decide to become a teacher, then the teacher let us say the teacher starts and he or she has a low wage in salary in [DATE], you can pay back the loan as a percentage of your income. Then let us suppose at some point in the future you get a higher paying job, and you want to pay the loan off quicker so your interest payments would be lower, you can convert to a different system and repay it in that way. So the [CARDINAL] different things here are, number [CARDINAL], it is a lower cost loan; number [CARDINAL], the repayment terms are much better. Now, in addition to that, we have taken huge amounts of the bureaucracy and paperwork out of this, and we have strengthened the ability of the [ORG] to collect the loan when it is due by involving the [ORG] and other [ORG] agencies in the process.

And the definition of price-you can judge whether or not it is fair, given kind of comparable situations elsewhere. [INTERVIEWER1]'s point is, if you have got a sole source of supply or a significant sole source of supply, sometimes that source of supply can set the market. And I would think that what most consumers would want was fair, transparent pricing. [CARDINAL] way to make sure you have got fair pricing is to have alternative sources of energy so that you are able to make different choices, and that is very difficult, particularly when it comes to natural gas. Gas is a hard product to transport. Gas requires enormous capital investment. Oil can be transferred by cart, by trucks. Gas has to be transferred by pipeline, more or less. Now there is a whole new technology coming, which is liquefied natural gas, so it can be transported by fleet. And so all I would ask is that there be transparency, that there be-that people know fully what the rules are, and that the contracts be open, easy to understand, and honored. And if I may stay with the neighborhood for a second there. You recently hosted the President of [GPE].

I do not propose to be hasty in the selection of this commission. I want time and advice, in order that I may select high-minded men, impartial in their judgment, skilled in the science of the law and our judicial system, clear in their conception of our institutions. Such a commission can perform the greatest of service to our generation. There is another and vastly wider field than the nature of laws and the methods of their enforcement. This is the basic question of the understanding, the ideals, the relationship of the individual citizen to the law itself. It is in this field that the press plays a dominant part. It is almost final in its potency to arouse the interest and consciousness of our people. It can destroy their finer sensibilities or it can invigorate them. I am well aware that the great majority of our important journals [DATE] by day give support to these high ideals. I wonder, sometimes, however, if perhaps a little more support to our laws could not be given in one direction. If, instead of the glamor of romance and heroism which our [NORP] imaginative minds too frequently throw around those who break the law, we would invest with a little romance and heroism those [CARDINAL] of our officers who are endeavoring to enforce the law, it would itself decrease crime. Praise and respect for those who properly enforce the laws and [DATE] condemnation of those who defy the laws would help. Perhaps a little better proportioned balance of news concerning those criminals who are convicted and punished would serve to instill the fear of the law. I need not repeat that absolute freedom of the press to discuss public questions is a foundation stone of [NORP] liberty. I put the question, however, to every individual conscience, whether flippancy is a useful or even legitimate device in such discussions. I do not believe it is. Its effect is as misleading and as distorting of public conscience as deliberate misrepresentation.

The leadership in the [ORG] has the proposed constitutional amendment bottled up and has, thus far, failed to hold the appropriate hearings. Some suggest we should keep religion out of politics. Well, the opposite is also true. Those in politics should keep their hands off of the religious freedom of our people, and especially our children. Earlier I quoted [PERSON].

It would be difficult for me to conceive, President [PERSON] said, of anyone being able to administer the duties of a great office like the Presidency without a belief in the guidance of Divine Providence.

Can you provide any signs of encouragement for the [GPE] farmer? Yes. We have an [GPE] farmer as our Secretary of [ORG]. And we know that this is the whole basis of any economy; has to be that. [CARDINAL] of the things where we believe government can participate and be of help-and we are trying desperately to do this-is to encourage foreign markets, export markets, because there is no question, the [NORP] farmer can and does produce more than the people in our own country can eat, so he has to have an export market. He is been caught worse than most people in the cost-price squeeze of inflation. The cost of the things he buys, even the finished products of the food that he himself grows, when he then buys that in the form of bread and so forth in the market, he finds that he is on the low end of the totem pole when he sells that raw product, but he is paying like everyone else is, the inflated price as it is gone through the industrial processes. We do not believe that government, as we have known in the past, is the answer of a--continuing to control and subsidize the farm.

Because he is President of the whole country, and he believes we need to reach a budget compromise that is balanced, that allows the economy to grow, that secures a rising and thriving middle class, and invests in the economy of the future while reducing our deficits in a responsible way.

We [NORP] realize how much we owe to [GPE], to the courage and sacrifice of the [NORP] people, to the indomitable leadership of outstanding individuals as your memorable predecessors and you yourself, Mr. President, and to the dedicated efforts of [GPE] to achieve a peace based .on freedom and justice for all nations. I wish to take this opportunity to express on behalf of all my countrymen our gratitude towards [GPE] for their share in the liberation of our country. When peace had been achieved, we were faced with a series of new problems. As a result of the war the economy of my country like that of most other [NORP] countries had suffered severe setbacks. The rebuilding and expansion of our means of production and our merchant fleet and the revival of our commerce would not have been completed [DATE] had not the [GPE] Government carried out their large-scale aid programs. Through this assistance [GPE] significantly helped the cause of economic integration in Western Europe. Your country thereby made an inestimable contribution to the unity of the states in our region. It is in my view a major interest, not only of Western Europe, but also of its friends in this hemisphere, that the cause of ever closer cooperation between [NORP] nations should enjoy the sympathy and active support of [GPE]. At the same time dark and menacing clouds were again gathering on the international horizon and prevented the peoples of the world from enjoying the peace for which they had fought so bitterly.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandkingfrederikdenmark","title":"Toasts of the President and King Frederik of Denmark","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/toasts-the-president-and-king-frederik-denmark","publication_date":"11-10-1960","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Dwight D.

{"id":797,"text":"[INTERVIEWED], Senator [PERSON], your old friend, said that early on in your administration, not long after the assassination attempt, that he told you he thought that the Lord saved you out there on the sidewalk, not so much to save the economy but to save the world, and that what he meant by that-to reach some sort of an arms control agreement with the [NORP]. And he said you did not disagree with that. Now, you have recently in the speech at [GPE] said that you are firmly committed to an arms reduction. I was just wondering, the [NORP] have made a proposal now for deep reduction in offensive weapons in return for some restraint on deployment of the space-based defense. Can you accept that in principle? Well, almost all of them in principle-there have been, you know, like the figures and so forth, talking of the weapons. I think because of the mix that each of us sees, we have chosen a different way to go-with what we call the triad-than they have. They have placed more reliance on the intercontinental. And so, there are things that have to be negotiated and worked out. Now, we are still in the process of studying their latest proposal. But I am encouraged because-not only this [CARDINAL] but the first proposals that they began making-it is , to my knowledge, the first time that the [NORP] have ever proposed actually reducing the number of weapons. Well, you may be able to accept that in principle, then-that proposal? Yes, but do not pin me down on this, because, as I say, we are still studying this and- Yes. The other thing is just what kind of priority do you give-I mean, how high a priority do you give on arms control or arms reduction? Would it be possible, for example, to raise the level of the [GPE] talks from ambassadorial level to the level of foreign minister to accelerate the progress there? Well, I do not know. Our negotiators there, we think, are very capable, and I assume the [NORP] think theirs are, too. But whatever way is necessary to get an agreement, we will do. Eventually, of course, it has to come back to the top.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitheleanorcliffjacknelsonandjoelhavemannthelosangelestimes","title":"Interview With Eleanor Cliff, Jack Nelson, and Joel Havemann of the Los Angeles Times","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-eleanor-cliff-jack-nelson-and-joel-havemann-the-los-angeles-times","publication_date":"23-06-1986","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Ronald Reagan"],"gender":["M"]}}

After 9\/11, we also confronted [GPE] over its weapons of mass destruction. The leader of [GPE] made a wise choice. In [DATE], Colonel [PERSON] announced that he would abandon his weapons of mass destruction program. He concluded that the interests of his people would be best served by improving relations with [GPE], and [GPE] turned over its nuclear centrifuges and other deadly equipment to [GPE]. The defeat of [PERSON] also appears to have changed the calculation of [GPE]. According to our intelligence community, the regime in [GPE] had started a nuclear weapons program in [DATE], and they halted a key part of that program in [DATE]. [GPE] recognized that the most effective way to pursue persuade [GPE] to remove its nuclear weapons renounce its nuclear weapons ambitions was to have partners at our side, so we supported an international effort led by our allies in Europe. This diplomacy yielded an encouraging result when [GPE] agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment. Sadly, after the election of President [PERSON], [GPE] reversed course and announced it would begin enriching again. Since then, we have imposed tough sanctions through [ORG] resolutions. We and our partners have offered [GPE] diplomatic and economic incentives to suspend enrichment. We have promised to support a peaceful civilian nuclear program. While [GPE] has not accepted these offers, we have made our bottom line clear: For the safety of our people and the peace of the world, [GPE] will not allow [GPE] to develop a nuclear weapon. Third, [GPE] identified the lack of freedom in the Middle East as a principal cause of the threats coming from the region. We concluded that if the region continued on the path it was headed, if another generation grew up with no hope for the future and no outlet to express its views, the Middle East would continue to simmer in resentment and export violence. To stop this from happening, we have resolved to help the region steer itself toward a better course of freedom and dignity and hope.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesabanforum","title":"Remarks at the Saban Forum","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-the-saban-forum","publication_date":"05-12-2008","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["George W.

This is very much part of an ongoing engagement that we have with the [NORP] leadership at the presidential level and at all the levels in government.

In other words, trade is good for the [NORP] people, and I am going to use the trade promotion authority to bring these benefits to the [NORP] people. Free trade is also a proven strategy for building global prosperity and adding to the momentum of political freedom. Trade is an engine of economic growth.

In our lifetime, trade has helped lift [CARDINAL] of people and whole nations and entire regions out of poverty and put them on the path to prosperity.

And that amounted to quite a percentage, in a reduction. We also, in many of these programs, found that there were people who were above an income level as to where they should be eligible for these programs, and what we did was redirect the attention down. And we have set for ourselves a standard of [PERCENT] of poverty-that that was the limit. Above that, it would have to be an exceptional case. But if they are below [PERCENT] of poverty, they were helped. So, the result was, for example, in school lunches there was a big increase for those people that were truly below the poverty line. What we did do was reduce somewhat the subsidy for the people up above that line. I think in [CARDINAL] instance it prorated out-like the subsidy increased-these are people that pay something for the lunches, but not the full cost-I think [CARDINAL] of those cuts meant that their personal payment was increased [MONEY] per lunch.

Ever since I have been [SPEAKER], we have worked to try to empower the tribes of our Nation. I will never forget [DATE] in [DATE], when I had the chance to welcome leaders of [CARDINAL] [NORP] tribes to [ORG], the first time this had been done sincePresident [PERSON]'s administration, in [DATE]. You know, when I was just a very young boy, I used to go to the county public library in my hometown in [GPE]. I can remember spending [DATE] after day reading histories of [NORP] tribes and biographies of famous chiefs. I remember once I read in the biography of Chief [PERSON] that incredible statement he made, From this day, I will fight no more, forever. It was a noble, powerful, brave thing to do. But as we all know, though many of your ancestors gave up fighting and gave up land and water and mineral rights in exchange for peace, security, health care, and education, [ORG] did not live up to its end of the deal. That was wrong. And I have worked hard to change it. There is nothing more important to me than getting this government-to-government relationship right, but getting it right in a way that will empower you to lift yourselves and your children to fulfill your potential and your dreams, not a patronizing relationship but an empowering one, not a handout but a hand up, a genuine partnership so that your children can live their dreams. As Congressman [PERSON] said, I did ask in the State of the Union Address for the largest budget increases in history for new and existing programs to assist tribal nations. That is why I traveled [DATE] to [GPE] in [GPE], the home of [NORP]. That is why I made [NORP] country an important focus of our new markets initiative. Let me tell you what that is. I believe the only way to keep this economy growing is to bring economic opportunity to the people and the places who have been left behind.

{"id":5596,"text":"Many have been debating [CARDINAL] very important questions: How could we prevent nuclear war, and how could we reduce [NORP] and [NORP] nuclear arsenals? The answers to these questions are not found in simple slogans, but again, in paradoxes. To prevent nuclear war, we must have the capability to deter nuclear war. This means we must keep our strategic forces strong enough to balance those of [GPE]. It must be absolutely clear to the [NORP] that they would have no conceivable advantage in threatening or starting a nuclear war. In seeking to reduce [NORP] and [NORP] nuclear arsenals, we must convince [GPE] that it is in our mutual interest to agree to significant, mutual arms reductions. And to do that, we cannot allow the current nuclear imbalance to continue. We must show the [NORP] that we are determined to spend what it takes to deter war. Once they understand that, we have a real chance of successfully reaching arms reduction agreements. [DATE] I sent to the [ORG] a proposal to modernize our intercontinental ballistic missile force. By building the MX Peacekeeper and small, single warhead missiles, we will not only preserve our ability to protect the peace, we will also demonstrate that any [NORP] quest for nuclear superiority will not work, that it is in everyone's interest to end the arms race and to agree to mutual arms reductions. There is a direct relationship between modernization programs, like the MX Peacekeeper, and the twin objectives of deterrence and arms control. The MX and other modernization measures will help us to achieve our fundamental goal, and that is to strengthen the peace by seeking arms reduction agreements that make for more security and stability by reducing overall force levels while permitting the modernization of our forces needed for a credible deterrent. I know that the paradox of peace through a credible military posture may be difficult for some people to accept. Some even argue that if we really wanted to reduce nuclear weapons we should simply stop building them ourselves. That argument makes about as much sense as saying that the way to prevent fires is to close down the fire department. It ignores one of the most basic lessons of history, a lesson that was learned by bitter experience and passed down to us by previous generations. Tyrants are tempted by weakness, and peace and freedom can only be preserved by strength.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationtheobservancearmedforcesday","title":"Radio Address to the Nation on the Observance of Armed Forces Day","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/radio-address-the-nation-the-observance-armed-forces-day","publication_date":"21-05-1983","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Ronald Reagan"],"gender":["M"]}}

Until a girl can imagine herself, can picture herself as a computer programmer or a combatant commander, she will not become one.

We will continue taking the greatest care to prevent harm to innocent civilians, yet we will not permit the spread of chaos and violence. I have directed our military commanders to make every preparation to use decisive force, if necessary, to maintain order and to protect our troops. The nation of [GPE] is moving toward self-rule, and [NORP] and [NORP] will see evidence in [DATE]. On [DATE], when the flag of free [GPE] is raised, [NORP] officials will assume full responsibility for the ministries of Government. On [DATE], the transitional administrative law, including a bill of rights that is unprecedented in the [NORP] world, will take full effect. [GPE] and all the nations of our coalition will establish normal diplomatic relations with the [NORP] Government. An [NORP] Embassy will open, and an [NORP] Ambassador will be posted. According to the schedule already approved by [ORG], [GPE] will hold elections for a national assembly no later than [DATE]. That assembly will draft a new, permanent constitution which will be presented to the [NORP] people in a national referendum held in [DATE]. [NORP] will then elect a permanent Government by [DATE], an event that will mark the completion of [GPE]'s transition from dictatorship to freedom.

And across the country, individual restaurants and chains are also focusing on our children's health -- not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it also makes sense for their bottom line. Right now, many restaurants are making a point to offer fresh produce and healthy choices aimed at kids and adults. Others are serving more low-fat dishes, whole grain breads, fruit on the side. Some are even offering kid-size portions of the meals they serve on the main menu. And chefs across the country are partnering with local schools to help them make healthy choices. But as positive as these examples are, the reality is it is just not enough. Together we have to do more. We have to go further. And we need your help to lead this effort.

It is very difficult for the President of [GPE] to condemn anybody for defending themselves. My problem with the wall was not the security aspect of the wall.

And that is an open question, but it is an experiment that the [NORP] people in all their wisdom have chosen to conduct. Are you saying their bank account affects someone's capability? Not at all. I think it -- I do not think it would actually have much of an impact at all on anybody's ability to serve the country. Why did you say it then? Mostly to be funny. And it got a couple of chuckles. Thanks for spelling that out. I guess that goes to that old adage, though, if you have to explain the joke, it was not that funny. So maybe it was not . Okay, the CR. Yes. Yes, it came out [TIME] -- [DATE], a lot of riders, but a lot of funding. Will the President sign it? Well, I can tell you that the President and his team were up [TIME] -- I do not know if the President was up [TIME] reviewing the bill, but the President's team, the experts at the [ORG] and other agencies that are trying to understand the consequences of some of the proposals that are included in the CR have been carefully analyzing that. I am not ready to render a judgment one way or the other on the proposal. But I can tell you that we continue to review the legislation and are looking at the finer points to make sure we understand exactly what impact the passage of the bill would have on funding the [GPE] government. Do you believe that we can avoid a government shutdown in [DATE]? Is there enough time to pass this CR? Well, I am certainly no expert on legislative procedure and as I have observed on many other occasions, even simple things have posed a significant challenge to this [NORP]-led [ORG], so I am not making any predictions.

Think of the remarkable work done by the [ORG] that dealt with those who were exposed to human radiation experiments [DATE] here and the work that they have done.

With women like you working with him, I do not think he could lose. In fact, I would have never started my [CARDINAL] Women in Government campaign if I had known that [PERSON] already had [CARDINAL] women on this committee, because it looks like he has the market cornered. Someone asked how it is possible for women to understand politics when they have to depend almost entirely on their husbands for political education. Until recently this same question could apply, I guess, to military science. Women could hardly be expected to know anything about the military because they had to depend almost entirely on their husbands for military education, but the world is changing and the times are changing, and so are the services. I want to thank you for your efforts. Military service is becoming an attractive career to women, and we are mighty proud that it is, because it will be a better service, be a better career. And too many people always think, I have observed, of the military in negative terms. We must quit thinking of it just as a force for destruction, or as an instrument for war. A call prompted me [DATE], when we were dealing with all the nuclear weapons and the warheads and the bombs and everything, and I thought that might be a good place to have a woman, to sit on [ORG], because they bring into the world the men who fight the wars and do the dying. So I was able to persuade Dr. [PERSON] of [PERSON] to come down and she has already been confirmed by the [ORG]. You women are going to be represented in that field as you are in the military. Now, I think it is a myth we must destroy-about force for destruction and instrument of war.

What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides.

Our notion was that we needed to rebuild a country where the foundations for people who were willing to act responsibly were there for them either to feel security in the middle class or to climb into the middle class and maybe do even better. And that means making sure that we have an education system that works, which is why we have initiated more aggressive education reform across the country than any President in a very long time and the reason that we put so much emphasis on making college more affordable for young people. It meant health care, because in a country this wealthy, we should not go bankrupt when we get sick. And the Affordable Care Act means that [CARDINAL] people will have health insurance, but it also means that people who already have health insurance have a little more security.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksobamavictoryfund2012fundraiserwestportconnecticut","title":"Remarks at an Obama Victory Fund 2012 Fundraiser in Westport, Connecticut","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-obama-victory-fund-2012-fundraiser-westport-connecticut","publication_date":"06-08-2012","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Barack Obama"],"gender":["M"]}}

And I would complain and grumble, and she would say, Well, this is no picnic for me either, buster. These are the quiet heroes. Their names do not make the history books. They are never complaining well, I will not say they are never complaining I was thinking about that for a second never hesitating to work that extra shift or that extra job if that is what it takes to give their children a better life. And in many ways, that is why we are all here [TIME], because we know that it is up to us to keep fighting for them all those women out there making sure that they are treated fairly and equally. As hard as they are working, as much as they are sacrificing, as many responsibilities that they shoulder each and every day, we have got to make sure that they are getting the opportunities that they deserve, that somebody is standing up for them. Somebody is fighting for them. Somebody is looking out for them. Somebody is rooting for them. Of course, let us be clear about [CARDINAL] thing: When we talk about these issues that primarily affect women, these are not just women's issues. When women make less than men for the same work, that hurts the entire family who has to get by with less. It hurts businesses who have fewer customers with money to spend. When a health care plan denies women coverage because of a preexisting condition, that puts a strain on emergency rooms, drives up health care costs for everybody. When any of our citizens cannot fulfill their potential because of factors that have nothing to do with their talent or their character or their work ethic, that diminishes us. It says something about who we are. Here is a fact: If you want to look around the world, those countries that are developing fastest, that are doing the best, where their children are succeeding in school, those are societies that respect the rights of women, that are investing in our women. Lifting women up lifts up our economy and lifts up our country.

We have said that if you have got a plan in the private sector that you are happy with, you have got a doctor you are happy with, you keep that person. We are not going to be messing with that. What I have said is setting up a public option that would compete with the private sector, but, if it was offering a better product, would give a additional choice to consumers, that is going to keep insurance companies honest. Now, I understand why insurance companies would not want it, because if they are making huge profits and there is no competition, then why would not they want to keep that? I understand it, I am sympathetic. But I think the average [NORP] says to themselves, `Why is it that all these members of [ORG], including all the [NORP] members of [ORG], they have essentially a public option, they essentially have the ability to look at a menu of choices and exercise those choices; why should not ordinary [NORP] have that as well?' And I think that that kind of approach is sensible. But what I have also said is let us just make sure that, you know, we are open-minded. And if, for example, the cooperative idea that [PERSON] has put forward, if that is a better way to reduce costs and help families and businesses with their health care, I am more than happy to accept those good ideas. A lot of concern about debt and deficits, as you know. Bond vigilantes people talk about, but the ordinary [NORP] people as well. That is your problem, whoever created it Yes. whether or not your health care plan adds [MONEY] to the deficit. What can you say to reassure those people who are concerned about debt that after you have finished this round of legislating on health care that you are going to do something about that; and specifically, are you open to curbing benefits for entitlement programs, more means testing and raising the retirement age?

Will not more weapons in the hands of countries that may be allies, but also have their own agendas, create the possibility of more instability over time? Well first - first of all, the - our defense support of these countries is not automatically premised on more weapons. It is premised on them being more effective with their defense budgets. So, just to give you an example, the Gulf countries, if they were coordinating their missile defense systems, would be more effective than each of them, in a siloed fashion, operating their own missile defense systems. They do not have to spend more money to get that done; they just have to do a better job integrating what they are doing. So, the notion that somehow we are going to be safer by rejecting a deal that prevents [GPE] from getting a nuclear weapon and instead leave - leaves [GPE] the option of installing more and more advanced centrifuges, shrinking their breakout time, that that somehow is going to make our neighbors more secure , I think is kind of a - well, it does not make any sense. I think what is much more likely is if we reject this deal and [GPE]'s pursuing breakout times that are shrinking because they are installing more and more advanced centrifuges and stockpiling more and more highly enriched uranium is that some of those neighbors who feel threatened by [GPE] start thinking maybe they should be pursuing their own nuclear program. And that is exactly the kinds of scenarios that we need to prevent. In those scenarios, we will then be confronted, either me or the next president, or the president after that, would be confronted with a pretty stark decision. If we do not want to see a nuclear arms race, if we are seeing [GPE] getting closer and closer to breakout capacity, and we have before the entire world rejected what every serious nuclear expert who looks at this says is a serious deal to constrain their nuclear program, then in fact that leaves one option, and that is some form of military strike.

[DATE], I announced a new [ORG] initiative that will help community colleges and employers match what is taught in the classroom with what is needed in the private sector, so we can connect students looking for jobs with businesses looking to hire. We are eliminating [MONEY] in wasteful subsidies for banks to administer student loans and using that money to make college more affordable for [CARDINAL] of students. And we have launched a Race to the Top in our [GPE] to make sure our students, all of them, are graduating from high school ready for college, so we can meet our goal of graduating a higher proportion of students from college than any other country in the world by [DATE]. And yet if [NORP] in [ORG] had their way, we'd have had a harder time meeting that goal.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsweeklyaddress68","title":"The President's Weekly Address","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/the-presidents-weekly-address-68","publication_date":"09-10-2010","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Barack Obama"],"gender":["M"]}}

[CARDINAL] of them are overseas, doing what needs to be done as no one else can, whether that means thwarting [GPE]'s ambition to threaten its neighbors or the world with weapons of mass destruction, or standing watch in [GPE] on the last fortified frontier of the cold war, or safeguarding the peace in [GPE], or helping our neighbors in Central America or the Caribbean dig out from natural disasters, or simply giving us the confidence that [GPE] will be forever strong, safe, and secure.

When we give our service men and women a mission, there is a principle we must keep in mind: We should never ask them to do what they are not equipped to do, and we should always equip them to do what we ask. The more we ask, the greater our responsibility to give our troops the support and training and equipment they need. As Commander in Chief, I have no higher duty than this: to give our troops the tools to take on new missions, while maintaining their readiness to defend our country and defeat any adversary; to make sure they can deploy away from home, knowing their families have the quality of life they deserve; and to make certain their service is not only rewarding but well rewarded, from recruitment to retirement. I am confident our military is ready to fulfill this mission [DATE]. Our troops continue to execute complex and dangerous missions far from home with flawless precision, as we have just seen in the Persian Gulf.

Undoubtedly something might be accomplished in this direction, although a very large body of such law consists in undertaking to establish rules of warfare and determining the rights of neutrals. [CARDINAL] of the difficulties to be encountered would be the necessity of securing the consent of all the nations, but no doubt the agreement of the major Powers would go very far in producing that result. I do not claim to be able to announce any formula that will guarantee the peace of the world. There are certain definite things, however, that I believe can be done, which certainly ought to be tried, that might relieve the people of the earth of much of the burden of military armaments and diminish the probability of military operations. I believe that among these are frequent international conferences suited to particular needs. [ORG] did a great deal to restore harmony and good will among the nations. Another purpose of a conference is the further limitation of competitive armaments. Much remains to be accomplished in that direction. It would appear to be impractical to attempt action under present conditions, but with a certain and definite settlement of [NORP] reparations firmly established, I should favor the calling of a similar conference to achieve such limitations of armaments and initiate plans for a codification of international law, should preliminary inquiries disclose that such a proposal would meet with a sympathetic response. But the main hope of success lies in first securing a composed state of the public mind in Europe. It is my firm belief that [GPE] is in a position to take the lead in this direction. It is undoubtedly too much to suppose that we hold very much of the affectionate regard of other nations. At the same time we do hold their respect. Our position is such that we are trusted and our business institutions and [ORG] considered to be worthy of confidence. If there is disappointment in some directions that we do not enter alliances with them, it is more than overbalanced by the knowledge that there is no danger that we shall enter alliances against them.

And part of what I think successful social movements have involved is having a certain righteous anger about injustices being done to you, but also understanding that people who are on the other side of this, they have got their own history and their own circumstances. And you have to understand that, and you have to recognize that each of us has some good and some bad in is. And that is not an excuse, but what it does do is it gives us an opportunity then to have a conversation and to reach across the divide.

I remember interviewing you in [GPE] in [DATE], and you mentioned as [CARDINAL] of your big concerns the spread of communism in this hemisphere, in the Caribbean and Central America. Well, [CARDINAL] of your most notable successes in foreign policy has been [GPE]; however, we still have [GPE], and it continues unabated. My question now is: What can you tell us that will give us confidence that the problems presented now by the [NORP] regime in [GPE] will be solved in the future? Well, I am optimistic about what is going to happen there. Right now we have a totalitarian government-the [NORP] government-in [GPE]. This came out of the revolution to overthrow the dictator, [PERSON]. But the people who are fighting as the contras against the [NORP] government now are mainly the people who were part of the revolution also against [PERSON]. They came together to overthrow that particular regime. In [DATE] those revolutionaries, including the [NORP], went to [ORG] and asked that organization to appeal to [PERSON] to step down so the killing could stop. [ORG] asked them: Well, what were the goals of their revolution?","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithguillermodescalzithespanishinternationalnetwork","title":"Interview With Guillermo Descalzi of the Spanish International Network","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-guillermo-descalzi-the-spanish-international-network","publication_date":"13-09-1985","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Ronald Reagan"],"gender":["M"]}}

[CARDINAL] point that I want to make is that in my speech in [GPE], I talked about how we need to reinvigorate a much broader agenda for nuclear nonproliferation, including [GPE] and [GPE] drawing down our stockpiles in very significant ways. To the extent that [GPE] feels that they are treated differently than everybody else that makes them embattled. To the extent that we are having a broader conversation about how all countries have an interest in containing and reducing over time the nuclear proliferation threat, that I think has to be part and parcel of our broader agenda. You are going on to Europe, to [GPE], scene of a great ally coming together. Have you convinced [NORP] leaders, do you think, taking a sort of broad look at Europe as a whole, that it is necessary sometimes to use force to get your way in the world? And I am thinking, obviously, particularly of [GPE], but almost in a wider sense, a kind of Venus and Mars issue. Are the [NORP] going to be more onboard now to the [NORP] way of thinking? Well, look, I think any student of [NORP] history understands that the devastation of not just [CARDINAL] World Wars but [DATE] of war across the Continent and across the Channel means that [NORP] understand better than anybody the costs of war, and it is legitimate and understandable that they are hesitant. I think [GPE] has a similar attitude, that we should be thinking in terms of our national defense, not where can we initiate war. We had an attack against [GPE] that killed [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [NORP]. There have been multiple terrorist attacks planned, and some successfully executed, against [NORP] states. And at some point, we have to make sure that we are eliminating those networks that would--could do our citizens harm.

I say the first [CARDINAL] because our war is not just against [CARDINAL] individuals.

I think each nation or each group of nations has to make their own national security calculations. I can just give you my perspective where [GPE] is, and you can draw whatever conclusions you want from that. I think we are dependent on oil from, in some cases, unstable parts of the world. And while you may be able to manage your way through the short term, in the long term, eventually, I think that will be a problem for national security purposes here. And therefore, when you talk about energy security, it is part-people say, Well, security is how you guarantee supply. That is one view of security. It is just that supplies can get disrupted sometimes. I view security as diversification away from a particular source of energy that may be the cause of the worry about insecurity in the first place. And so the [NORP] Government is going to have to make its decision as to whether or not it makes sense to have a supply- [CARDINAL] of its supply from a single source. I can tell you this, I have told the [NORP] people we will spend [CARDINAL] to put technology in place or achieve technological breakthroughs that will enable future [INTERVIEWED]s to say, I no longer have to worry about a single source of supply; I no longer have to worry about disruption; I no longer have to worry about politics. And I think the world needs to go there, in my own judgment. I think the whole world would be better off if we are less reliant upon forms of hydrocarbon. Is it possible? Yes, it is possible. We are spending [MONEY] on hydrogen technologies and research to determine whether or not you can actually drive your automobiles with hydrogen, a byproduct of which is nothing, water. The issue with hydrogen, however, is, [CARDINAL], obviously, the technologies. But it takes a fair amount of power to create the hydrogen. And therefore, the question is, will nations such as ours, and others, be willing to use nuclear power to be able to provide the power to create the hydrogen in the first place?

And one of the reasons why is because the [ORG] has entered into research partnerships with the private sector to accelerate these technologies, all aimed at making us less dependent on oil. A third way to help this country remain an economic leader when it comes to the cars you drive is hydrogen. We spend [MONEY] of research to bring hydrogen to the marketplace. [CARDINAL] fellow reminded me, wisely, it costs it takes quite a bit of power to make hydrogen. An interesting way to make hydrogen on an economic basis would be through nuclear power, see. But we are spending money and time and effort, all aimed at making sure that the automobiles of the future will require less crude oil. And we are close to some significant breakthroughs. It is going to take time to move away from the hydrocarbon economy to the hydrogen economy, and in the meantime, it seems like it makes sense to me to do something about the refinery capacity of [GPE]. Like, if you are worried about the price of gasoline you do not like it when your price got [MONEY] and I do not blame you you might want to ask the question, how come the Government is not working hard to expand refinery capacity so that there is more gasoline? If you have more gasoline on the market relative to demand, guess what it takes the pressure off price. We have not built a new refinery in [GPE] since [DATE]. The regulatory burden is a lot. You are kind of used to that here in this industry. And so we got to cut through all that business. If we are serious about helping our consumers and getting more gasoline to the market, we got to have regulatory relief. I suggested to [ORG] that we put new refineries on abandoned military facilities. It seemed to make sense to me. And so we need to be wise about these policies so that we can say to the [NORP] people, we are on our way out of the hydrocarbon era.

You see that all over the world. You see that here. To a certain extent, there is nothing wrong with that and it is not unhelpful. What is unhelpful is if that is used as a way to divide people and if it leads to some sort of legal or practical discrimination. And I think what Mr. [PERSON] is saying is absolutely right.

That is [CARDINAL] reason. That is not the only reason, but it is [CARDINAL] reason.

{"id":7174,"text":"I thought that was important, because we were talking around our table [CARDINAL] the welfare caseload was becoming people who were just permanently on welfare, almost, and sometimes intergenerationally. And that has nothing to do with compassion. You are not being compassionate when you leave people in a position of dependency when they do not have to be there. On the other hand, it is important, it seemed to me, when you require people who can work to work, not to ask them to hurt their children in doing it. After all, the biggest problem working families have [DATE], many working families, is balancing the demand of taking care of their kids and taking care of their job. And I hear people even with very comfortable income levels, when they are honest, say they feel conflicts between their obligations to their children and their obligations at work. And I think that it is not an exaggeration to say the most important job that any society has, ever, is raising good, strong, ethical children. That is society's most important job. So why should we expect people on welfare to sacrifice the most important job of society to do what is the most important job, arguably, in the short run to give them the self-respect and the independence they need to contribute to our common welfare? So I vetoed [CARDINAL] bills because they took away medical care and nutrition for kids and they did not give enough money for child care and because I wanted more money to put people to work in high unemployment areas. Once we resolved those things, I signed that bill. And I think it is a good thing. And the results are clear: We had the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history, [CARDINAL] fewer people on welfare than [DATE] I became [SPEAKER]. So we are moving in the right direction. The environment: The air is cleaner, the water is purer, the food supply is safer, and there are fewer toxic waste dumps. And we proved you could grow the economy and improve the environment at the same time. Now we have to prove we can do that with greenhouse gas emissions to deal with the climate change issue. And it will be tougher, but it clearly can be done clearly. There is no question, if you just look at the evidence, that we can do it. So what I want you to know is that every time you see something like that that is good, that is a product of a choice because we had a fight about all those issues.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteeluncheondenver","title":"Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Luncheon in Denver","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-democratic-national-committee-luncheon-denver","publication_date":"22-11-1997","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

Well, let me say a couple things about this. The first is that [GPE] continues to be concerned by ongoing violations of the Minsk Implementation Plan by [NORP]-backed separatists in [GPE]. We have seen repeatedly that these [NORP]-backed separatists have continued to violate the terms of the agreement despite the fact that they made firm commitments in the context of an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire. In addition to that, we have seen [NORP] military vehicles -- I am sorry -- we have seen [NORP] military personnel have participated in the recent attacks on [GPE] and [GPE]. And the [NORP] military has put in place a robust command structure in eastern [GPE]. We know this because separatist fighters have also previously acknowledged that they are operating under instructions from [GPE]. [GPE] and the separatists it backs have acted in direct contravention of the Minsk Implementation Plan that they agreed to. And we continue to call on all signatories to carry out the commitments undertaken in the plan in the September Minsk Agreements fully and without delay. The other thing that we are concerned about is that there are reports that [NORP]-backed separatists have prevented members of the [ORG] special monitoring mission from getting full access to the conflict areas. There are even some reports that indicate that those separatists have made grave threats against members of the [ORG] monitoring team. So we have seen continued behavior that is in direct violation of the agreement that [GPE] and the other parties signed [DATE].

If somebody asked me for advice, I'd say, Figure out what you believe, what is your vision of [GPE]; come up with a strategy to achieve it; then make your specific tactical move here.

It says Government gets to buy things at the cheapest, best price, and must do it. I know. I saw it; it was great. We just adopted a reform of [ORG] to reduce it by [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of people. You can apply for a small business loan now on a onepage form and get an answer in [DATE]. These are things that were unheard of before. So that is been very good. So I would say in the area of the economy, in the area of crime, in the area of reinventing the [ORG], in the area of education and training, and finally in the area of just making [ORG] work for ordinary people-we adopted the family and medical leave law, the motor voter bill to make it easier to vote, the [PERSON] bill-things that matter, we have done a very good job. For the cities-a lot of your listeners live in urban areas-we have been trying to bring free enterprise to cities. The other party talked about it all the time, but they never did much.

She said it is unbelievable. No other administration would do it. And then she likened it to kids on a playground. Your response? I really have no response to that. The last I checked, [PERSON] is not much of an expert on nuclear issues. But the strain of criticism has been out there among other [NORP] as well.

It is in our security interests that we fight global poverty, because weakened, impoverished states are attractive safe havens for terrorists and tyrants and international criminals. We believe that young people without opportunities are susceptible to ideologies of hatred. And so by helping poor nations create a more hopeful future, we can not only build prosperity; we reduce the appeal of radicalism. Our values and our interests draw us to the same conclusion: The reduction of extreme poverty in our world must be a key objective of [NORP] foreign policy. And it is. And so today I want to talk to you about the need for us to expand trade, to promote freedom, and to reform the programs that we have in place, in order to achieve results, in order to say that-to the [NORP] taxpayer, the money is not only being spent; it is being spent wisely. First, the strategy to defeat extreme poverty begins with trade. That is sometimes hard for some people to connect with. It is kind of a-people do not quite understand why that is the case. [CARDINAL] way to describe it, the value of trade, is this: The value of trade is more than 10 times the value of foreign investment and foreign aid combined. In other words, prosperity as a result of trade is more likely, [CARDINAL] times more likely, to have a positive effect on somebody living in a poor society than just investment and grants. History has shown what I am talking about. Take the example of [GPE]. It is probably hard for some to remember, back in [DATE], particularly if you were born in [DATE] [GPE] was one of the poorest nations in Asia. [GPE] reformed its economy and opened its markets to the world. And [DATE], export growth-the capacity for people to find work in [GPE], for products that are sold elsewhere-has made this country the tenth largest economy in the world. [GPE], for a long period of time, had restricted its markets. [GPE] opened its markets to global trade [DATE].

Well in fact, the [NORP] people did decide, back in [DATE] when they elected me [INTERVIEWED] with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the [NORP] would be in the majority.

There was a study I was reading, [DATE]: Overwhelming majority of the increase in income in this country went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Why is that happening on your watch? Well, it is one of my biggest concerns. And part of it has to do with the fact that these long-term trends have accelerated. Globalization, combined with technology, have stripped away a lot of the basic security that middle-income people had because a lot of those middle-income jobs have left. Either they were moved overseas, they were replaced with technology -- whether you are talking about a bank teller, a travel agent, a high-level administrator in a lot of companies, if you go to many manufacturers, it is all roboticized. So some of the -- that is part of the trend. But -- Are your efforts not helping with this? Well, there is no doubt -- The law was passed under a [NORP] [ORG]. Well, no -- there are no doubts that what we have done has helped. So for example, the changes we made in the tax law that increased taxes on the wealthiest [NORP] while locking in tax cuts for middle-class [NORP], that helped. That made the tax system more progressive. The economist [PERSON] was on our program [DATE]. He'd written a book about income inequality. And he argued, based on his analysis, that it is really inevitable, it is going to get worse, and the thing for public officials to do is to adapt to it rather than try to change it. Well, I do not accept that. [GPE] is, always been, at its best when everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to succeed. There is no doubt that these trends are powerful and they are global. I mean, we are seeing the same trends in [NORP] countries that historically were -- prided themselves on great equality.

In the current situation, what is your feeling about this? Well, first of all, I do not know all the facts about how the [NORP] democracy is handling this particular situation. I can tell you, however, from my experience, that a central bank should be independent.

And I wondered how you judge your impact in [DATE] and also what sort of legacy you hope to leave. Well, I believe that we have started government on a different course, different than anything we have done in [DATE] since [PERSON] began with the New Deal. And that is the recognition that there must be a limit to government size and power and that there has been a distortion of the relationship between the various echelons of government [ORG], [ORG], and local. And I think that we have the most to do with yet, because the higher levels of government are reluctant to give up authority once they have it. History shows that no government has ever voluntarily reduced itself in size. So, in effect, you know, we are part of government. We are trying to bring about that change. Now, this does not mean that we do not recognize government's basic responsibilities, the things it is required to do. And with all of the criticism of national defense, one of the top priorities that is listed constitutionally for [ORG] is the defense of the Nation, the national security. That prime function has been one that has been sadly neglected in [DATE]. But I think the very fact that we were successful in getting the biggest single package of budget reductions ever adopted, the single biggest package of tax reductions and ongoing that have ever been adopted, has set us on a course of trying to bring back the idea heralded by all our Founding Fathers, and reiterated so often by leaders in government. It is that government must stay within its means. And we have not achieved that yet. But by cutting the rate of growth in government more than in [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL], we are trying to bring those [CARDINAL] lines closer together the line of the normal increase in revenues that comes from the tax structure, and the growth of the country and the economy and the normal increase in government spending, which would reflect the growth in the country. Today, you have to add to that inflation has been responsible, because government's expenses go up, too, with inflation, just as the individual's do.

They do not just learn it in school, they learn it by watching us, the way we conduct ourselves, the way we treat each other. If we lie about each other, they learn it is okay to lie. If we make up facts and ignore science, then they do not -they just think it is just their opinion that matters. If they see us insulting each other like school kids, then they think, well, I guess that is how people are supposed to behave. The way we respect-or do not -this-each other as citizens will determine whether or not the hard, frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government continues. And I have got daughters that are getting older now, and one of the most important things about being a parent, I think, is them just seeing what you do not when you are out in public, not when you are dealing with somebody important, but just how do you do-how do you treat people generally. And it makes me much more mindful. I want to live up to their expectations. And in that same way, I want this democracy to live up to the people's expectations. We cannot move forward if all we do is tear each other down. And the political incentives, as they are [DATE], too often rewards that kind of behavior. That is what gets attention. So it will require some courage just to act the way our parents taught us to act. It should not , but in this political environment, apparently, it does.

The Summit of Madrid marks the first expansion of the [ORG] to the [NORP] countries. [INTERVIEWED], it is perceived by the public opinion in Europe that [GPE] limits this expansion. It is perhaps a misperception from Europe? First of all, let me say that the expansion itself is historic, and we should not minimize it. Of course, [GPE] was the last new member of [ORG], and that was an historic thing as well. But to expand [ORG] in a way that enables us to move closer to our goal of a united, democratic Europe for the first time in history is very important. I do not want to limit [ORG] expansion; I want to leave the door open to all democracies that would like to be a part of it. But keep in mind, [ORG] is not simply a political alliance. It is primarily a military alliance, and we have done a lot of work to try to adapt [ORG] to the security challenges of [DATE], to the [NORP], if you will, rather than to the cold war.

I do not want to exclude anyone, but I think it quite important on principle that we not admit anyone until we are absolutely sure that their democracy is stable and that they are militarily capable.

[INTERVIEWED], this is your [DATE] in office here. Yeah. [NORP] seem to support corporate tax reform and [NORP] seem to support it. Why is not there corporate tax reform? Your critics suggest that you have not put the presidential muscle behind this issue, certainly the way you did health care or the way you did stimulus early on in your presidency. Well, we reached out repeatedly to both [NORP] and [NORP]. And our argument is simple. If we lower corporate tax rates and close loopholes, there is going to be more certainty in terms of what corporations pay. They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance. It would allow us potentially to have companies who have profits overseas to start bringing some of those profits back and reinvesting in [GPE]. So there is a whole bunch of good reasons why we should do it. I will be honest with you [INTERVIEWER]. The reason it is not getting done right now is that [ORG], as you may have noticed, is just not real productive.

So part of the reason it is important to show up, and when I say show up, I do not just mean during election time, but to be in there engaging and listening and being with people, is because it then builds trust and it gives you a better sense of how should you talk about issues in a way that feel salient and feel meaningful to people. And I have said this before. Part of the reason I got elected twice - and part of the reason why in a lot of these communities I still have pretty strong support. It was the incredible benefit that I had in first running for [ORG] in a state that has a lot of rural communities and has a downstate that typically is suspicious of [NORP] in the city. And just sitting down in people's living rooms and [ORG] halls and at fish fries and listening to people. And then in [GPE], spending [DATE] traveling around the state and hearing people's concerns and them hearing me and getting a sense that I get it. So that even during my low points in the presidency, when, you know, poll numbers were bad and news cycle was critical, people always felt as if I still cared about them - which meant that in [DATE], I might still lose the overall vote and some of these counties or some of these voting districts, but I might lose [CARDINAL]-45 or [CARDINAL]-40 rather than [CARDINAL]. That is as a consequence of not only them seeing me in these places but it is also a consequence of me actually being there and hearing them. Were [NORP] failing to do that at every level because your party has lost the majority of races at almost every level at this point? Well, you know, I think that we have not done it as well as we need to. For example, we know that the [NORP], funded through organizations like the [PERSON] brothers, have been very systematic at...

I know the difficult problems most of you in the Southern States have had on the school desegregation problem. I went to school in the South, and so, therefore, I am more familiar with how [NORP] feel about that problem than others. Also, I went to school in the North, or the West I should say, and I have nothing but utter contempt for the double hypocritical standard of [NORP] who look at the South and point the finger and say, Why do not those [NORP] do something about their race problem?

There has been no progress in the North in [DATE] in that respect. There has been significant progress in the South. How did it come about? It came about because farsighted leaders in the South, black and white, some of whom I am sure did not agree with the opinions handed down by [ORG] which were the law of the land, recognized as law-abiding citizens that they had the responsibility to meet that law of the land, and they had dealt with the problem--not completely, there is more yet to be done. The recent decision of [ORG] presents some more problems, but I am confident that over a period of time those problems will also be handled in a peaceful and orderly way for the most part.

In light of the recent deaths of some famous athletes, I wonder what thoughts you have, whether you have made a decision? Well, remember, right now we have some participation by military, and I do not think that he was talking about making policemen out of soldiers at all. We had a task force that we set up down when [GPE] was the great entry point. And it was probably the first, most successful working together of levels of law enforcement at local, [ORG], and [ORG], and the various agencies of all of those working together, plus help from the military with radar, [ORG] things of that kind. And it was so successful that we now have [CARDINAL] of those task forces working because of the extensive borders and coastlines that we have. And we are always watching; if there are more opportunities for increasing that kind of cooperation, to deal with the problem of drugs coming into the country. Again, as I say, we want to draw the line at not saying that we are suddenly going to make our military have a police capability. But might you allow the military to use some of its assets, like radar Well, yes, and, as I say, if increasing that will help, because we already have that at work. I might also add that the military, like every other facet of our society, had its own problem with drugs internally. And they have done a magnificent job. They have virtually reduced it almost to [CARDINAL] in the military. I think what we have to face is there is a limit to what success we can have with simply trying to shut off the inflow of drugs, to take the drugs away from the users. I know that what [PERSON]'s been engaged in is, I think, what ultimately must be the answer, and that is to take the user away from the drugs, to turn the users off.

I think their best way to be esteemed in the rest of the world is to be a good citizen and give the rest of us a chance to relate to them. [GPE], [GPE]. Hello. [INTERVIEWED], I find your political opponents' relentless efforts to undermine the credibility of your administration absolutely appalling. How much does this cost the [NORP] citizen in terms of wasted time and money? And does it affect the [GPE] in the international community? Well, first I thank you for your sentiments and your support. And the most important thing of all is that the [NORP] people be able to see through it. When they see the politics of personal destruction, when they see people who obviously do not want to talk about how we are going to get this economy going or how we are going to get health care to all [NORP] or how we are going to deal with the other problems, crime in the streets, that they see it for what it is. I think that abroad, frankly, our administration and me, that I personally, that we are able to do what we need to do for [GPE]. I was very gratified at the reception that I received in Europe and in [GPE] and throughout our travels. It does take time and attention and distraction when you are dealing with all that stuff, but as I said to [INTERVIEWER] earlier, I can deal with it. The only thing that really steams me is what it does to my wife and my daughter, to my family. As a person, that bothers me. But it is not undermining our ability to go forward. Does it take time and attention, is it distracting, is it costly in that sense? You bet it is.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlarryking1","title":"Interview With Larry King","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-larry-king-1","publication_date":"20-01-1994","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Bill Clinton"],"gender":["M"]}}

While I have thought it desirable to point out dangerous tendencies, I know that with few exceptions the management of our Government has been and is in honest and competent hands, that its finances are sound and well managed, and that the business interests of the nation, including the owners, managers and employees, are representative of honorable and patriotic motives, and that the present economic condition warrants a continuation of confidence and prosperity. Fundamentally, [GPE] is sound. It has both the power and disposition to maintain itself in a healthy economic and moral condition. But it can not do this by turning all its thoughts in on itself, or by making its material prosperity its supreme choice. Selfishness is only another name for suicide. A nation that is morally dead will soon be financially dead. The progress of the world rests on courage, honor and faith. If [GPE] wishes to maintain its prosperity, it must maintain its ideals. When we turn to our foreign relations, we see the working out of the same laws. If there is one ideal of national existence to which [GPE] has adhered more consistently than to any other, it has been that of peace. Whatever other faults may be charged to our country, it has never been quarrelsome, belligerent, or bent on military aggrandisement. After all, the main support of peace is understanding. It is a matter of accurate information by [CARDINAL] government and [CARDINAL] people about other governments and other peoples. There is likewise involved the same law of service. If our country is to stand for anything in the world, if it is to represent any forward movement in human progress, these achievements will be measured in no small degree by what it is able to do for others. Up to [DATE], [GPE] gave almost its entire attention to self-development. In that it achieved an unequaled success. The service which it rendered to others was to a considerable degree one of example. It revealed the ability of the people to take charge of their own affairs.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0","title":"Address to the Annual Luncheon of the Associated Press in New York City","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/address-the-annual-luncheon-the-associated-press-new-york-city-0","publication_date":"22-04-1924","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Calvin Coolidge"],"gender":["M"]}}

I spoke with a wonderful woman, [NORP] Prime Minister [PERSON], [TIME] and relayed [GPE]'s deepest sympathy, as well as our absolute commitment to eradicating the terrorists from our planet. Radical [NORP] terrorism, it will be eradicated, believe me. America and our allies will never be intimidated. We will defend our people, our nations, and our civilization from all who dare to threaten our way of life. This includes the regime of [GPE], which has once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbors and for the entire world community. After seeing your capabilities and commitment here [DATE], I am more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming. Our thoughts also remain with those recovering in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. I visited [GPE] [DATE], where the [NORP] people have once again shown the world how resilient, strong, and truly united we are. We are going to help our fellow [NORP] put their lives, their homes, and their communities back together because when [NORP] are in need, [NORP] pull together. And we know we can always count on the courageous members of our Nation's military to be there every step of the way, just like [CARDINAL] [ORG] medical personnel who have deployed to [GPE] to help care for the sick and the injured.

First of all, I would like to welcome once again President-the President of [GPE] to [FAC], President [PERSON]. I have thanked him, and I would like to thank him once again for coming before the end of his term. No [GPE] President had visited [GPE] for [DATE] last time-the last visit we had was [DATE]. So I would like to thank him particularly. I did it earlier, and I'd like to do it formally. On behalf of all [NORP], I would like to thank him for maintaining his visit after the serious events that have taken place in his country. And I have expressed our sympathy and our affection for-to all the [NORP] people. I have also explained the-this country's situation at this time, especially from an economic standpoint. The President of [GPE] knows how the situation has evolved in our economy. He showed interest for our country's economy. When the crisis started in [DATE], [DATE], and when I was already President of the Government in [DATE], we went through very difficult times, and now we see that those times have been overcome in spite of some pending issues. [GPE] is no longer in a recession. [GPE] is growing; it is the economy which is growing fastest in the [ORG]. And jobs are no longer destroyed; jobs are being created. In [DATE], we had very positive figures, as you know. And [DATE] is also positive for the time being, and we hope things will continue like that. We have overcome imbalances. We are more competitive. And the [NORP] economy has bright prospects if it continues-we continue to have an economic policy to keep public accounts under control and if we continue to undertake structural reforms. We have also spoken about the elections in [GPE], the process that has concluded with the [DATE] elections. And I told President [PERSON] that I will do everything possible to form a Government as soon as possible.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministermarianorajoybreyspainandexchangewith","title":"Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters in Madrid, Spain","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-brey-spain-and-exchange-with","publication_date":"10-07-2016","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Barack Obama"],"gender":["M"]}}

My number [CARDINAL] priority throughout my presidency has been going after terrorist networks that would attempt to do harm to -- So what you are point? -- [NORP] inside, or outside of [GPE]. My point is that, how we do it is important, that we have to make sure that we abide by our laws. We have to make sure that we abide by our values. And we have to make sure that what we do does not end up being counterproductive. So when I hear some candidates saying we should carpet bomb innocent civilians -- [PERSON]. -- that is not a productive approach to defeating terrorism. When I hear people suggesting that we should ban all [NORP] from entering the country, that is not a good approach to defeating terrorism. Our approach has to be smart. But the pushback against this -- Uh-huh. -- when you say more people die in bathtub accidents, and I understand you are not saying it is not important, but you are saying we cannot overreact to it, is bathtub manufacturers are not trying to kill us, and they are not trying to up the body count -- I think it is fair to say that some of the sharpest criticism of you, from both sides during your presidency, has been the way that you have responded -- personally, not necessarily in policy -- to terror attacks. After [PERSON] was beheaded, you went out and played golf. After [GPE], you said it was a setback. Even as we grieve with our [NORP] friends, however, we cannot lose sight that there has been progress being made. After [GPE], you talked about gun control. Right now, people on the no fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That is insane. And some people wonder, I think the concern is, do you worry about terrorism and feel the threat of terrorism the way they do? And I would say this -- there is not a president who is taken more terrorists off the field than me, over [DATE]. I am the guy who calls the families, or meets with them, or hugs them, or tries to comfort a mom, or a dad, or a husband, or a kid, after a terrorist attack.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithchriswallacefoxnewssunday3","title":"Barack Obama Interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-chris-wallace-fox-news-sunday-3","publication_date":"10-04-2016","crawling_date":"29-06-2023","politician":["Barack Obama"],"gender":["M"]}}

[GPE]'s conventional military capacity far exceeds any [NORP] capability, and you cannot compare the [GPE] military to [GPE]. So the goal of this deal is to make sure that the [CARDINAL] real game-changer nuclear weapons is taken off the table. We now have a regional power that is good at asymmetric and unconventional and proxy aggression, and that is something that we, together, can confront and stop. This is why I had Gulf countries up to [FAC] to start coordinating more effectively to interdict arms shipments, to improve intelligence sharing, to support coordination of ballistic missile defense systems. And as soon as this debate is over, we will, I think, be able to invigorate what has been an ongoing conversation with the [NORP] about how we can do even more to enhance the unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation that we have with them, and to see, are there additional capabilities that [GPE] may be able to use to prevent [ORG], for example, from getting missiles. But I guess the point is that where [GPE] has been effective in its destabilizing activities, it is not because it is had a lot of money. It is because they have effectively used proxies; it is because they have invested in places like [GPE] for [DATE] and become entrenched. And the reason we have not done a better job of stopping that is not because they are outspending us. The reason is, is because we have not been as coordinated, had as good intelligence and been as systematic in pushing back as we need to be. So the second big issue, it seems to me, is this question of what happens in [DATE]. We know that we cannot I am sorry, before there is [CARDINAL] other point, just for context and if you want, you can splice it into the previous answer the sanctions were so effective that even with the [MONEY] And you are saying that is the [MONEY] This is [NORP] money that is currently been frozen But you have used the figure, [MONEY].

Now, most [NORP], believe it or not, do not know either one of those things, even though they may be caught up in it, and I think it is very important. Our plan is designed, number [CARDINAL], to increase the choices that consumers have. We are moving to more managed care. There can be a lot of good things in it, but under our plan, [DATE], every person would have a choice between [CARDINAL] plans, or among [CARDINAL] plans but in all probability many more. And number [CARDINAL], under our plan, medical professionals would also be given more choices and would have to do less checking in with the insurance company in advance. Now, being treated by doctors and nurses, you know, is an [NORP] tradition. Every time I do [CARDINAL] of these town meetings, like I did in [GPE] [TIME], I talk to somebody that is just been forced to give up their doctor and just move away from the choices they made. We believe when all [NORP] can choose among several health plans, many [NORP], many more [NORP], will choose to stay with their own providers. And many more of these plans will be organized in such a way that all providers can participate if they will do it for the agreed-upon fee. That is what we believe will happen. And if we do not do this, if we do not have some legal action to reorganize this, you are going to have less choice by consumers, less choice by providers. Time and again, we have also seen that the quality of care is directly related to the quality and the quantity of the nursing staff.

We have been very clear about what we expect, and that is, do not use chemical weapons, control the chemical weapons and now, because we have seen [PERSON]'s willingness to use chemical weapons, we are going to have to go further and give the international community assurances that they will not be used potentially by getting them out of there, at minimum, making sure that international control over those chemical weapons takes place. That can be accomplished and it does not solve the broader political situation.

But there have been a great many technical difficulties in running it. And then something happened. A great question arose in this country which, though complicated with legal elements, was at bottom a human question, and nothing but a question of humanity. That was the slavery question. And is it not significant that it was then, and then for the first time, that women became prominent in politics in [GPE]? Not many women; those prominent in [DATE] were so few that you can name them over in a brief catalogue, but, nevertheless, they then began to play a part in writing, not only, but in public speech, which was a very novel part for women to play in [GPE]. After the Civil War had settled some of what seemed to be the most difficult legal questions of our system, the life of the [ORG] began not only to unfold, but to accumulate.

{"id":2441,"text":"But the real problem with the sort of sequencing of interim steps is that, at least so far, because of all the other very complex forces going on there, these steps have not brought sufficient stability to the relationship and to the climate within the [NORP] areas or within [GPE] that there can be a long-term sort of set of nonpolitical measures that lead to progress-which is exactly the reverse of the [NORP] situation. And you may have heard me say this before, but the difference is, in [GPE]-I may have said this in the [ORG] speech, I cannot remember- but my physical analogy is, some unsolved problems are like scabs on a wound. If you leave them alone, they will heal. Some are like an abscessed tooth. If you leave it alone, it will get lots worse. In [GPE], because the underlying economic circumstances are dramatically improved and because there has been a dramatic increase in interpersonal contact which is positive, and because while there is a small terrorist group that is still trying to upset the [NORP] thing, it is much more contained, the absence of final resolution of the thorny political issues is unlikely to crater the situation. In the Middle East, the per capita income of most [NORP] is the same or lower than it was when we signed the agreement on [FAC], because there are so many different groups that can paralyze the process with acts of terror or violence that close the borders, that stop everything, that wreck the economy, and that kind of burn the bridges of trust that get built up when things are going okay for a year or so. I think it is more like an abscessed tooth. So that is why I decided to make the speech I gave at [ORG]. But they do not have to do that. They could reach another accommodation.

{"id":1657,"text":"[INTERVIEWER], thank you very much for being with us on Esta Maana. It is a pleasure having you. Glad to do it. Let us talk about the importance of [DATE], specifically towards the [NORP] population of [GPE]. Why should people who, many times, do not feel part of this country, and yet are citizens, why should they vote? Because there are issues at stake that will directly affect themselves, their families, their communities, and our country. There are huge differences in the economic policies of the [CARDINAL] candidates. Obviously, I favor the ones that Vice President [PERSON] and my wife and others have articulated, but there is the question of whether you think it is better to pay down the debt, have a smaller tax cut focused on the middle class, and invest more in education, or whether it is better to have a bigger tax cut, partially privatized [ORG], and have spending that will take us back in debt but give some people more money right now. That will affect everybody. How do you build on the prosperity of [DATE]? Then, there are differences of opinion on crime, on the environment, on health care, on education, and on fairness toward immigrants, which should be a big issue to the [NORP] population. I and virtually everyone in my party are fighting for the Fairness to Immigrants Act, and the leadership of [ORG] is opposing us. And so we are and we have a simple position, which is that it was right to let people from [GPE] and [GPE] come into this country if they were fleeing dictatorial or violent environments, but we owe the same thing to the people from [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and other places. So I think that is a big issue. Then there are issues revolving around whether we should have hate crimes legislation. Should we have stronger laws guaranteeing equal pay for women? All these things will drastically affect, [CARDINAL] way or the other, what life is like for ordinary [NORP]. Why do you think, sir, that the polls show that candidates really have not gotten through to all of the voters, that there is some apathy, and there is some feeling that, You know what, I do not even want to get involved with this?","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjosediazbalarttelemundonewyorkcity","title":"Interview With Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart of Telemundo in New York City","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-jose-diaz-balart-telemundo-new-york-city","publication_date":"04-11-2000","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

In your judgment, is there a timetable? Is there a ceiling that if negotiations would fail, a decision to go to war would be made? The [NORP] regime must understand that I am dedicated to the proposition that they should not continue their desire to enrich, as will be people that follow me in office. There is universal concern about [NORP] ambition here in [GPE]. This is not a party issue, an issue between [CARDINAL] party or the other. When the [NORP] President announces to the world that he is going to destroy an ally or announces to the world that he will end up defying the world-that-no matter who the President is, there is going to be a continued focus and effort to achieve this issue, to resolve this issue. This issue, before I move to [GPE], which also, a lot of [NORP] are waiting for this-is there-there are some leaking to the press, and particularly the [NORP] press-is it true that you have issued orders, [INTERVIEWED1], to your senior generals in the [NORP] military to prepare for a major and precise strike that could happen during [DATE] or [DATE]? I would call that empty propaganda. Evidently, there is a lot of gossip in parts of the country-world that try to scare people about me, personally, or my country or what we stand for. And that kind of gossip is just what it is: It is gossip; it is baseless gossip. [INTERVIEWED1], we have talked about [GPE]. And you have tried to give us a message to assure the [NORP] people-when we were in the garden together-that you do not believe in the partition or the division of [GPE].

[INTERVIEWED], I know that your most important preoccupation is the release of the hostages from [GPE]. Yes. Is there any new strategy you are working on? No, we have tried, in every way since the hostages were taken, to protect the lives and the safety of the hostages and also to protect the principles of our Nation and to secure the hostages' release. We have explored in every way, direct relationships with the [NORP] Government officials and others. Now, I think the best avenue is through a multitude of diplomatic and economic efforts, being made through [ORG] and through other countries, to convince the [NORP] that it is counterproductive for them to continue to hold these innocent people. This is an act of international terrorism, and it is condoned and supported by the official Government of [GPE].

That is why we consider a peaceful approach to [GPE], but with some economic sanctions being imposed to encourage them to act is important. In the meantime, we are pursuing every avenue-through religious leaders, through private citizens, through [ORG], and through other governments-to induce [GPE] to release the hostages so that normal relationships can be restored.

This story broke [DATE] in [ORG], and your reaction to it came on the West Coast [DATE]. And some people in [GPE] may not be caught up on it, but apparently there was a budget memo that was leaked to [ORG] indicating that [CARDINAL] of your administration's options in the future might be a reduction in [ORG] benefit COLA's and a raising of some taxes. What is the straight story on that? The straight story is that that was not an options memo for us, it was a memo which simply cataloged all the things that we might be confronted with over [DATE] by this commission on entitlements that is meeting, this bipartisan commission, as well as if the [NORP] make substantial gains in the [ORG] and try to implement their Contract With America. You know, they have made [MONEY]' worth of commitments to the [NORP] people: big tax cuts for the wealthy, and they have promised to balance the budget while cutting taxes to the wealthy and increasing defense and increasing Star Wars again. They will not say how it is going be paid for. Our calculations indicate that it would require a [PERCENT] cost cut in everything else. So you are going to have exploding deficits, [ORG] cuts, and other things if this contract goes in. This memo was simply designed to show us the kind of problems we were going to confront over [DATE] if those sort of things came up. The truth is, we are doing a good job right now in bringing the deficit down. [DATE] I am going to speak at [ORG] and talk about the deficit reduction.

{"id":4970,"text":"Congresswoman [PERSON] asked me how I knew all the names. I know a lot more about you all than you think I do. [TIME] I will be signing a proclamation to implement the terms of the registration act that the [ORG] recently passed. I would like to say at the beginning that this is a very wise decision that the [ORG] has made. And I would like to emphasize that the registration act-which has now been passed and will go into effect-is not to threaten war, but is to preserve peace. The action taken by our country and almost all other nations in the democratic world is designed to preserve peace. We are deeply concerned about the unwarranted and vicious invasion of [GPE] by [GPE] and occupation by them of this innocent and defenseless country, which is completely unwarranted. We have taken a series of steps-economic, diplomatic, political, military steps-in order to convince [GPE] that their action is ill advised and, of course, encouraging them to withdraw their troops from [GPE] and also to prevent further aggression if they should be tempted to do so. All of the action we have taken is peaceful in nature, and we will stay committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes. The freedom-fighters in [GPE], who are striving for the liberation of their country, deserve the admiration of the entire world, and their courage and persistence in fighting for freedom is the greatest single deterrent to the [NORP] aggression being successful. I would like to emphasize that the registration act is not a draft; I am not in favor of a peacetime draft. This registration act will do a great deal to marshal our own Nation's resistance to succumbing to temptation which might lead to war, and therefore lead to a mandatory draft. The only time that I envision a mandatory draft law being advocated to the [ORG] would be in time of war or in time of national emergency, and in a case of that kind, when our Nation's security is threatened, separate legal action would be required by [ORG], a separate law, to initiate a draft under those circumstances. I might say that we will continue to rely on voluntary enlistment by the military forces to defend our country.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningproclamation4771registrationunderthemilitaryselectiveserviceact","title":"Remarks on Signing Proclamation 4771 on Registration Under the Military Selective Service Act","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-signing-proclamation-4771-registration-under-the-military-selective-service-act","publication_date":"02-07-1980","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Jimmy Carter"],"gender":["M"]}}

If it is, and if it simply tries to throw roadblocks, then, yes, we take our case to the people. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], the deficit has been described as a debt that the people, the [NORP] people, owe themselves. As such, does the deficit really matter, or has the slowdown in the economy forced you to reconsider whether growth can substantially reduce the deficit? Well, of course, we had this example [DATE] in which [MONEY] came out of the deficit as it had been projected by ourselves for [DATE], and that was almost entirely due to the economic growth. But when you say the deficit and does it really matter, well, for [DATE] that is what the [NORP] have been telling us, that it did not , that we owed it to ourselves. I think to look at just the deficit ignores the real problem. The deficit is a result. What you have to get at is the problem, and that is government is spending too much, and it is spending too big a share of the private sector-that is why my opposition to those who think that the only answer to deficit spending is higher taxes. Well, we have done that in the past, and all it did was take the burden off the backs of those who wanted to spend more, so they could just go ahead and spend more. If you look at [DATE] before we came here, taxes just about doubled, and the deficit came to over something like [MONEY]. In fact, just a little while ago I was citing some figures. If you go back to [DATE]-and in [DATE] [DATE] was when [ORG] got underway-'65 to '80, in [DATE], the budget, the overall spending, increased [CARDINAL] times. The deficit increased [CARDINAL] times. So, we go back to what the classical economists used to say at [DATE], that when we had, as they put it, business cycles and hard times, it was usually when government spending crept up to above-they never told you what the percentage was, but above a certain percentage of the gross national product, took that much more money out of the private sector. That is when you had hard times.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrepresentativesthewashingtontimes","title":"Interview With Representatives of the Washington Times","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-representatives-the-washington-times","publication_date":"27-11-1984","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Ronald Reagan"],"gender":["M"]}}

[DATE], [NORP] remember the fears and uncertainty and confusion of that terrible [TIME]. But above all, we remember the resolve of our Nation to defend our freedom, rebuild a wounded city, and care for our neighbors in need. [DATE], [GPE] is confronting another disaster that has caused destruction and loss of life. This time the devastation resulted not from the malice of evil men but from the fury of water and wind. Hurricane Katrina flattened entire towns along our gulf coast and left [CARDINAL] of [GPE]'s most storied cities under water. [CARDINAL] have lost homes and loved ones and all their earthly possessions. The storm took countless lives and forced [CARDINAL] of people to flee from their communities, with no assurance of returning soon. Once more, our hearts ache for our fellow citizens, and many are left with questions about the future. Yet we are again being reminded that adversity brings out the best in the [NORP] spirit.

If I had gone to the [ORG] and actively lobbied members on a position that was contrary to the Prime Minister's position, I suspect that some eyebrows would have been raised inside of [GPE]. But the fact that there were a number of in fact, maybe the majority of [NORP] announced their opposition to the [GPE] deal before the deal was actually posted and they could read it I think indicates the degree to which sometimes politics gets involved in this.

I want to talk about energy, see. If we do not get it right in energy, we can have the most educated workforce in the world, but we are not going to be able to compete. We can have the lowest taxes in the world, the least regulations, the fewest lawsuits, but if we have not done something about our energy situation, we are not going to be able to compete in the world.

Is not that interesting statistics? In other words, we are becoming more technologically advanced. And during that same period of time, we created [CARDINAL] jobs while cutting air pollution by [PERCENT]. So what I believe the [NORP] people should understand is that we can put policies in place that encourage economic growth so you have got a better standard of living and, at the same time, become less dependent on energy from overseas and protect the environment. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing we got to do is understand that we have got to change our driving habits over time. You have seen the price of gasoline going up. [CARDINAL] of the reasons why your price of gasoline is going up is because demand for oil is increasing in places like [GPE] and [GPE], and the supply for oil is not meeting that demand. And the key ingredient for gasoline is crude oil. So when the [NORP] economy is growing or the [NORP] economy is growing, and that demand is going up, so is your price at the pump.

That is tragic, and we cannot let it happen again. It is interesting.

And they said, If you put [CARDINAL] police on the streets it would not make a lick of difference just as sort of a boondoggle. They attacked us for being for after-school programs for kids and preventive programs to keep kids out of trouble in the first place. But our crime bill was basically written out of the experience of police officers and prosecutors and community leaders who were in communities where they were already lowering the crime rate by doing what was in our bill. So we passed the bill with [CARDINAL], 000 police officers and with tougher punishment where appropriate, but with prevention measures and with the assault weapons ban.

And that happened because of a political choice the [NORP] people made, and they knew how to make it in part because they heard the messages of the competing candidates. There is a direct connection between your presence here and that decision. And we had a huge fight about it. In welfare, the same thing is true.

And I have another thought. This is a great industrial center. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at [GPE] as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is [CARDINAL] reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold.

We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations.

I am willing to take on the rising costs of health care programs like [ORG] and [ORG] to make sure they are strong and secure for future generations. But we cannot just close our deficits by cutting spending. That is the truth, and [NORP] understand that. Because if all we all do is cut, then seniors will have to pay a lot more for their health care, and students will have to pay a lot more for college, and workers who get laid off might not have any temporary assistance or job training to get them back on their feet. And with gas prices this high, we'd have to stop much of the clean energy research that will help us free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil. Not only is it not fair if all of this is done on the backs of middle class families and poor families, it does not make sense. It may sound good to save a lot of money over [DATE], but not if we sacrifice our future for [DATE]. And that is why people from both parties have said that the best way to take on our deficit is with a balanced approach, one where the wealthiest [NORP] and big corporations pay their fair share too. Before we stop funding energy research, we should ask oil companies and corporate jet owners to give up special tax breaks that other folks do not get. Before we ask college students to pay more to go to college, we should ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes that are lower in their--in terms of rates than their secretaries. Before we ask seniors to pay more for [ORG], we should ask people like me to give up tax breaks that we do not need and were not even asking for.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalcouncillaraza0","title":"Remarks to the National Council of La Raza","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-the-national-council-la-raza-0","publication_date":"25-07-2011","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Barack Obama"],"gender":["M"]}}

No property is more private, no property is more personal, even intimate, than an individual's income. It directly represents the labor, day-in and day-out, of one's mind and hands. It is used for the necessities of life itself, to provide for one's family, to make possible the adventure of building a better life. Yet during [DATE], [ORG] showed a high-handed disregard for this most fundamental form of property, taxing it at higher and higher levels, permitting inflation to raise effective tax rates again and again. Well, our administration changed all that. We cut tax rates, indexed tax brackets, then simplified the entire tax system with our historic tax reform. And the result? The connection between effort and reward was reestablished, giving virtually every participant in our economy new incentives for achievement. [DATE] unemployment stands at the lowest rate in [DATE]. Government revenues at the [ORG] level and for most State and local governments have actually gone up. The stock and bond markets have risen to record highs.

In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on [FAC] accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists.

Meanwhile, new developments in technology have created new concerns--the cruise missile, the very large intercontinental ballistic missiles of the [NORP].

And then they translated those understandings into concrete commitments, not just an election. An election is only part of it, although a big part. I think the decision to go for a government of national unity for [DATE] is absolutely critical to this and making the decision before you know the outcome of the election. The decision to have a bill of rights, the decision to have a constitutional court, I think all these things have made a huge difference.

There is a couple ways of approaching this. [CARDINAL] is individual countries and [CARDINAL] is [ORG]. With respect to individual countries, we will be able to have conversations on the margins of this summit as the President did with Prime Minister [PERSON] about contributions that they can make on an ongoing basis to an effort to confront [ORG]. A number of [ORG] members have already stepped up -- countries like [GPE] and [GPE], as well as [GPE], [GPE] -- in things like supporting the [NORP] and the [ORG] with arms and equipment.

For us, therefore, it has been a matter of necessity to be a partner with you in [ORG], and it is also been a fulfillment of what to us has been in the past, and still is, a moral obligation. We learned, during [CARDINAL] great wars in [DATE], some profound and unforgettable lessons: that through strength can come peace, and that in awareness of a common resolution among free men and women there can be a conviction of potential adversaries that is better for mutual respect and the preservation of peace. We want a strong defense. We have assured that. We want a general commitment to peace and mutual disarmament. And both those elements of our desires can be guaranteed only through the accurate image of a capable and deep commitment to mutual strength.

What would you want to accomplish in that second term? Well, let us start out with the situation as of [DATE]: skyrocketing interest rates, higher than they have been in [DATE]; inflation in double digits; a continued decline in business; and a continued increase in unemployment. And [DATE] we are in the midst of a recovery. While the interest rates are still too high, they are [CARDINAL] of what they were. We have returned to economic growth without inflation.

Say all the allies get on board and- We believe that there could be a [GPE] force which we could take part in that could help to enforce the peace agreement or keep the peace. We have been involved in peacekeeping operations of this kind in many places. But [GPE] is not going to unilaterally enter the conflict on the side of [CARDINAL] of the combatants and do what we did in [GPE]. That is not our policy, and that is not what we are going to do. You know, I agreed with you when you said during the campaign that history has shown that you cannot , allow the mass extermination of people and just sit by and watch it happen, and that re, ally is driving this, is not it? Yes. It is a difficult issue. Let me say that when we have people here who've been involved in many previous administrations that are involved in national security including, obviously, a lot of people who were involved in the [CARDINAL] previous ones-everybody I talk to believes that this is the toughest foreign policy problem our country has faced in a long time. And I am trying to proceed in a very deliberate way to try to make sure there is not a [GPE] problem here. But, also to try to make sure that [GPE] keeps pushing to save lives and to confine the conflict. I do not think we can just turn away from this. Just because we do not want to make the mistake we did in [GPE] does not mean we should not be doing anything. There are things that we can do, and we are trying to do more to try to push this thing toward a settlement. I, also think that in terms of our clear self-interest, in addition to the humanitarian issue, if we can stop this conflict from spreading, and it has powder-keg potential, that that is clearly in our interest.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdonimuswfanradionewyorkcity","title":"Interview With Don Imus of WFAN Radio, New York City","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-don-imus-wfan-radio-new-york-city","publication_date":"12-05-1993","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

That is why [DATE] I worked with the [ORG] and we launched this nationwide effort to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco by reducing youth access to tobacco products, by preventing companies from advertising to our children. The purpose of the [ORG] rule was to reduce youth smoking by [PERCENT] within [DATE]. [DATE], a [ORG] judge in [GPE] said that the [ORG] has the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect the health of our children. There have also been other examples of litigation progress, as you know, brought by private plaintiffs and by the attorneys general. Now, these victories for public health drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table. They extracted concessions that would have been literally unthinkable just a short time ago.

That is [CARDINAL] thing I think the [PERSON] administration will be in a position to do, because of the development of our relationships, I will be-I expect that President [PERSON] and then-President [PERSON] will be successful in continuing to reduce the nuclear arsenals. But you do not want to have all this sort of uncontrolled instability in some other part of the world.

Philosophically, he had an idea of making it available to all countries so that no one would be any more at risk, including from us. But that technology is not out there now. We are talking about technology to stop the accidental launch or a terrorist or a country with [CARDINAL] or three missiles that could lob them at you.

So they reallyI think [DATE], when they look back, they will see that they did not bring an end to an era of slaughter the way the World War II generation did, with heroism and great sacrifice, but they did put [GPE]'s military might to work in building a new world, which is something that I think their children and grandchildren will be very, very proud of.

The [NORP] dominated countries are maintaining large military forces-far larger than they could possibly need for peaceful purposes. And they have shown by their actions in [GPE] that they will not hesitate to use these forces in armed aggression whenever it suits their evil purposes. Because of this military threat, we must strengthen our military defenses. We are now engaged in a great program of rearmament. This will change the lives of our young people. A great many of them will have to devote some part of their lives to service in our [ORG] or other defense activities. In no other way can we insure our survival as a nation. Our objective is not simply to build up our own [ORG]. Our objective is to help build up the collective strength of the free nations the nations which share the ideals and aspirations of free men everywhere. As a matter of defense, we need the combined resources and the common determination of the free world to meet the military threat of communism. But our problem is more than a military matter. Our problem and our objective is to build a world order based on freedom and justice. We have worked with the free nations to lay the foundations of such a world order in [ORG]. We must remain firm in our commitment to [ORG]. That is the only way out of an endless circle of force and retaliation, violence and war which will carry the human race back to [DATE] if it is not stopped now. And this is a point that we must make sure our children and young people understand. The threat of communism has other aspects than the military aspect. In some ways the moral and spiritual dangers that flow from communism are a much more serious threat to freedom than are its military power. The ideology of communism is a challenge to all the values of our society and of our way of life. Some people are most concerned about the [NORP] threat to our economic system. But, serious as this is, it is [CARDINAL] of the many problems that communism raises. Communism attacks our main basic values, our belief in God, our belief in the dignity of man and the value of human life, our belief in justice and freedom. It attacks the institutions that are based on these values. It attacks our churches, our guarantees of civil liberty, our courts, our democratic form of government.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbeforethemidcenturywhitehouseconferencechildrenandyouth","title":"Address Before the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth.","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/address-before-the-midcentury-white-house-conference-children-and-youth","publication_date":"05-12-1950","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Harry S.

And let us be clear: None of this is necessary. It is happening because a choice that [NORP] in [ORG] have made. They have allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit. As recently as [DATE], they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well off and well connected, and they think that that is apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts. I do believe that we can and must replace these cuts with a more balanced approach that asks something from everybody: smart spending cuts, entitlement reform, tax reform that makes [ORG] more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates-all so that we can responsibly lower the deficit without laying off workers or forcing parents to scramble for childcare or slashing financial aid for college students. I do not think that is too much to ask. I do not think that is partisan. It is the kind of approach that I have proposed for [DATE]. It is what I ran on [DATE]. The majority of the [NORP] people agree with me in this approach, including, by the way, a majority of [NORP]. We just need [NORP] in [ORG] to catch up with their own party and their country on this. And if they did so, we could make a lot of progress. I do know that there are [NORP] in [ORG] who privately, at least, say that they would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through. I know that there are [NORP] who'd rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts go through. So there is a caucus of common sense up on [ORG].

We have a comprehensive health care reform plan that will help us keep the quality health care. Make no mistake about it, people are still pouring into [GPE] for specialized care because they know we have the best quality health care in the entire world. So we want to keep the quality health care that makes us first in the world and at the same time open up access to all [NORP]. Contrary to what the big Government folks say, we can do it without putting the Government in charge of everybody's health care. If you want to stand in line, you can go to [ORG]. You do not need to go for a nationalized health care program. Let us face it, national health care, in my view, literally would be a costly national disaster, and I am not going to let that happen. We are going to fight for our plan of reform that gives access to insurance to the poor and the middle-income people alike. That is what we need, and that is what I believe we will be able to get when we take this case to the [NORP] people. So far, I have spoken a little bit about what Government can do. So let me conclude by speaking about what society absolutely must do. Because there is something society must cultivate that [ORG] cannot provide, something we cannot legislate, something that we cannot make happen by [ORG] order. I am talking about the moral sense that guides us all. In the simplest of terms -- you want to get it to fundamentals -- I am talking about knowing right from wrong and then doing what is right. You go back to [GPE] for [TIME]. Time and again the people I met with there put their finger on one root cause for the turmoil we see, and that, of course, back to the point, the dissolution of the family. And they are right. They are absolutely right. And ask yourself: What is the determining fact right now for whether a child has hope, stays in school, stays away from drugs? It is not Government spending.

[ORG], which [PERSON] has led so ably, has proven that over and over again. The media has donated [MONEY] in support of partnership antidrug messages on television and radio, in print and outdoor billboards.

[PERSON] was in [GPE]. [PERSON], the man who is inflicting so much murder and chaos on innocent [NORP], was in [GPE]. [PERSON] was an enemy of [GPE], enemy of a lot of countries.

And there is no doubt in my mind that a democratic [GPE] will be a part of a change in the broader Middle East that will lay the foundations for peace. You know, a lot of the world says, Well, unless you are a certain type of person, you cannot live in a free society. I strongly disagree with that. I believe that embedded into everybody's soul is the desire to live in freedom. That is what I believe, that there is an Almighty, and the Almighty plants a sense of being free. Therefore, if given a chance, people will live in a free society, and free societies are peaceful societies. Any plans to visit in the State of [GPE]? I know you were there as a Governor of [GPE].

All I can tell you is, we have a higher percentage of people in jail than all the other advanced countries, and they have a lower gun death rate. Why is that? That is because they do not have an [ORG] in their country, and they take sensible steps to protect children and society as a whole from people having guns who should not have them, doing things they should not do with them. You have got to keep guns away from criminals and children if you want a safe society.

Why should we burden them with having to go through and empty their pockets and take out their money clips and all that because there is just a few criminals around? And you know, you are interfering with their individual rights to walk on an airplane. That is the argument they make. You should not burden an individual law-abiding handgun owner, because most of them are lawful, just because there are a few criminals.

{"id":3953,"text":"[INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]: [INTERVIEWED], down here you are talking about budget cutting in [GPE]; that means [CARDINAL] things basically, the [ORG] and the space station. How do you see their future? Are they going to hang in there? And if push comes to shove, how would you put them in priority of importance if you have to keep one and get rid of one? Well, let me just say this. They are both very important to me for different reasons. And I think they are both important to the country. I think, if you are asking how they are doing now, I think the space station is more secure than the super collider, because the space station passed a [ORG] vote. It was a narrow vote, as you probably know, the first time. The second time we got some more votes. But the first time we only carried it by a couple of votes when [CARDINAL] good friends of mine who went down to vote against it stayed to the end and changed their vote so we could save it because they knew it was important to me and, I think, to the country, as I said . So we have redesigned the space station after a serious review by an eminent team of national scientists. It is very important to maintain our leadership in space technology. It is very important in terms of new partnerships with [GPE] to keep them involved in this kind of technology, to reduce the incentive they have to sell weapons and keep them taking their nuclear force down. But most important, it is a big economic boom to us. If we get out of this, the [NORP] will move right in, take this over, and have a lot of those high-wage jobs that [NORP] should have. So I think it is critically important. The super collider is important, in my judgment, for science and for research, not so much for applied technology now. We do not know for sure what it will produce, but we know that it has the potential to produce a great deal, and we know that other major science research projects like this have often had unintended benefits. It is in more trouble now. And frankly, whether we can save it or not depends entirely on whether we can save it in the [ORG].

They do not even remember what it was like [DATE]. There has been improvement. The question is what more do we need to do, and what is clear, when you look at some of the reports that have occurred around the country, is that not only is there still a lot of spicion and mistrt between police officers and communities of color. But what is also true is that there are still instances in which a young black boy or brown boy is not being evaluated, in terms of risk, precisely in the same way as a white young person might be by the police. Now, that can be solved through better training, better accountability, better transparency, and so the task force we have put together is designed to do precisely this. But I think it is important to realize that even as we ph to get on top of these issues around the country, and nobody's going to be phing harder than me becae I have been subjected to these kinds of misperceptions in the past, that You have been discriminated?

Freedom is also the basis for a democratic system of government, which is the only fair and just ordering of society and the only way to guarantee the God-given rights of all people. Democracies do not take the same shape. They develop at different speeds and in different ways, and they reflect the unique cultures and traditions of their people.

The truth is that freedom is a universal right, the Almighty's gift to every man, woman, and child on the face of the Earth.

So that is on the restaurant side. Let me just briefly make this point. There is a concern around access to food for those that cannot prepare their own food.

Let me give you [CARDINAL] of many stirring examples. [PERSON], of [GPE], [GPE], has raised [MONEY] for the statue by going door to door with an appeal to help Miss [PERSON]. Well, I am proud to be in [PERSON]'s company here in [FAC] [DATE]. And then, there is [PERSON], of [GPE], [GPE], who brought a jar of [MONEY] into her first-grade class to help raise money for the Statue of Liberty. The pennies had been collected [DATE] by [PERSON]'s mother, who, day by day, put one into a jar to mark the time that her fianc was in [GPE]. And now, after all these years, they felt it was only appropriate to give these special coins to Lady Liberty, who symbolizes what [PERSON]'s dad fought for freedom.","label":"monologic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthebilldesignatingthecentennialyearlibertytheunitedstates","title":"Remarks on Signing the Bill Designating the Centennial Year of Liberty in the United States","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/remarks-signing-the-bill-designating-the-centennial-year-liberty-the-united-states","publication_date":"28-10-1985","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Ronald Reagan"],"gender":["M"]}}
{"id":26,"text":"There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into [DATE] and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the [NORP] people. I believe we are going to get a lot done too. My concern for [GPE] is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. It is easy to say: Well, the competition is too tough; let us just not trade. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for [GPE]. I would hope that [DATE] [GPE] still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my [NORP] friend Prime Minister [PERSON], now Prime Minister [PERSON], [PERSON], a good guy. Is not it interesting that the [GPE] President sits at the table with the [NORP] Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Same thing can happen if [GPE] stays engaged and helps societies become free societies. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in [GPE], in many ways. We are allies; [PERSON] and I are very close. I would hope [GPE] would never lose sight of that capacity. And the other question? About [GPE], political-- Oh, the energy, yes. Here is the thing: You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. And, therefore, our strategy is to diversify. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7","title":"Interview With Foreign Print Journalists","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7","publication_date":"31-05-2007","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["George W.

{"id":1885,"text":"But you know, I could give you a lot of examples [DATE] there was a widely reported story that I kept airplane traffic waiting [TIME] in [GPE] to get a haircut in an airport. That was not true either. It was not true at the time. And I told the press it was not true. They ran the story anyway. Then [DATE] when the [ORG] filed their official report, they said, No, there were no planes kept waiting. Now, I am not responsible for stories that are written that are not fully accurate or untrue, but it feeds into this cynicism. [DATE] the [ORG] and the President, according to all nonpartisan reports, had the most productive [DATE] working together, getting things done for [GPE], dealing with difficult issues, of [DATE] of a President since the end of World War II, except [PERSON] [DATE] and President [PERSON]'s [DATE], which were about the same. And to be frank, we did it under more difficult circumstances, with tougher issues. I will bet you nobody in [GPE] knows that. Now, that is not entirely our fault. Look at all the things you could have asked me about, and you just asked me that. Did you know that there were other people on that aircraft carrier? Did you know there were press people on the aircraft carrier? Did you know that the carrier had been fully reimbursed out of the private pocket of a [ORG] staff member who was so upset about it? No, I did not know that [ORG] No. No. Why did not you know that? Because the press reporting it did not say so. Yes. I mean, part of the problem in this country [DATE] is that this is a good country with a lot of people working hard to get things done. And the [NORP] people are entitled to have some balanced and fair picture of what is going on. We have had [CARDINAL] new jobs come into this economy since I have been [INTERVIEWED], far more than in [DATE] combined. Most [NORP] do not even know it, because that is not the purpose of a lot of what is communicated to them. And I think that I have a very high responsibility.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithkevinhorriganandcharlesbrennankmoxradiostlouismissouri","title":"Interview With Kevin Horrigan and Charles Brennan of KMOX Radio, St. Louis, Missouri","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-kevin-horrigan-and-charles-brennan-kmox-radio-st-louis-missouri","publication_date":"24-06-1994","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

{"id":2263,"text":"There are a number of poor people and single mothers in our listening audience who feel demonized when the subject of welfare reform comes up, because it appears as though they are being stereotyped in terms of not wanting to work, not wanting to find a job, et cetera, when it has been the experience of many people in our community that this is not the case, that many people on public assistance want desperately to find jobs. Tell us how your welfare reform program would speak to this seeming demonization of single mothers and the poor. Well, first of all, let me say I agree with what you just said. [CARDINAL] of the things that I try to say every time I mention this issue is that the people who most want relief from welfare dependency are the people who are on welfare. I have spent probably more time with people who are actually on public assistance rolls who are mostly, as you know, young women and their children than any President ever has, because I served [DATE] as a Governor and I did a lot of work on welfare reform. What our program would do is to, first of all, try to do more to empower people to move from welfare to work through adequate education and training and health care and child care for the children of welfare recipients, so they can facilitate their move into the workplace. We also have lowered taxes on workers with children who work full-time for very modest wages so they will not be falling back into poverty, there will not be an incentive to go back on welfare if they get a job. Now, the trick is going to be how to create enough jobs for people to get them. That is, once you train people for work and once you say that after [DATE] they have to go to work if they are not, then there have to be jobs there available. And there are [CARDINAL] options: You either have to have some sort of incentive for the private sector to hire more people, or people have to go to work in public jobs, community service jobs. And we are working on both. I just approved I have approved [CARDINAL] experiments in [CARDINAL] separate [GPE] to try things to put people from welfare to work. And [GPE] has just gotten permission from our administration to actually give welfare checks to private employers as a supplement, and then the employer puts in some pay over and above that.","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkrileyandlaurablackburnewlibradionewyorkcity","title":"Interview With Mark Riley and Laura Blackburne of WLIB Radio, New York City","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-mark-riley-and-laura-blackburne-wlib-radio-new-york-city","publication_date":"18-10-1994","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["William J.

{"id":2601,"text":"Do we want a society in which we have still got, you know, the best science and the best research in the world, and the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world? Or do we think that an economy in which you are on your own and big corporations can write their own rules and we are gutting regulations... Which one is more likely to help middle-class families and people trying to get in the middle class? And that is the question that people are gonna be presented with. And I welcome that debate. I think it is a healthy debate for the country to have. And I think it is a debate we can win. Because I am absolutely convinced that the vision I am presenting is one that is true to the history of this country. And that is part of what I was talking about in this [GPE] speech. It is true to the notion that we rise or fall together. And that, you know, when we are firing on all cylinders, because the guy on the factory floor and the guy on the executive suite are both doing well and they are both focused on making great [NORP] products and providing great [NORP] services and exporting around the world... That is the recipe for success that I think the [NORP] people are hungry for. It is just, right now, they have not seen enough of it yet. You definitely have some impressive accomplishments. Thank you, [INTERVIEWER]. No, you do. And more than a lot of presidents who manage to get reelected. My question is, is it enough? Why do you think you deserve to be reelected? I think under some extraordinary circumstances, we not only saved the country from a potential disaster -- not only did we manage our national security at a time where there were severe threats and [CARDINAL] wars going on, in a way that has made [GPE] stronger and more respected and put us in a better strategic position around the world and almost decimated our number [CARDINAL] enemy, which is [ORG] -- but what I have also been able to do is to, in very practical ways, put in place a series of steps that will allow middle-class families and those trying to get in the middle class to take back some of what they have lost over [DATE].","label":"dialogic","metadata":{"text_id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevekroftcbsnews60minutes1","title":"Interview with Steve Kroft on CBS News \"60 Minutes\"","source":"https:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/documents\/interview-with-steve-kroft-cbs-news-60-minutes-1","publication_date":"09-12-2011","crawling_date":"10-09-2023","politician":["Barack Obama"],"gender":["M"]}}
