And then came DATE, when CARDINAL men from the Middle East carried out the worst attack on GPE since the strike on FAC DATE this weekend. In the space of TIME, 9/11 etched a sharp dividing line in our history. We realized that we are in a struggle with fanatics pledged to our destruction. We saw that conditions of repression and despair on the other side of the world could bring suffering and death to our own streets. With these new realities in mind, GPE reshaped our approach to the Middle East. We made clear that we will defend our friends, our interests, and our people against any hostile attempt to dominate the Middle East, whether by terror, blackmail, or the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. We have carried out this new strategy by following CARDINAL overriding principles. First, we took the offense against the terrorists overseas. We are waging a relentless campaign to break up extremist networks and deny them safe havens. As part of that offensive, we pledged to strengthen our partnership with every nation that joins in the fight against terror. We deepened our security cooperation with allies like GPE and GPE, and with our friends in the gulf. GPE, long a breeding ground for radicalism, has become a determined partner in the fight against terror, killing or capturing CARDINAL of ORG operatives in the GPE. We dramatically expanded counterterrorism ties with partners in North Africa. And we left no doubt that GPE would stand by our closest ally in the Middle East, GPE. Second, we made clear that hostile regimes must end their support for terror and their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, or face the concerted opposition of the world. This was the approach we took in GPE. It is true, as I have said many times, that PERSON was not connected to the 9/11 attacks.

It was clear to me it was clear to members of both political parties and to many leaders around the world that after 9/11, that was a risk we could not afford to take. So we went back to ORG, which unanimously passed Resolution 1441 calling on PERSON to disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. With this resolution, we offered PERSON a final chance to comply with the demands of the world. And when he refused to resolve the issue peacefully, we acted with a coalition of nations to protect our people and liberated CARDINAL NORP. When PERSON regimes fell when PERSON's regime fell, we refused to take the easy option and install a friendly strongman in his place. Even though it required enormous sacrifice, we stood by the NORP people as they elected their own leaders and built a young democracy. When the violence reached its most dire point, pressure to withdraw reached its height. Yet failure in GPE would have unleashed chaos, widened the violence, and allowed the terrorists to gain a new safe haven, a fundamental contradiction to our vision for the Middle East. So we adopted a new strategy and deployed more troops to secure the NORP people. When the surge met its objective, we began to bring our troops home under the policy of return on success. DATE, building on the gains made by the surge, the democratic ORG approved CARDINAL agreements with GPE that formalize our diplomatic, economic, and security ties and set a framework for the drawdown of NORP forces as the fight in GPE nears its successful end. After 9/11, we also confronted GPE over its weapons of mass destruction. The leader of GPE made a wise choice. In DATE, Colonel PERSON announced that he would abandon his weapons of mass destruction program. He concluded that the interests of his people would be best served by improving relations with GPE, and GPE turned over its nuclear centrifuges and other deadly equipment to GPE.

Sadly, after the election of President PERSON, GPE reversed course and announced it would begin enriching again. Since then, we have imposed tough sanctions through ORG resolutions. We and our partners have offered GPE diplomatic and economic incentives to suspend enrichment. We have promised to support a peaceful civilian nuclear program.

We are engaged in a battle with the extremists that is broader than a military conflict and broader than a law enforcement operation. We are engaged in an ideological struggle.

We stand on what we have said on the subject of human rights. the positive and sincere expression of our deepest beliefs as a people. It is addressed not to any particular people or area of the world, but to all countries equally, yes, including our own country. And it is specifically not designed to heat up the arms race or bring back the cold war. On the contrary, I believe that an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation is far more conducive to an increased respect for human rights than an atmosphere of belligerence or hatred or warlike confrontation. The experience of our own country DATE has proved this over and over again. We have no illusions that the process will be quick or that change will come easily. But we are confident that if we do not abandon the struggle, the cause of personal freedom and human dignity will be enhanced in all nations of the world. We are going to do that. In DATE we have made clear our determination--both to give voice to NORP' fundamental beliefs and to obtain lasting solutions to East-West differences. If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our choice. We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship will evolve in a more constructive direction. But there are things which give me hope, and in conclusion I would like to mention them very briefly.

If I lost by CARDINAL and we found out that there were CARDINAL dead people, okay. There were CARDINAL of dead people that voted in different states, CARDINAL and CARDINAL. Some even applied for an application to vote. Do you believe that? So not only did they vote, they applied for an application, but if had CARDINAL dead people and we lost by CARDINAL, I do not consider that. CARDINAL mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent. Other than that, it was very good. The county has refused to disclose how many of these CARDINAL were in person, early votes. And how many were magically appearing in a mail-in ballot box near you? How about those boxes where they were coming in and PERSON was getting PERCENT of the vote? In all fairness, we'd come. We came for rallies here. We had CARDINAL and CARDINAL and he came and he could not fill the CARDINAL circles. They had to use the fake news. No, they were calling the news. They are standing with cameras. They could not fill the CARDINAL circles. The only thing I liked about his campaign, because he did not really campaign, the cabal campaign. Lots of people campaigned for him.

First, let me say our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are necessary to protect GPE's farmers from excessive losses during this drought. Already we have taken a number of actions. We have formed an interagency drought policy committee to coordinate ORG action. ORG is working hard to keep traffic moving on the Mississippi River and elsewhere in spite of some of the lowest water levels in history. And in order to help livestock owners, Secretary PERSON has permitted grazing on set-aside lands. And now is the time to start work on legislation to help the many crop farmers who will suffer substantial losses. At my direction, Secretary PERSON has been working closely with the leadership of the ORG and ORG ORG in an effort to draft timely legislation. We have sought to make this a bipartisan effort, and so far I am pleased by the cooperation that we have received. Permit me to outline the CARDINAL points we are seeking in this drought legislation. First, relief should go to those who need it most. Second, many of our farmers purchased Federal crop insurance, a sound business decision. They should not be penalized relative to farmers who-did not act with such prudence. Third, this legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable things. No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops. Fourth, drought relief spending has to be considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the ORG deficit; and according to the DATE bipartisan budget agreement that we reached with ORG, to put it very simply, we mustn't bust the budget. The automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending triggers would take back from farmers with CARDINAL hand what we are providing in drought relief with the other.

The solution to the world agricultural problem is to get government out of the way and let farmers compete. It is true, of course, that getting rid of all export subsidies, import barriers, and the like-all the things that make it harder for our farmers to compete in world markets-is a very tall order; but we are not backing down.

{"id": 5159, "text": "The more of these foods people eat, the more they are accustomed to that taste, and after a while, those unhealthy foods become a permanent part of their eating habits. It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And DATE, no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is NORP, NORP, NORP, NORP -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. CARDINAL local survey found that PERCENT of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; PERCENT includes chicken fingers; CARDINAL includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over 1,000 calories, and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for DATE. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just CARDINAL token healthy option on the menu, or taking out CARDINAL problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime. This philosophy also needs to apply to the rest of the food that you offer, because just as we eat out as a family, we also should be able to eat well as a family.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}

I am not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love. That could mean substituting wheat pasta for white pasta in your regular recipes, or taking out an existing -- taking an existing dish and cutting the amount of butter or cream -- not enough to sacrifice flavor -- we all like flavor -- but just enough to make a meaningful difference in the amount of calories and fat. It could mean serving PERCENT or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request -- which would hurt me deeply. And no matter what you do, it is also important, truly important, to keep portion sizes in check, because we all know that the size of a meal is just as important as the ingredients it is made of. But your role in helping address childhood obesity is not limited to what you put on your menus and how you label them for parents. It is also about how you market those products to our kids. Our kids do not learn about the latest fast-food creations on their own. They hear about them on TV, advertisements, in the Internet, video games, and many other places. As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids. A study DATE found that only a small percentage of advertising aimed at kids promoted healthy foods, while most promoted foods with a low nutritional value. It is not enough just to limit ads for foods that are not healthy. It is also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy. And if there is anyone who can sell healthy food to our kids, it is all of you, because you know what gets their attention. You know what makes a lasting impression.

Again, I know many of you have said that you would offer and promote healthy options in a heartbeat if they were as popular as the healthy -- unhealthy options, because that is how business works, and I understand that. But I have yet to meet a single parent who does not understand the threat of childhood obesity. I have yet to meet a single parent who is not eager to buy healthier products. They just need more information. They need easier access to those products. And I have heard from more companies over DATE that the market is starting to move in a healthier direction. Folks are beginning to ask for more fruits and vegetables and for smaller portions. So when it comes right down to it, this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again. That is why we are committed to helping increase that demand and making it easier for you to do what is right. And we have started by requiring chain restaurants to provide calorie counts on their menus and menu boards. And I am grateful for the support we have received from the ORG to get this done. And I want to encourage restaurants that are not providing calorie counts to join us in this effort. And because so many of the calories our kids consume come from school, we are also working to get more nutritious food into our lunchrooms and our vending machines.

As part of Let us Move, we are setting a goal of doubling the number of schools that participate in the Healthier US Schools Challenge by DATE.

So I hope that all of you will join with us in these efforts. Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice.

And that is the difference between what we and NORP in ORG are offering the NORP people right now. Let me give you a few specific examples of our different approaches. DATE, I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. CARDINAL of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in GPE. But for DATE, our tax code has actually given MONEY in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in GPE, right here in GPE. And I am proposing that all NORP businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in DATE. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like GPE and GPE and GPE. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. For DATE, NORP have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. PERSON was here in GPE he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like GPE keep CARDINAL of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. PERSON dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps GPE strong. And, GPE, I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in GPE -- not that create jobs overseas. That is CARDINAL difference between the NORP vision and the NORP vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example.

Though I should say it did not stop a lot of them from showing up at the ribbon-cuttings ---- trying to take credit. And engineers, economists, governors, mayors of every political stripe believe that if we want to compete in this global economy, we need to rebuild this vital infrastructure.

Now, for any income over this amount, the tax rates would just go back to what they were under President PERSON. This is not to punish folks who are better off -- PERSON bless them.

And for those who claim that our approach would somehow be bad for growth and bad for small businesses, let me remind you that with those tax rates in place, under President PERSON, this country created CARDINAL jobs and raised incomes and had the largest surplus in our history. In fact, if the NORP leadership in ORG really wants to help small businesses, they will stop using legislative maneuvers to block an up or down vote on a small business jobs bill that is before the ORG right now. This is a bill that would do CARDINAL things. It would cut taxes for small businesses and make loans more available for small businesses. It is fully paid for, will not add to the deficit.

And so I want to thank PERSON and the good folks who are focusing on science, who have opened up a tremendous realm of possibility now to achieve that which we want, a literate GPE. Even the youngest child can learn that we read words and letters from left to right or that letters are associated with sounds; even the youngest of toddlers can figure that out over time. In CARDINAL exercise, children clapped for each syllable in a word. They can trace letters on the page to begin to understand the movements we use to write. They can play word games and learn rhymes and songs that help them to develop their own vocabulary. That sounds like a simple curriculum, but it is research-based, all aimed at laying the foundation for children to become good readers. These are what we call the building blocks, and these building blocks need to be a part of ORG programs all across GPE. Research also shows that if children do not develop these skills before they reach kindergarten, they will struggle to achieve success in their lives.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

We cannot let our children down. Now look, ORG is a great opportunity to provide the foundation for reading. And first, I just want everybody to understand, ORG does a good job of giving children nutrition and medical care. That has been primarily the focus, and the program needs to be applauded for meeting that goal. And nobody in this room wants ORG to change that focus. We just want an additional focus to ORG, and the ORG focus is teaching the basics for reading and math. That is the new focus, along with health and nutrition. Even though most children in ORG make some educational progress, most of them still leave the program with skills and knowledge levels that are far below what we expect. Now, in my line of work, if you see a problem, you address it. And I see that as a problem. If we are not meeting expectations, if we are not challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, let us start right now in GPE. We want ORG to set higher ambitions for the CARDINAL children it serves. And so I laid out a plan. Every ORG center must prepare children to succeed by teaching the basics of learning and literacy. That is the cornerstone of the plan. And every ORG teacher must have the skills necessary to do so. And so we started DATE when we launched ORG, ORG, to train CARDINAL ORG teachers and supervisors in the C.I.R.C.L.E. program, which is used right here at this school. In other words, it is a go-by. It is not a difficult chore for a teacher to take the basic learning from the C.I.R.C.L.E. program developed by the scientists and implement it at the ORG program in which he or she teaches. PERSON, the assistant ORG supervisor at GPE, was one of the teachers in the program. PERSON and CARDINAL of other trained teachers went back to train other teachers at the program.

Now, in order to make sure that the C.I.R.C.L.E. program is-and other curriculums which work-are being used, is working, I believe there needs to be an evaluation program. And after all, if we are spending a lot of taxpayers' money, which we are, it makes sense to determine whether or not these programs are, in fact, laying the foundation for reading. Now, I fully understand a DATE child is not going to take a standardized test. That we would-we would be defeating the purpose of accountability before we even began if we said, Okay, we will give standardized tests to DATE. But we can have children assessed by asking simple questions. You know, words go left to right. Are you able to identify certain sounds? Are they developed by-developing the key skills necessary? And I think what needs to happen is- and I hope ORG agrees-that the simple evaluations at DATE and DATE will tell us whether or not progress is being made in developing a curriculum necessary to teach children how to read. And if they are, we ought to be praising the programs, and if they are not, something else ought to happen. We cannot miss the opportunity much longer in GPE. And so PERSON is here because his committee and the ORG is considering legislation that would put a new emphasis on language skills and literacy skills in ORG programs. In other words, we are going to codify into law that which we have started through the teacher training program. The legislation will require ORG providers to teach language, reading, and writing skills, as well as early math skills. In other words, it now becomes a part- when they pass the law that says the ORG mission is further defined as an educational mission. And those programs that are used must be proven by scientific research. We are going to have high standards. We are going to trust the local people to develop the curriculum, but in return for ORG money, we want you to measure to tell us whether or not children are learning to read and write.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

And therefore, we are asking people to develop an accountability system without everybody being at the same starting position. And that is why it is so important for preschool programs to be focused on literacy, so that when the accountability systems kick in in GPE or GPE or anybody else, we can truthfully say that every child has been given the tools necessary to be at the starting line at the same time, so that we have true accountability, true measurement. Now, there is Governors around the State, the country that have said, Look, give us the flexibility to be able to dovetail the ORG program into our preschool programs so that all students-so we have a better control over whether or not the students are given the skills necessary so that when you hold us to account, we can achieve that which we want to achieve, which is excellence in the classroom. I appreciate the desire for flexibility. I support the Governors' desire for flexibility so long as, CARDINAL, NORP monies going to the States are used only for ORG. In other words, what we really do not want to do is say we are going to focus on ORG; the ORG money goes for, you know, a prison complex. I know that will not happen with Governor PERSON, but there needs to be a guarantee that the NORP money spent on ORG only go to ORG. Secondly, States and local governments must put money into the program, which would lock in the ORG money for ORG. So, in other words, the flexibility given to the ORG would not allow the GPE budget flexibility. It is management flexibility to be able to take the Head Start program, dovetail into the preschool program, then the kindergarten program, and then into the elementary school program. Governors ought to have that flexibility to-hope that ORG will provide that flexibility so that when the accountability systems kick in, fully kick in, that a Governor can truthfully say, Well, I have had the tools necessary to make sure the Head Start program fits into an overall comprehensive plan for literacy and math for every child in GPE, in Governor PERSON's case.

I would like to say at the beginning that this is a very wise decision that the ORG has made. And I would like to emphasize that the registration act-which has now been passed and will go into effect-is not to threaten war, but is to preserve peace. The action taken by our country and almost all other nations in the democratic world is designed to preserve peace. We are deeply concerned about the unwarranted and vicious invasion of GPE by GPE and occupation by them of this innocent and defenseless country, which is completely unwarranted. We have taken a series of steps-economic, diplomatic, political, military steps-in order to convince GPE that their action is ill advised and, of course, encouraging them to withdraw their troops from GPE and also to prevent further aggression if they should be tempted to do so. All of the action we have taken is peaceful in nature, and we will stay committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes. The freedom-fighters in GPE, who are striving for the liberation of their country, deserve the admiration of the entire world, and their courage and persistence in fighting for freedom is the greatest single deterrent to the NORP aggression being successful. I would like to emphasize that the registration act is not a draft; I am not in favor of a peacetime draft. This registration act will do a great deal to marshal our own Nation's resistance to succumbing to temptation which might lead to war, and therefore lead to a mandatory draft. The only time that I envision a mandatory draft law being advocated to the ORG would be in time of war or in time of national emergency, and in a case of that kind, when our Nation's security is threatened, separate legal action would be required by ORG, a separate law, to initiate a draft under those circumstances.

But, as all of you know, the devastation remains. We have got PERCENT unemployment. Many of you watching at home, as you go around the country and your individual communities, you see the stores shuttered and the foreclosed businesses; friends and neighbors, family members who still cannot find work. This is on top of DATE that had been tough for middle class families all across the country. They had not seen their incomes go up in DATE. Their costs skyrocketing at the same time as their wages were stagnant. For DATE, I heard stories all across the country, everywhere I go. I heard stories about people trying their best to hold on; a family sitting around the kitchen table wondering if they were going to be able to retire on schedule, if they were going to be able to finance a college education for their kids, wondering when would health care costs stop climbing, when would their premiums start stabilizing. And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the NORP Dream, was slipping away. That is the reason I ran for ORG. That is the reason you supported me. And that is why we are going to continue to do everything we can to create an economy that has not just recovered back to the status quo, but an economy where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded, and where businesses are hiring and wages are rising, and where our middle class is getting stronger and more secure.

Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern GPE and the people of GPE must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine. And that problem affects all doctors, from family practitioners in rural towns to surgeons in big-city hospitals.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose TIME in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. GPE's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains MONEY from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand.

I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, CARDINAL, I understand the problem and I intend to work with ORG to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of GPE, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. CARDINAL is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the ORG that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from CARDINAL area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from CARDINAL area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your ORG budget spends MONEY a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for ORG and ORG and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to ORG with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, PERCENT of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life.

Interestingly enough, GPE has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in DATE. Patients in that GPE see their claims settled CARDINAL faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since DATE, insurance premiums for GPE doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most GPE. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the ORG ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, ORG needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. CARDINAL docs leave CARDINAL counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on DATE about medical liability. The ORG passed a good medical liability reform bill DATE. I want to thank the CARDINAL Members of ORG for working on it. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the NORP people. Both ORG will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the ORG to get the bill moving. It is important for the GPE Senators from this GPE and other GPE to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in DATE.

This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for NORP manufacturers and entrepreneurs. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in GPE. The number of class actions filed here increased by PERCENT DATE, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from GPE. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers.

Asbestos lawsuits in southern GPE and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of CARDINAL of companies and cost CARDINAL of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick.

For DATE now, ORG has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. DATE at ORG, I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for DATE. The plan will strengthen ORG by controlling cost, promoting competition, and dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to keeping ORG solvent until DATE.

Once the cure for many illnesses was a scalpel; now, just as likely, it is a pharmaceutical. That is why I made helping seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical care a key part of the ORG plan. But even as we modernize ORG with the prescription drug benefit, we also must modernize ORG's preventive care benefits. DATE, doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases earlier and more effectively than ever. And for CARDINAL, early detection can mean the difference between a full recovery and a bleak prognosis. For instance, if prostate cancer is caught early, the survival rate is PERCENT; but if it is not , the rate can be a discouraging PERCENT. In DATE we worked across party lines to expand ORG coverage for preventive services. But too few seniors still are using this benefit. DATE just CARDINAL in CARDINAL older women received a mammogram covered by ORG. For many seniors on fixed incomes, who DATE must struggle to pay for food, rent, and other necessities, the cost of even a modest copayment can be prohibitive, and that can cost lives. It makes no sense for ORG to put up roadblocks to screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its screenings might have avoided.

At the time when it was started the public-school system of GPE had begun and was in the process of its first development. The development of the high school, especially during DATE, has been literally phenomenal. Nothing like our present system of education was known in earlier times.

I think that all of us who also endeavor to deal with that citizenship in the raw in our own homes appreciate the burden and the responsibility. The training given in the public schools must, of course, be not merely a training in intellect, but a training in what counts for infinitely more than intellect-a training in character. And the chief factor in that training must be the personal equation of the teachers; the influence exerted, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, by the man or woman who stands in so peculiar a relation to the boys and girls under his or her care-a relation closer, more intricate, and more vital in its after-effects than any other relation save that of parent and child. Wherever a burden of that kind is laid, those who carry it necessarily carry a great responsibility.

I think the major obstacle to peace is going to be the politics of both NORP and NORP trying to take advantage of the difficult work that these CARDINAL leaders are going to have to do to define a state; that is what I think. I think that extremists, in some instances, will try to stop the peace. I believe there is a lot of forces at play in GPE that will try to stop these CARDINAL men from defining what a state will look like. And my job is to help them stay on the big picture and have the confidence necessary to make tough decisions. But there is a mechanism to deal with that, and that is ORG, for the best word-is the trilateral commission, which we head, to deal with these roadmap issues. Now, we can solve those-we can work through those problems, but the key is to define a state. And the reason I believe it is because these CARDINAL men, with whom I have spent a fair amount of time, are committed. The state will come into being subject to a roadmap. But the first step is to define what is possible; here is what a state will look like. And that is very important for both the NORP and the NORP. Well, the key is for me to convince the CARDINAL leaders to work through the hard issues. I will help them, but in order for there to be lasting peace, they have got to come to the table; they have got to negotiate it. And what ends up happening in this process is that the leaders will commit, and then they will get their committees to work, and it gets stuck. And that is when I will have to work with PERSON to unstick it, just to keep it moving. CARDINAL thing is, is that they know that they have got a good partner in peace in me. They also know that I am not going to be in office DATE, so there is a certain urgency to get this state defined. And my trip is going to be to just kind of keep momentum.

If ORG would suspend their enrichment programs, like the international community has demanded, there is a better way forward for them. But they say that they need this program.

And what were you doing with a military-secret military program in the first place? And so I view GPE as a danger; I truly do.

We will continue to pressure them on the diplomatic front. And it is hard, because sometimes people are more interested in market share for their goods than they are for achieving peace. And so I have spent a lot of time with allies in Europe, for example, convincing them of the importance of working together to send a common message to the NORP regime.

He showed courage and leadership, and he needs to have a military that is able to function at the behest of a state to provide security.

You know, there are a whole range of benefits that have helped to build companies, create value, create profits. For you to continue to benefit from that entire architecture that helps you thrive, but move your technical address simply to avoid paying taxes, is neither fair nor is it something that is going to be good for the country over the long term.

Well, we reached out repeatedly to both NORP and NORP. If we lower corporate tax rates and close loopholes, there is going to be more certainty in terms of what corporations pay. They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance.

And if we close some of those loopholes, not just carried interest but a range that we know are not economically productive, then sure, some folks do not get to take advantage of stuff they should've been taking advantage of anyway. But that also means we can finance government, keep our deficits under control, and invest in the things that we need to grow over the long term. There is no doubt that the economies of GPE and Europe have intertwined, primarily around the energy sector. And it makes some NORP more concerned about a robust response to the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity that GPE's been conducting when it comes to GPE. The good news is that, despite some of those commercial concerns, we have seen Europe move with us - not always as fast as we'd like, but they get there. And sadly, tragically, the shooting down of this ORG airliner and the recognition that it is likely it was shot down and it is also likely that it was conducted by non-state actors that were provided incredibly powerful weapons by the NORP government - all that, I think, may stiffen the spine of my NORP partners moving forward. I want to ask you about GPE. What do you make of these - the ORG banning these flights and then lifting it? Do you think it is safe for NORP to fly to GPE? You know, we have not made decisions when it comes to airline safety based on not just politics, but even our strong alliance with GPE. We have to just look at the facts. The initial ban that was imposed by the ORG was based on GPE needing to show us that, in fact, it was safe for commercial airlines to fly in.

It makes sure that we actually start bending the cost curve, controlling the rising premiums by instituting better practices in terms of how we reimburse doctors and how we ask hospitals to work together. We have already invested in electronic IT, electronic medical records, things that can help make the system more efficient. So we have this enormous opportunity.

And we employ a couple of people around us. What is being done to free up funding and encourage the growth of all the small businesses that have such a tremendous impact on our economy? how exactly are you planning on helping small businesses grow and prosper, besides simply providing tax breaks? Well, let me start with some specific issues that confront every small business all across the country. And it is absolutely true that if we can get small businesses back on their feet, then that is going to go a long way towards bringing the unemployment rate down, because that is the fastest generator of jobs across the country. Number CARDINAL, small businesses really are still struggling with financing. You hear stories everywhere you go that even profitable, successful businesses are having trouble getting financing, because banks frankly just do not want to take the risk. After having taken way too many risk before, now they are taking no risk. And small businesses are punished for that. So we have expanded the ORG loan, the ORG loan, portfolio by PERCENT. We have been waiving guarantees and fees, trying to streamline the process, just to get more capital into the hands of small businesses. It is important to see if we can give more incentives to small business. So, for example, we are just eliminating capital gains for small businesses, which is particularly important if you have got a start-up. DATE, you may end up being successful with your small business, but suddenly you have got to pay taxes on it. If you can take that money and, instead of paying PERSON, reinvest it in your business, you can grow it further. So we think that that is the kind of strategy that makes a lot of sense. We want to also make sure that we are providing tax credits for hiring of small businesses -- small businesses that are hiring new employees. And so we have got a whole range of proposals there. Now, in addition to the tax credits, in addition to the financing, CARDINAL of the other things that, frankly, small businesses need is just a economic environment that is growing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

That PERCENT swing offers greater opportunities for small businesses to prosper and thrive. CARDINAL of the biggest burdens on small businesses is health-care costs. And probably nobody benefits more from our health-care proposals than small businesses, because what we are doing is we are saying that not only will you get tax credits to buy health insurance, but we are also going to let you pool, buy in to a big exchange so that you have the same purchasing power as a big company like -- ORG or, you know, ORG is able to negotiate with insurance companies and get a good deal. Well, now small businesses, by pooling together in this exchange, are going to have that same leverage. That will help lower their costs. And for a lot of small businesses, it is not just a matter of giving health insurance to your employees; it is also just being able to buy health insurance for yourself. That will cut down on small businesses' costs and they will be able to, again, invest more in their business.

Now that taxpayers bailed them out, they refuse to help us out. And I would like to know what say you, PERSON. Well, look, this is something that we have been dealing with since the beginning of this financial crisis. We set up a program for loan modification that so far CARDINAL people have taken advantage of across the country. You have got CARDINAL people who have gotten loan modifications that are saving them an average of $MONEY.

I get letters all the time of people who've gone through all kinds of hoops, filled out forms; the bank does not call them back, or after they have gone through a trial period, the bank says, Well, you know, we now think we should not give you a home modification. What we are trying to do is to increase transparency and force all the banks to tell us exactly what are you doing with your customers who want to stay in their homes, can afford to pay a mortgage but need something a little bit more limited.

Can we do the same thing for health insurance -- take classes in cooking, nutrition, stress management, communication, parenting, stopping smoking, maybe even exercise classes, and get a reduction on our DATE premiums?

We probably do not want the insurance companies, though, making those decisions, because insurance companies have every incentive to take the youngest, healthiest people and insure them, since they are less likely to have to pay out, and then leave older, sicker individuals out of their insurance pools. So it is important in any health-care program to make sure that the young and the healthy and the older and -- and the sicker are in a single pool.

That would provide a huge amount of relief for people. We still need to expand more the Pell grant program, make it both accessible to more people and raise the amount of tuition. In order to pay for this -- the best part of this is we can actually figure out how to pay for it, because right now you have got a lot of banks and financial-service companies who are still middlemen in the federally guaranteed loan programs. And if we can cut those middlemen out, then you have got MONEY that you can invest in the programs that I just described. This is something that I have made a top priority.

And you know, we have got to work through that process because ORG ultimately controls the purse strings in creating new facilities. If ORG makes a decision that they are going to try to block the opening of a new facility, it potentially constrains what our administration can do. And so this is something that we have got to work through both in ORG but also with public opinion, so that people understand that ultimately this is the right thing to do; by closing FAC, we can regain the moral high ground in the battle against these terrorist organizations. There is been no bigger propaganda weapon for many of these extremists than pointing to FAC and saying that we do not live up to our own ideals. And that is something that I strongly believe we have to resist, even if it has some costs to it and even if it is not always the most politically popular thing to do. ENTITY, we do not have much time left, but I want to make sure we get to the issue of energy, the environment. CARDINAL of the rare moments where you were able to get applause from your friends on the NORP side of the aisle in ORG TIME was when you mentioned nuclear energy. And DATE your budget announced tripling the loan guarantees for nuclear reactors. A lot of people had questions about just how this will work and why you did that. ENTITY, record numbers of young people elected you, in support of a clean-energy future. If money is tight, why do you propose wasting CARDINAL in expensive nuclear, dirty coal and offshore drilling?

{"id": 2955, "text": "Well, you are not going to get any argument from me about the need to create clean-energy jobs. I think this is going to be the driver of our economy over the long term. And that is why we put in record amounts of money for solar and wind and biodiesel and all the other alternative, clean-energy sources that are out there. In the meantime, though, unfortunately, no matter how fast we ramp up those energy sources, we are still going to have enormous energy needs that will be unmet by alternative energy. And the question then is, where -- where will that come from? Nuclear energy has the advantage of not emitting greenhouse gases. For those who are concerned about climate change, we have to recognize that countries like GPE and GPE and others have been much more aggressive in their nuclear industry, and much more successful in having that a larger part of their portfolio, without incident, without accidents. We are mindful of the concerns about storage of spent fuel and concerns about security. But we still think it is the right thing to do, if we are serious about dealing with climate change. With respect to clean-coal technology, it is not possible at this point to completely eliminate coal from the menu of our energy options. And if we are ever going to deal with climate change in a serious way, where we know GPE and GPE are going to be greatly reliant on coal, we have got to start developing clean-coal technologies that can sequester the harmful emissions; because otherwise, countries like GPE and GPE are not going to stop using coal, we will still have those same problems, but we will not have the technology to make sure that it does not harm the environment over the long term. So I know that there is some skepticism about whether there is such a thing as clean-coal technology. What is true is right now, that we do not have all the technology to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from a coal -- coal-powered -- power plants. But the technology is close, and it makes sense for us to make that investment now, not only because it'll be good for GPE, but it will also ultimately be good internationally. We can license and export that technology in ways that help other countries use a better form of energy that is going to be helpful to the climate-change issue.

It makes sure that we are putting teachers back in the classroom. It makes certain that we are providing incentives to hire veterans who have been out of work, but also the long-term unemployed who are out of work.

I will tell you, I am, I'd say, as concerned, if not increasingly concerned, about the lives of NORP. I mean, we still have some supplies there, thank heaven. But it is so brutal and so inhumane and so directly in contravention of international law that I am increasingly concerned about that. You saw some reports I did in the morning paper about testimony about the condition under which some of these guests I mean, hostages are being held. That worries me. Anytime an NORP citizen is held against his or her will, of course, the President is concerned about that. Is there any way you can get aid to them short of war?

But whether there is been a direct contact from Mr. PERSON in our FAC in GPE, I do not know about it, and I'd be inclined to doubt that because of the inhumane way in which our FAC is isolated.

Anybody should have free access to come or go where they want to.  They ought not to have to go be marched off as prisoners. And so, clearly, I'd call on them, and so is ORG. This is in keeping with the ORG condemnation. Are you going to keep them there now that the ORG has at least given you the right to resupply them? I think we have to look at that. And the main thing is, at this juncture, there are priorities to be sure people have enough to eat and that they are not put under continued duress there. Well, have you made your point? Is it necessary to have them there anymore? There are other NORP there, and always your ORG has kind of a consular service to try to service the concerns of other citizens. But as others are brutalized and thus sent into hiding, why, that function becomes a little more blurred. So, I just do not know the answer to that. If they blocked resupply, would that be the sort of provocation you have spoken about earlier? Either it would be directly contravening a mandate from ORG, and we would view that very seriously, yes.

We have got an Ambassador on the ground there working with the ORG Ambassador to bring peace. Having said that, it is important, however, to continue to work, though, to replace troops in a responsible manner with civil institutions, civil structures that can do the same thing the troops are doing. We have got to work for a police force and security arrangements that are run locally, so that the ORG troops at some point in time will no longer serve as peacekeepers. Now, that is obviously more opportunistic to do that in GPE than it is in GPE at this point in time, but nevertheless, we must do so. In terms of the ORG, I believe that we can have a very constructive relationship with the ORG. Obviously, there are some concerns where we differ, but we should not allow these differences-like biotechnology, for example, which I talked about DATE in my speech regarding developing nations. The ORG came out-this is kind of an aside-the ORG came out with a very interesting study that made it clear that biotech and biotechnology will enhance the ability of poor nations to grow more plentiful amounts of food.

{"id": 3039, "text": "There are CARDINAL key elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. That is why I believe the first thing any tobacco legislation must include is a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. These penalties should be non-tax-deductible, uncapped, and escalating to give the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting children as new customers. CARDINAL of the surest ways of reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Today I call for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by MONEY a pack over DATE, as needed, to meet our youth reduction targets. And I call upon the ORG to follow the lead of ORG and repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a MONEY tax credit. Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the ORG to regulate tobacco products. I believe the ORG's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as strong and effective as its authority over drugs and devices. In particular, legislation cannot impose any special procedural hurdles on the ORG's regulation of tobacco products. Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable, especially in any efforts to market products to children, while insisting on changes in the way it does business. I ask the industry again to make a voluntary commitment to stop advertising to children. And I call upon ORG to pass legislation providing for broad document disclosure so that the public can learn everything the tobacco companies know about the health effects of their products and their attempts to market to our children. Fourth, Federal tobacco legislation must aim not only to reduce youth smoking but to meet other health goals as well. These include the reduction of secondhand smoke, the expansion of smoking prevention and cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other important health objectives. We must build on the bipartisan agreement to fund children's health care in the recent balanced budget. And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities. We know that tobacco farmers are honest, hardworking people, most of whom live and work on small, family owned farms. In some GPE, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must protect these farmers, their families, and their communities from loss of income.

And finally, let me say again, we would not be here if it were not for all the people in this room and the countless others they represent around the country. To me, this is not about money. It is not about how much money we can extract from the tobacco industry. It is about fulfilling our duties as parents and responsible adults to protect our children and to build the future of this country. We are doing everything we can in this administration to give parents the tools they need to raise their children, but parents have to be our partners as well. If this is not just about money, we have to recognize that even beyond the tobacco companies and all of us in this room, every parent in GPE has a responsibility to talk to their children about the dangers of tobacco, illegal drugs, and other things that can hurt them. We know if we have strong parental responsibility here, they can make a great deal of difference in protecting our children as well. If we take responsibility, if we pass this legislation, if we do what we should here, if the tobacco industry will work with us, if other Members of ORG in both parties will work with us, we will have gone a very long way toward creating the state of health for our children that will make GPE an even greater nation in DATE.

But we cannot have the ORG crippled here, and we have to have real and meaningful penalties if the targets for youth smoking are not met. And so I feel very good about that.

Do you believe that? Keep in mind -- if you are a NORP -- and we have heard some NORP make this argument -- some of those who are leading the charge on this make this argument -- and essentially, what they are saying is, once this is fully implemented and CARDINAL of people who currently do not have health care have health care at reasonable prices and protections are in place for consumers across the board, that it will be sufficiently successful and popular that people will not want to repeal it. So the notion is we have got to stop it before people like it too much. Well, part of the argument is sometimes, people come to like things that the government cannot afford anymore. Well, this is -- this is the argument that was made with respect to ORG; this is the argument that was made to ORG. It turns out, actually, people liked it, and we could afford it. And unlike the prescription drug plan that was passed by NORP, which now is very popular with seniors, although at the time that it was passed was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls -- we paid for the Affordable Care Act. It does not add to the deficit. If the assumptions in current law held. Well -- but the assumptions so far not only have held, they have actually exceed expectations. Health care costs have gone up slower since we passed the Affordable Care Act. There were great predictions coming from the NORP that health care costs would go up even faster; that has not happened. There were predictions that the market places that we are setting up -- essentially, the group plans where people buy health insurance -- would not offer a good deal to consumers. And so far, the bids have come in from insurance companies, and lo and behold, they have actually come under the estimates that the government had so far.

Globalization, combined with technology, have stripped away a lot of the basic security that middle-income people had because a lot of those middle-income jobs have left.

Well, I do not accept that. GPE is, always been, at its best when everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to succeed. I mean, we are seeing the same trends in NORP countries that historically were -- prided themselves on great equality. We have seen it magnified in less developed countries and emerging markets.

At that point, any president -- not just me -- any president is subject to that kind of blackmail continuously.

And therefore, in a very profound sense in the modern world, it is more important that people be striving for the kind of spiritual presence of mind and peace of mind that will lead you to use words to build up and to unify, instead of to divide and tear down. And I really do believe that. I think that it is clearly different from any previous time. Words have always been able to wound in letters or speeches or whatever.

Related to that, some people suggest that both your welfare reform proposals and the ORG welfare reform proposal takes such Draconian measures against these unwed teen mothers in terms of limits that what it is likely to do is to drive up the abortion rate, not stop the unwanted pregnancy rate but drive up the abortion rate. Well, I do not agree with that in my proposal, and obviously I do not know what would happen in the others, but let us look at that. The abortion rate has been going down in GPE. And I think it is been going down for maybe because of all the protest against abortion. But I also think that most NORP have deeply ambivalent feelings. That is, I believe that a majority of NORP are pro-choice and anti-abortion. That is, they do not believe that the decision should be criminalized because there are too many different circumstances where most of us feel that decisions should be left to the people who are involved rather than having a totally legal prohibition. On the other hand, most people think in most circumstances that abortion is wrong and that it should not be done. So the abortion rate is going down in GPE.

And we say do not cut the parents off of public assistance unless, number CARDINAL, they are bad parents or, number CARDINAL, they do things which will undermine their ability to either be successful workers or successful parents. So for example, the way our plan works is if you are a teenager and you have a baby, in order to draw the public assistance in a normal way you'd have to stay in school, you'd have to live at home with your parents, and if you lived in a bad home you'd have to live in some other supervised setting. You'd have to cooperate and help identify the father so we could attempt to get the father to pay child support and support the child. If at the end of your education period and training, if DATE have elapsed and you have not gone to work, then you would have to go to work if there were a job available.

But I do not think you can say from that that there is no national interest which should command some taxpayer support to make sure that these children have minimal levels of nutrition and medical care and just the basic things that it seems to me we have got an interest in doing, because we do not want to lose any more of these kids than we have to. The welfare benefits themselves, by the way, are not a problem. So nobody goes on welfare for the check. It is the child care; it is the food stamps; it is the medical care for your children. Therefore, nearly anybody who can will get off and go to work if they can take care of their children and their children will not lose their health care. But do I think the churches should do more?

I have never tried to say that for example, I never tried to say that there was a NORP coalition behind anything I did, you know, that God had ordained us to do these following things and I knew it, and anybody that did not was seized by the Devil. I never said that. I have said that like every other person, I consider myself a sinner because I believe I consider myself forgiven. I consider you know, I need the power of God. This is a humble thing for me. But it is an important part of my life and has been for a long time, but especially again in DATE and before I became ENTITY. And the same thing is true for PERSON. I think the truth is that there are people who do not believe it is genuine because they disagree with me politically. They do not believe that you could be a committed NORP and not want to criminalize all abortions. I just do not believe you can be that is what they think. They do not believe that you could be a committed NORP and believe that take the position that I took on gays in the military. They thought think the Bible dictated the previous policy on gays in the military, even though we fought CARDINAL World Wars, GPE, and GPE with a different policy. But they do not believe that. So then I think there are people, once they disagree with you so much, who will believe who will believe in perpetuating anything anybody says about you, and so they think that is evidence of that. But you know, the Bible is full of refutations of the latter point. All they had to do was read the Scripture to know better than to make that argument.

But when we passed the PERSON bill, that is the best we could do. We had to take a bill that would say a DATE waiting period, but insta-check whenever possible when it became possible.

Punish people that violate the law; throw the book at them; but in this area alone, let us do not have much prevention, because we are worried about the second amendment or a slippery slope or whatever. I think that we can save so many more lives by sensible prevention and not interfere with legitimate gun owners. ENTITY, did you ever own a gun? I have owned a shotgun.

No, that was not a part of the agreement.

I would have thought when ORG came forward, since this had nothing to do with the PERSON bill or anything else-this was about having gun dealers clean up their act and gun manufacturers putting the hammer on them to do it, rewarding those that are good, punishing those that are not .

They have been there essentially for DATE without sufficient reinforcements, and the number of ORG that have come into the city now are relatively small compared to what happened in GPE. But it is indicative that the training of NORP security forces, the fortifications, the command-and-control systems are not happening fast enough in GPE, in the NORP parts of the country.

Those predominantly NORP areas, you are not seeing any forward momentum by ORG, and ORG has been significantly degraded across the country.

You are under virtually no pressure correct me if I am wrong but you are under virtually no pressure domestically to get more deeply involved in the Middle East. That seems to be one of the downstream consequences of the GPE invasion DATE. As you said, I am very clear on the lessons of GPE.

How do we find effective partners not just in GPE, but in GPE, and in GPE, and in GPE that we can work with, and how do we create the international coalition and atmosphere in which people across sectarian lines are willing to compromise and are willing to work together in order to provide the next generation a fighting chance for a better future?

Well, Prince PERSON said it publicly Well, he is not in the government. There has been no indication from the NORP or any other countries that they have an intention to pursue their own nuclear program. Part of the reason why they would not pursue their own nuclear program assuming that we have been successful in preventing GPE from continuing down the path of obtaining a nuclear weapon is that the protection that we provide as their partner is a far greater deterrent than they could ever hope to achieve by developing their own nuclear stockpile or trying to achieve breakout capacity when it comes to nuclear weapons, and they understand that. What we saw at the ORG summit was, I think, legitimate skepticism and concern, not simply about the NORP nuclear program itself but also the consequences of sanctions coming down. We walked through the CARDINAL pathways that would be shut off in any agreement that I would be signing off on. Technically, we showed them how it would be accomplished what the verification mechanisms will be, how the ORG snapback provisions might work. They were satisfied that if in fact the agreement meant the benchmarks that we have set forth, that it would prevent GPE from getting a nuclear weapon, and given that, they understand that ultimately their own security and defense is much better served by working with us. Their covert presumably pursuit of a nuclear program would greatly strain the relationship they have got with GPE. I just want you to help me square something.

And yet, you have also argued that the regime in GPE a regime you have described as NORP, among other problems that they have is practical, and is responsive to incentive, and shows signs of rationality. So I do not understand how these things fit together in your mind. Well the fact that you are NORP, or racist, does not preclude you from being interested in survival. It does not preclude you from being rational about the need to keep your economy afloat; it does not preclude you from making strategic decisions about how you stay in power; and so the fact that the supreme leader is NORP does not mean that this overrides all of his other considerations. You know, if you look at the history of anti-Semitism, ENTITY, there were a whole lot of NORP leaders and there were deep strains of anti-Semitism in this country  They may make irrational decisions with respect to discrimination, with respect to trying to use anti-Semitic rhetoric as an organizing tool. At the margins, where the costs are low, they may pursue policies based on hatred as opposed to self-interest. But the costs here are not low, and what we have been very clear to the NORP regime over DATE is that we will continue to ratchet up the costs, not simply for their anti-Semitism, but also for whatever expansionist ambitions they may have. That is what the sanctions represent. That is what the military option I have made clear I preserve represents. And so I think it is not at all contradictory to say that there are deep strains of anti-Semitism in the core regime, but that they also are interested in maintaining power, having some semblance of legitimacy inside their own country, which requires that they get themselves out of what is a deep economic rut that we have put them in, and on that basis they are then willing and prepared potentially to strike an agreement on their nuclear program.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjefferygoldbergtheatlantic", "title": "Interview with Jeffery Goldberg of The Atlantic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jeffery-goldberg-the-atlantic", "publication_date": "19-05-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

To me that sounds like a little bit of wishful thinking that is going to want to get paid, ORG is going to see, among other groups, might see a little bit of a windfall from MONEY that might pour in. I am not assuming something completely in the other direction either, but I just do not know where your confidence comes from. Well I do not think PERSON or anybody in this administration said that no money will go to the military as a consequence of sanctions relief. The question is, if GPE has MONEY parked outside the country, does the ORG automatically get MONEY? Does MONEY then translate by orders of magnitude into their capacity to project power throughout the region? And that is what we contest, because when you look at the math, first of all they are going to have to deliver on their obligations under any agreement, which would take a certain period of time. Then there are the mechanics of unwinding the existing restraints they have on getting that money, which takes a certain amount of time. Then PERSON and, by extension, the supreme leader have made a series of commitments to improve the NORP economy, and the expectations are outsized. You saw the reaction of people in the streets of GPE after the signing of the agreement. You have NORP elites who are champing at the bit to start moving business and getting out from under the restraints that they have been under. And what is also true is that the ORG right now, precisely because of sanctions, in some ways are able to exploit existing restrictions to have a monopoly on what comes in and out of the country, and they have got their own revenue sources that they have been able to develop, some of which may actually lessen as a consequence of sanctions relief.

They are not a threat to the region because of their hardware. They have a missile program. We have to think about missile-defense systems and how those are integrated and coordinated. But the big problems we have are weapons going in to ORG, or them sending agents into GPE, or other low-tech asymmetric threats that they are very effective at exploiting, which they are already doing they have been doing despite sanctions. They will continue to do unless we are developing greater capacity to prevent them from doing those things, which is part of what our discussion was in terms of the security assurances with the ORG countries. You know, if you look at a situation like GPE, part of the problem is the chronic, endemic weakness in a state like that, and the instability that GPE then seeks to exploit. If you had ORG countries who were more capable of maritime interdiction, effective intelligence, cutting off financing sources, and are more effective in terms of working and training with allied forces in a place like GPE, so that NORP cannot just march into GPE, well, if all those things are being done, GPE having MONEY from sanctions relief is not going to override those improvements and capabilities, and that is really where we have to focus. ORG has a certain number of fighters who are hardened and effective. If GPE has some additional resources, then perhaps they are less strained in trying to make payroll when it comes to ORG, but it is not as if they can suddenly train up and successfully deploy CARDINAL times the number of ORG fighters that are currently in GPE. That is not something that they have automatic capacity to do.  You could buy more rockets and put them in south GPE. Well, and the issue though with respect to rockets in south GPE is not whether enough money to do so. They have shown a commitment to doing that even when their economy is in the tank.

There are obviously NORP in GPE who are immune to the charms of this argument, led by PERSON but not only him. All the steps he is taken he meaning you against GPE are liable to bring about the destruction of the state. I have my own theories about why there is this bifurcation in the NORP NORP community, and we have discussed this in past interviews, but what is going on? Is this the byproduct of well-intentioned anxiety about GPE, about the explosive growth of anti-Semitism in Europe? Let me depersonalize it a little bit. I consistently received overwhelming majority support from the NORP community, and even after all the publicity around the recent differences that I have had with Prime Minister PERSON, the majority of the NORP NORP community still supports me, and supports me strongly. It was PERCENT in the last election. I think that there are a lot of crosscurrents that are going on right now. There is no doubt that the environment worldwide is scary for a lot of NORP families. You have mentioned some of those trends. You have a Middle East that is turbulent and chaotic, and where extremists seem to be full of enthusiasm and momentum. You have Europe, where, as you have very effectively chronicled, there is an emergence of a more overt and dangerous anti-Semitism. And so part of the concern in the NORP community is that, only a generation removed from the Holocaust, it seems that NORP rhetoric and NORP rhetoric is on the rise. What I also think is that there has been a very concerted effort on the part of some political forces to equate being pro-Israel, and hence being supportive of the NORP people, with a rubber stamp on a particular set of policies coming out of the NORP government.

And they may sincerely believe it. My response to them is that, precisely because I care so deeply about GPE, precisely because I care so much about the NORP people, I feel obliged to speak honestly and truthfully about what I think will be most likely to lead to long-term security, and will best position us to continue to combat anti-Semitism, and I make no apologies for that precisely because I am secure and confident about how deeply I care about GPE and the NORP people.

Yeah, and I have to say, ENTITY, I completely disagree with that assessment, and I know you wrote that. And I objected to it.

Do you think that all the campaigning among CARDINAL contenders for the NORP nomination has changed public perception of you along those lines or along other lines on Well, even before a campaign started, this has been pretty much the theme of the other side. I have been held up as eating my young, that we have been hostile to the poor and our tax program benefits the rich. How can a program that cuts taxes evenly, percentagewise, across the board-thus leaving the same rate of progression in our progressive tax system-how can that be beneficial to the rich and detrimental to the others? How can it be unfair to the people of lower income or the poor to reduce inflation from double PERCENT when we came here-down to CARDINAL of that or less, CARDINAL of that. When the people with the least-let us take someone with $MONEY of income DATE and DATE-before we got here. By DATE that $MONEY would only buy $MONEY worth. He was getting $MONEY a year. He got a $MONEY cut in his ability to buy DATE. That was probably the worst tax on the elderly with fixed incomes, the worst tax on the poor who have to spend most of their earnings on subsistence, on the necessities. The person with luxury income who spends a minor portion of it on necessities and the rest on luxuries, they were not really penalized as much by inflation.

And so far, a number of States have gotten tired of waiting for the ORG to act and do it at a national level, and have put in their own enterprise zone programs.

I wonder what you look at as the main reason for that. What happened to ORG that made it not work like you wanted it to? Nothing happened to ORG. And I am glad you asked this question.

Now, I could turn around and say that maybe the recovery might have been even better if we had gotten-remember that CARDINAL stage of our tax cut-10 percent of it-was going to go into effect retroactively to DATE, and we did not get it then.

But CARDINAL operates primarily against children. It says, kick the children out of the health clinics. That could cause health problems for the general population. It says, kick the children out of the schools, which means teachers are turned into police officers. It means that the kids can be on the street causing problems for themselves and for others. We have already got too many children on the street. So I believe we have to do more. I found a big immigration mess when I became ORG DATE. But this is not the answer, in my opinion, and I hope the voters will turn out and vote and reject CARDINAL. It is a way of dividing our people, it is clearly unconstitutional, and it is looking for easy answers to a tough problem. After all, some of the people that are for CARDINAL are part of the problem. When Governor PERSON was Senator PERSON, he responded to the powerful forces in GPE that wanted more illegal immigrants in GPE to do work. He sponsored legislation to make it more difficult to remove illegal immigrants from the workplace by going easier on the employers. Now he, all of a sudden, has turned CARDINAL degrees on this issue. But this is a complicated issue without a simple solution. I am committed to working with you to find a solution. I hope that our listeners, our viewers, will turn out and vote on DATE and vote against CARDINAL, and I hope they will come to FAC in GPE DATE where I am going to have a rally at TIME. if CARDINAL is approved, do you think it will affect the NAFTA treaty with GPE?

This is what we have been asking for, not just over DATE or DATE, but for DATE, because these chemical weapons pose a significant threat to all nations and to GPE in particular. That is why PERCENT of humanity has said we do not use these. That protects our troops and it protects children like the ones that we saw on those videos inside of GPE.

But we are going to run this to ground. And PERSON and the rest of my national security team will engage with the NORP and the international community to see, can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious. You know, CARDINAL reason that this may have a chance of success is that even GPE's allies, like GPE, detest chemical weapons. GPE, you know, unfortunately was the target of chemical weapons at the hands of PERSON back during the Iraq/Iran War.

PERSON, the ORG secretary general, says not only control the stockpiles of chemical weapons, but then go ahead and destroy them. He is ready to take that to ORG. That is a lot better than deterring the NORP from going ahead and using these chemical weapons. Absolutely, and that is why we are going -- we are going to take this seriously, but I have to consistently point out that we have not seen these kinds of gestures up until now.

You know, again, this does not solve the underlying terrible conflict inside of GPE, but if we can accomplish this limited goal without taking military action, that would be my preference.

Is that requirement in line with the President's vision for what a real path to citizenship is? Well, the President believes, as he made clear in his blueprint that has been available publicly for a long time now, that there has to be a clear pathway to citizenship available; that comprehensive immigration reform must include both that and must continue the focus that he is placed on border security.

When it comes to the actual legislation, we wait for that legislation to be produced, and we will assess it when it is.

Again, a NORP congressionalist is citing another news source, ORG. A NORP congressional aide said that PERSON is pressing harder for the CPI revision than for other entitlement changes. PERSON, ORG Minority Leader -- this is quoting ORG -- said bipartisan agreement on higher ORG premiums for the wealthy and increase in the ORG eligibility age, and slowing cost-of-living increases for ORG could move both parties closer to a budget deal. And by that, a budget deal he meant and everyone meant in DATE, a budget deal that would be balanced and include revenues, which obviously was part of the President's approach.

And cynical attempts to make it otherwise by some represent I think dissonance within ORG, and we have seen plenty of condemnation from conservatives and NORP of that sort of flagrantly ridiculous and cynical attempt to disown a proposal that emanated from NORP leaders.

The President has been directing his national security team to take necessary precautionary measures that will ensure that we can both defend ourself and our allies -- defend ourselves and our allies, defend the homeland. And I think that represents the fact that he is concerned about the stepped-up rhetoric and the provocative behavior by the NORP regime. It is also the case that what we have seen of late from GPE represents a familiar pattern of behavior.

The President has directed his national security team to identify additional measures to continue increasing nonlethal assistance to assist the operation -- the opposition, rather. So I think that addresses your question. We are on an upward trajectory with our assistance, both humanitarian assistance to the NORP people and direct assistance --nonlethal assistance -- to the NORP opposition. And we will continue to step up that assistance. The President has directed his team to identify additional measures that we can take to increase that assistance, and we will have a decision to announce in the future. I do not have an announcement to make DATE. DNI PERSON was on the ORG DATE, and in some important testimony he said directly that if PERSON falls, he said, it is a tough call whether or not the chemical weapons stockpile can be secured. How worried are you about that? It sounds like a pretty dramatic statement from the ORG. Well, there is no question, as we have stated all along, that the disposition of chemical weapons in GPE is a matter of concern to GPE and our allies and partners -- a matter of great concern obviously to countries in the region. And we have made clear, as the President did I believe from this podium, that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons is a red line as far as he is concerned when it comes to the NORP regime. I would point you to what Director PERSON said. I will not engage in hypotheticals about DATE when PERSON is finally -- or when GPE is finally rid of PERSON and what will happen. But you can be sure that the disposition of those weapons will be a matter of focus and concern for this nation, as well as many others. ORG has released some documents that they obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request with the ORG, where ORG agents claim they can go through people's emails and text messages without a warrant. Is ORG concerned about the IRA making that claim in terms of people's privacy? I would have to take the question.

They think the public schools -- they have been home-schooling their kids here in GPE, and they do not like the NORP public schools. It is reached CARDINAL signatures. What is the process for reacting to something like that? And are you aware of this specific case? I am not aware of it. I will certainly take the question. We do have a threshold beyond which we respond to ORG, and if that threshold is crossed, I am sure we will respond. But I do not have a specific comment on this case. ORG Secretary PERSON said of GPE that it is skating very close to a dangerous line. Does the President share that assessment? And has he identified a red line, a line by which GPE crossing that would be unacceptable? Well, I will not engage in hypotheticals about what red lines there are. It is unacceptable to flagrantly violate your international commitments, as GPE continues to do. And the result of that behavior has been increasing international consensus around the proposition that GPE flagrant violations of its obligations must stop. That has resulted in increased isolation and sanctions. It has resulted in all the range of actions that we have taken in response to the recent series of provocative acts and statements. There is no question that GPE -- because of its development of a nuclear weapon, because of its violation of its commitments, its development of missile technology -- represents a danger and a threat. And that is why we address it the way that we do. So I think that the words of Secretary PERSON are reflective of the administration's view of this problem. It is why we have taken the actions that we have taken to ensure that we can enhance both the security of both the homeland and our allies. And we will continue to take necessary, prudent measures as the situation demands.

GPE is already in flagrant violation of its international obligations. It is engaged in the development of nuclear weapons. It is engaged in development of missile technology that is in contradiction to its commitments. And that is why you see the international response that you have seen. And we will continue to work with our allies in GPE and GPE, as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon GPE to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to GPE. There is an opportunity for GPE to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for GPE, and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that GPE takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with NORP. The NORP people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The NORP people expect their leaders in GPE to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for GPE's children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future. The President's budget is a common-sense document that represents a sincere attempt to compromise with NORP on behalf of the whole country. The fact is it is not an la carte menu, as I think PERSON said DATE in our briefing.

It has to be not just revenues on the one hand and entitlement reforms on the other, but the whole approach has to be embraced -- a balanced approach that allows for investments so that our economy can grow, that allows for the kind of security for the middle class and seniors that is so essential. And it allows for the guarantee that those programs represent to our seniors to continue into the future. So the NORP have to decide -- and there are rank-and-file NORP who believe this already, but NORP including leadership has to decide whether they want to find compromise or they would rather stick to positions that are at odds with where most of GPE is, and are certainly at odds with where the President is. Is the President confident he can get his own party on board with this, given the backlash? Does he need to start having dinner with them? The President is confident that -- as he was during the fiscal cliff negotiations, as he was in previous negotiations with the Speaker of the ORG -- that NORP will support a bipartisan compromise that ensures that our assistance programs to our seniors are safeguarded, and that that guarantee is provided; that ensure that investments in education are made, and investments in innovation and research and development and infrastructure are made. The budget represents tough choices, there is no question. But it also expects from the other side that they make tough choices. Back to the CEO meeting TIME -- I know ORG had asked a question -- but I was wondering, did the President plan to bring up unemployment with the executives, and did he talk up his budget a bit with them? I was not in the meeting. I do not have a readout of it. We have a strategy of engagement with the business sector that is ongoing and this is part of that strategy. I certainly would not be surprised if some of these matters came up. The need to deal with growing the economy and creating jobs is his CARDINAL priority. So I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is something that he would want to talk about.

And our outreach includes not just obviously to business, but to a whole range of sectors of the NORP economy and a variety of groups with different interests. I think what you have seen from ORG is an engagement with business around the simple proposition that we need to take steps to reform our immigration system because that is good for the economy and good for the middle class. We need to take steps to reduce gun violence, and there are some business leaders who are very much interested in that effort.

I, as you would expect, am not going to talk about classified documents that others would have obtained.

The budget minister of PERSON lied to the people in GPE about a hidden NORP account when he was trying to do something about the tax evasion. What is your reaction to that? And what will you say for public officials in terms of probity? Well, I am not aware of that and I will not comment on what seems to be an internal matter in GPE. So I really do not have a response. I have CARDINAL questions. CARDINAL, DATE, CARDINAL of minorities from GPE, including NORP, NORP and NORP, were demonstrating outside FAC. What they were saying, a message for the President that it should read that they are being targeted in GPE because of their race and religion and their beliefs. And whenever there is a problem in GPE and minorities are under attack by the extremists and groups. I do not have a specific response to the demonstration. Obviously, the administration and the President support the civil rights of peoples around the world, but I am just not aware of the specific demonstration or the issues in terms of a presidential response. And as far as guns are concerned, DATE CARDINAL of NORP were at FAC celebrating the Vaisakhi, their national holiday. And talking to them, what they are saying that among them were the families of the victims from GPE, GPE. What they are saying is that guns kill -- it does not matter how many rounds, and it should be banned at all completely, because as long as guns are in the wrong hands of the people, there will be -- people will be killed. And that is the message they were telling me to send to the President and to the ORG. The President's approach is one that embraces common-sense measures to reduce gun violence that do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the NORP people, Second Amendment rights that the President supports. And you have seen that reflected in the legislation that he supports up on ORG and in the set of proposals that he made and announced together with the Vice President DATE.

GPE will certainly be CARDINAL of them. Our relationship with GPE is and has been very important, and we continue to engage with the NORP government. I just do not have any particular next engagement to announce to you at the presidential level. The information also of the MONEY in aid for GPE that was announced in GPE, can you take that question and get it to us? Well, I have to take it. I am sure ORG would be a good place to go for more details about it. Back to the budget, if the President's deficit reduction plan is enacted, how many jobs would be lost under his plan as opposed to sequestration? The President's budget will increase job growth in GPE. It includes, in stark contrast to alternatives, investments that will create jobs. It includes tax cuts targeted to small businesses, for example, who hire veterans or small businesses who increase the size of their payroll, for example. It includes investments in infrastructure that will lead to immediate job creation as well as future economic growth and job creation because of the improvements in our roads, bridges, ports, and airports. So the President's -- it is an excellent question because the President's budget proposal, which contains within it his deficit reduction offer to the Speaker, has to be looked at as a whole because it is the President's CARDINAL priority to take measures that help the economy grow, that help it create jobs, that secure and grow the middle class, and reduce our deficit in a responsible way. And the whole point that he was trying to make, and I think he made very well in FAC, is that you can do that.

We want to be responsive to the people there. And I hope the statement will be taken well by the people of GPE as a genuine expression of regret about what happened. On another issue, there is a story now that a ORG pilot may have been shot down and may be held in GPE. Do you have any information that leads you to believe that there are NORP held POW in GPE? Well, I think the most I should say about this now is that in this particular case, and in this case only, I reviewed the evidence that we had, and we concluded that we should take him off the killed-in-action list and put him on the missing list, which means, obviously, that we have some information that leads us to believe that he might be alive. What does GPE do about it? Well, now that we have some information, we will begin well, we have already begun working to try to determine whether, in fact, he is alive; if he is, where he is; and how we can get him out. Because, since he was a uniformed service person, he is clearly entitled to be released, and we are going to do everything we can to get him out. If GPE was holding an NORP, they could not use it as an issue with GPE unless they let us know they had somebody. Why would they hold somebody and not let us know about it? Would that be to their advantage? That is why we did what we did on the classification.

And lastly, on a bit of domestic politics, do you think that Senators would have a good reason not to vote for PERSON for Attorney General because he blocked your nomination of PERSON? Well, first, I think that it was a terrible mistake by the ORG to do it, to do it on a strict party-line vote, which required them to get some NORP to change their position, including the other Senator from GPE, who had introduced Judge PERSON to ORG, and the Senators on ORG who had voted his nomination out positively to the floor.

You have written a lot of very interesting pieces on it. I just come in contact with it over and over and over again. So it is something that I am concerned about. He is spent a lot of time in GPE PERSON. But this had nothing to do with that. It was something that you said in the very end when we were talking last time, when we started talking about the loss of mystery and the fact that the distance between the leader and the public has evaporated during your time as President. And I understand the point that you made. Do you remember that?  I would like to make CARDINAL points. Number CARDINAL, I think that it is a good thing if the NORP people, through television or through journalistic writings, have a better, deeper sense of what a person the Presidency, for example not only what we are doing but why we are doing it and how it fits into the larger scheme of things and how it fits into the pattern of our lives. And you can get enough I think what you get out of the greater exposure and a more consistent pattern of exposure is worth as what you give up in majesty. What you give up in majesty?

For CARDINAL thing, the NORP do not have anything like the infrastructure or the stomach or the desire to do that that the NORP do. So there will have to be an actual abuse of power in office in some way that affects the public interest. We do not the guys that make money we have got a lot of rich people to support us. They would not do what PERSON did. They would not waste MONEY going on CARDINAL wild goose chases to try to run somebody down. We are just not that kind of people. We are actually interested in government, and we care more about what we do with power than power. So I think that is part of it. And I think shutting the ORG Counsel law down was part of it. Finally, when it finally was hijacked as basically the private property of the party not in the executive branch, I think its legitimacy was destroyed. So I think, if there ever comes a time again when we really need one, we will get it, the same way we got it back in DATE. The press and the public will say the only appropriate response is for the Attorney General to name someone or to ask the court to name someone that is clearly independent. Even short of those kind of spectacular, disgraceful, disgusting, awful kind of investigations, the Presidency after you the Presidency exists in people's kitchens. You have been living in our kitchens for DATE. Part of that is television and part of that is my predisposition to work hard in an open fashion. So I do not as I said, I believe the ability to share with the public at large what you are trying to do and why and to take everybody along on the journey is worth the extra exposure in terms of the price you give up.

PERSON in a very emotional plea in the ORG hearing DATE on gun control said now is the time. Can ORG tackle both issues at the same time? And which one will have priority? Well, there is no doubt that ORG can tackle both. We have to get comprehensive immigration reform. It is been too long since we reformed the system. And we are starting to see a bipartisan consensus built around this. So we need to take the opportunity and we need to do it fast. As the Senators do their work, start identifying where there is some differences. We can provide some technical assistance. Will one be easier than the other?

Both will end up generating some opposition and some strong opposition. But I am generally encouraged that the ORG seems to be having a serious conversation about these issues.

That even under our proposal, this is not a situation where overnight suddenly people all find themselves as citizens. They are going to have to earn their way to it.

And that is what we have done. But what I have also said is, let us make sure that we are applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity.

The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example. So we are making some changes there.

Apparently there have been CARDINAL countries who were asked to join that force and who have refused. Are you not concerned that GPE, by siding with GPE, is going to end up alone in GPE? I think that there was a not completely thorough statement of our meeting with Prime Minister PERSON. It was portrayed, and many people saw it, as somehow arriving at some new coalition with them, and even the word conspiracy was used by some in there. But, no, there was a reaffirmation by us of what our relationship with GPE has been since DATE. And we discussed this not from any standpoint of GPE and its relationship with NORP countries, in the sense of taking their part in anything of that kind. We are dedicated to the idea of trying, if we can, to act as a friend to both GPE and GPE in settling those longtime disputes and bringing about the kind of peace that we find between GPE and GPE now. I would have wished from the very first for a ORG force. But what has prevented it? If you look at the ORG force that is presently in the south of GPE, it is so bound by restrictions that were imposed in order to get the GPE vote that it literally is helpless to do anything. Well, I could still hope that GPE now would recognize the value of having a ORG force in there. And as I say, we would have preferred this from the very first, but it was something that could not be obtained. I was asking, are not you concerned of the growing reluctance of your allies to assume part of the burden in GPE? Well, we have been in communication. And I think that they understand better now, because we were just as forthright in talking to Prime Minister PERSON about our intentions in our dealings with GPE and the things that we were going to do in linkage with them. All of this aimed at being able if a mediator can be of use in that peace process that we proposed to ensure a fair solution to the problems. We have no plan that we are going to impose.

So, number CARDINAL, yes or no, did the President direct PERSON to write this memo on PERSON? No, the President had lost -- again, like I said, he'd lost confidence in Director PERSON, and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director PERSON go since DATE he was elected. But he did have a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General on DATE, where they had come to him to express their concerns. The President asked they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received. So it is ORG assertion that PERSON decided on his own, after being confirmed, to review PERSON's performance? And I think most of GPE had decided on their own that Director PERSON was not the person that should be leading the ORG, as evidenced by the numerous comments that we have seen from NORP members in the ORG and ORG, NORP members, members of the ORG, and people across the board. Since we are establishing the facts -- Senator PERSON said she was told something different directly from the President. The President said he asked PERSON and PERSON to review this. He asked them for their recommendation, based on the conversation that they had on DATE. He asked them to put that recommendation in writing. But they came to him on his own. And again, the President had lost confidence in PERSON from DATE he was elected. On DATE, PERSON came out and said that the President had full confidence in his ORG Director? Why did he say that? Look, I think -- again, he is questioned Director PERSON's reason for needing to stay at the ORG. He had countless conversations with members from within the ORG. Then why did the President -- -- and that is simply not allowed. And somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, PERSON -- who everybody across the board has unequivocally said, this guy is a man of upstanding character and essentially the gold standard at ORG -- when you take an action like that, when you go around the chain of command in ORG, then you have to make steps and take action to make a recommendation to the President.

Until you said from the podium just now that the President lost confidence in him over DATE and DATE, we had thought that this was all PERSON's doing. When was it that the President lost confidence in PERSON? I think it is been an erosion of confidence. I think that Director PERSON has shown over DATE and, frankly, DATE, a lot of missteps and mistakes. And certainly I think that, as you have seen from many of the comments from NORP members, including Senator PERSON, they did not think he should be there, they thought he should be gone. Frankly, I think it is startling that NORP are not celebrating this since they have been calling for it for so long. Do not forget, and I have another one I need to ask you, too. To follow on that, you said that he made a lot of missteps and mistakes. Back at DATE, this President was applauding the ORG Director when he reopened the investigation into PERSON emails. So he seemed quite happy with him at that point. Well, I think the President's position. CARDINAL he was a candidate for President, not the President. Once you take over leading ORG that is very different than being a candidate in a campaign. As you guys all know, there is a very clear distinction between those CARDINAL things. I think also having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic just atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in ORG. Any person of legal mind in authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in ORG, particularly for somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, who has been part of ORG for DATE and is such a respected person -- when he saw that, he had to speak up on that action, and I think that was the final catalyst. The President is accused by NORP of trying to circumvent the GPE investigation by firing PERSON; he meets with the NORP Foreign Minister and the NORP Ambassador to GPE. He is accused of being NORP; he meets with PERSON Secretary of ORG.

And for them to try to attack him for doing his job, -- maybe they should spent a little more time doing their jobs, and we would not have all the problems that we do. ENTITY, is not it true that the President had already decided to fire PERSON, and he asked ORG to put together the rationale for that firing? When did he make the decision? He made the decision for -- the final decision to move forward with it was DATE. But I know that he is been contemplating it for a while.

I cannot speak for Senator PERSON, but I did speak directly to the President and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director PERSON go pretty much since DATE he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at ORG.

That was, I think, the final piece that moved the President to make that quick and decisive action DATE.

Can we expect more firings from ORG? Going forward, does the President want ORG to shut down what he is called a taxpayer-funded charade investigation? He wants them to continue with whatever they see appropriate and sees fit, just the same as he is encouraged the ORG and ORG committees to continue any ongoing investigations. Look, the bottom line is any investigation that was happening on DATE is still happening DATE. And, in fact, we encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us and we can continue to see exactly what we have been saying for DATE, there is no evidence of collusion between the PERSON campaign and GPE.

Frankly, I am surprised that it did create a divide since you have had so many NORP and NORP repeatedly calling for Director PERSON to be gone.

They value politicians who stick to principles rather than those who compromise. And you will not be surprised to hear that that is what I hear often from my radio listeners. If control of the ORG changes, as now appears likely, and it is brought about by voters who want to put the brakes on you, how are you going to govern for DATE? Well, first of all, you know, I think the only poll that matters is going to be on DATE. And I still feel confident that it is a very close race in terms of the ORG. You have got close races all across the country, including in your hometown. And a lot of it is going to depend on turnout. Having said that, there is no doubt that voters across the board, I think, want to see GPE work. They do not want games. They do not want posturing. They do not want business as usual. They want us to focus on them, on jobs, on the economy, on keeping small businesses open.

Everybody agrees that we have to get control of our deficits.

And what occurs to me, sir, is that while your approach has been an MONEY stimulus, over there they are raiding the retirement age, they are making CARDINAL in spending cuts, and they are eliminating CARDINAL jobs. Which begs this question, why is not that the right approach for us? Well, keep in mind, first of all, that they had a big stimulus program over the course of DATE. So actually, GPE has taken the same approach that we have, and most countries have taken the same approach, which is that in crisis when you had a complete collapse of the economy and jobs were being shed at a pace of CARDINAL a month, that it was very important to make sure that the government was able to provide a backstop and allow businesses to heal and recover. Now, we have done that over DATE. The question is, what do we do going forward? And our problem has not been as bad as GPE's in terms of debt relative to GDP. Our problem is a long- term structural problem that has to do with the fact that we have got an aging population, we have got a bunch of entitlements that are very expensive and are very popular. People like ORG, they like ORG. I think that those are pillars of security for people in the retirement age. And so we have to make sure that those are there for future generations, but we have got to make sure that we make some adjustments so that those programs are in place.

But DATE, middle-class families saw their income go down by PERCENT. During that period, job growth was more sluggish than anytime since World War II. So middle-class families have every right to be frustrated and concerned. And the answer is going to be making sure that we are doing what we have always done best, which is innovate, have a dynamic private sector that is investing in new plants and new equipment and hiring new workers. We have got to have a government that is lean and mean, but also making important investments that foster long-term growth. I already mentioned infrastructure.

We now rank 21st and 25th, respectively, in our math and science education. And we have begun addressing them over DATE. So for example, we took away MONEY that were going in the form of unwarranted subsidies to banks, and we have made sure that that money was going into making student loan programs cheaper so that more people have access to college educations. That is going to be critical for our long-term growth. I will say, this is an example of the choice that we confront in this election, because my colleagues on the NORP side right now have said that they want tax cuts for PERCENT, the wealthiest NORP. And that would cost MONEY, and they have no way of paying for it. But part of the way that they are suggesting to pay for it is to potentially cut education by PERCENT. That is not a smart way for us to get our debt and deficits under control. We do not want to undermine those things that help us grow over the long term.

So we DATE have identified MONEY in cuts and wasteful spending. And you know, as I said before, part of what we have to recognize is that over DATE we had a brutal recession and a critical crisis that had to be addressed. And that did increase the deficit. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that we would have seen CARDINAL of teachers laid off, CARDINAL of firefighters and police officers laid off. This is not just at the federal level. It is also at the state level. We had to help them because their budgets were getting decimated by the severity of this recession. But having said that that, you know, that was a crisis moment that had to be addressed, what people are actually right about is that we have got to make sure that, moving forward, we are doing so in a responsible way.

You may have seen a PERSON cartoon; it showed you in caricature, and the caption was Or maybe you'd like PERSON back and another MONEY debt. How could we avoid that and make the whole economic climate healthier? Well, the first thing we have to do is to gain control over our economic destiny again. The deficit is spinning out of control. It was MONEY a year in DATE; it is MONEY DATE. The debt, as you know, has gone from MONEY to MONEY. And because of that, the money we ought to be investing has not been there. You can see that very clearly in GPE and southern GPE when you had all these defense cutbacks. We should have been reinvesting all that money in domestic technologies to put the people back to work here at home in high-speed rail, environmental cleanup, all kinds of other things. But the debt was so big that the money went to pay interest on the debt and into exploding health care costs. So our economic plan is terribly important to the people of GPE and the people of southern GPE because it begins to give us some control back. Already, the fact that the plan is making progress has brought down long-term interest rates. I know CARDINAL lady who called you said her husband was in construction. Because we are at DATE mortgage rates lows, there have been CARDINAL new jobs come into this economy in construction in DATE. That is the biggest increase in DATE. Now, it is going to take a while to reach southern GPE, because that is one of the most distressed areas of our national economy. So you have got to bring the deficit down. You have got to do it in a way that is fair to the middle class, by making upper income people pay the lion's share of the burden. Over DATE, we still need to spend some money to try to redevelop the businesses, the communities, and retrain the workers that have been hurt so badly by defense cutbacks. So this is a good plan, and it is still the only real plan on the table.

But we can turn it around if we will do so with discipline and if we will stop the delay, if we will go forward now and pass the plan. ENTITY, you mentioned critics. Congressman PERSON, speaking for the NORP, claimed over DATE that the ORG NORP are going to agree to a tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend program DATE that will result in another version of the biggest tax hike in history. In a nutshell, by DATE, will the rich be taxed considerably more, heavily taxed? By DATE, if the plan passes, upper income taxes will go up, taxes on PERCENT of the NORP people; CARDINAL of the tax burden would be paid for by people with incomes MONEY. The tax on the middle class, in the form of an energy tax, would be phased in over a DATE period and would amount to MONEY a month for a family of CARDINAL with an income of MONEY, by DATE of the plan. By contrast, families with incomes of MONEY would be held harmless, and there would be an incentive in this tax program, for the first time, for people who work TIME a week but have children in the home and are still in poverty. The tax system would actually lift them out of poverty. But the most important thing from my point of view is that there cannot be taxes without an equal amount of spending cuts.

And let me just make CARDINAL other point. For anybody who has refinanced a home loan or refinanced a business loan or gotten a car loan, a consumer loan, a college loan at lower interest rates, a lot of people are going to in the middle class and even some upper income people are going to save more money on lower interest rates than they are going to pay in higher taxes.

There are all kinds of things in this plan which are very, very good for business, that the business community has been asking for for DATE.

And that increased productivity, increasing output per worker, the increasing ability to compete with countries around the world, that is helping things to get better. The second thing that is making things better is that this administration's serious effort to bring the deficit down has helped long-term interest rates to get down to their lowest rate in DATE, and that is leading people to refinance, freeing up some money, and we are getting some more investment. But I do not want to mislead anybody. If you look at southern GPE, if you look at GPE, if you look at some of the GPE that have been hit especially hard by defense cutbacks of all kinds and other economic problems, we are still going to have to have a very disciplined plan to invest and grow our way out of the problems of DATE.

In fact, if we could get some more growth in those countries, we'd be in better shape because we are not selling as much to them as we would be because of their economic problems.

From the perspective of NORP, yeah, there was a common, you know, phenomenon called driving while black - that you were more likely to be stopped particularly in certain jurisdictions. If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions do you think traffic stops were done fairly, the majority of whites probably would say yes because it is not something they experi-ence. It is not because of racism; it is just that it is not something that they see. We were able to work with the police departments and the state police in GPE and persuade them that they would be doing a better job policing if we just kept track so that we had data. And combined with training, suddenly those officers out there are more intentional about how they decide should I stop somebody or not. And the incidents of racial profiling went down. The same is true with a lot of these issues. If you have good policing - I guarantee you that nobody's interested more in good policing than NORP community or NORP community because they are more likely to be victimized, if they are in low income communities, by crime. And the task force that I have put together is drawing from police and faith community and civic leaders and activists - and what is been striking to me in the conversations we have had is - is that they are interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country.

GPE is a large, sophisticated country that has a track record of state-sponsored ter-rorism, that we know was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon, or at least the component parts that would be required to develop a nuclear weapon; that has engaged in disruptions to our allies; whose rhetoric is not only explicitly NORP but also has been incendiary when it comes to its attitude towards the state of GPE.

Let me just move out of the Middle East momentarily and then we will swing back. This is CARDINAL of the most isolated countries for DATE, ruled by a brutal, repressive military junta. We seized that opportunity. We engaged with PERSON, the Nobel Prize winner, but we also engaged with President PERSON, who saw that GPE was traveling down a dead end.

And there are all kinds of troubles in GPE; the experiment may go haywire. They may not be able to reconcile all the different ethnic groups inside the country; the military ultimately may not be willing to give up its prerogatives and its power. Now, we want to be on the side of those who can take advantage of that opportunity. I feel very confident, very good about the work we are doing there. But I cannot guarantee success because ultimately it is going to be up to the NORP people and NORP leaders to seize this moment. The Middle East, I think, is - is similar, but in some ways even more difficult. Because you have this counter-narrative in the Middle East in which a sizable portion of NORP extremists have been able to penetrate the imaginations of young people there; you have govern - governments that oftentimes are creaky, do not serve their people, are repressive; you do not have a civic tradition there. And so, you have to almost start from scratch in many of these countries. What we can do is to be opportunistic and find places where somebody's ready and willing to move forward and do everything we can to help - and GPE's a great example of that.
