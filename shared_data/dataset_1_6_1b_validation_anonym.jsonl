First of all, I would like to welcome once again President-the President of GPE to FAC, President PERSON. I have thanked him, and I would like to thank him once again for coming before the end of his term. No GPE President had visited GPE for DATE last time-the last visit we had was DATE. So I would like to thank him particularly. I did it earlier, and I'd like to do it formally. On behalf of all NORP, I would like to thank him for maintaining his visit after the serious events that have taken place in his country. And I have expressed our sympathy and our affection for-to all the NORP people. I have also explained the-this country's situation at this time, especially from an economic standpoint. The President of GPE knows how the situation has evolved in our economy. He showed interest for our country's economy. When the crisis started in DATE, and when I was already President of the Government in DATE, we went through very difficult times, and now we see that those times have been overcome in spite of some pending issues. GPE is no longer in a recession. GPE is growing; it is the economy which is growing fastest in the ORG. In DATE, we had very positive figures, as you know. And DATE is also positive for the time being, and we hope things will continue like that. We have overcome imbalances. And the NORP economy has bright prospects if it continues-we continue to have an economic policy to keep public accounts under control and if we continue to undertake structural reforms. We have also spoken about the elections in GPE, the process that has concluded with the DATE elections. And I told President PERSON that I will do everything possible to form a Government as soon as possible. I think that having had to rerun the elections for the first time in the history of GPE was bad news, but having to have a third election would be very negative, and it would affect the economy and also our credibility in GPE and outside . We have also discussed issues on ORG. We have talked about Brexit. GPE's position in the negotiations with the GPE will be constructive. I think that is what is reasonable and what makes sense.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministermarianorajoybreyspainandexchangewith", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters in Madrid, Spain", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-brey-spain-and-exchange-with", "publication_date": "10-07-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5828, "text": "We have also talked about the refugee crisis and the immigration problems and immigration for economic reasons. Obviously, we have a position, and our position is that problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and we think that they should be resolved soon-the issue of GPE, the issue of GPE-because that will help us greatly. And I have also told President PERSON about what I am doing at the ORG so the ORG gets involved in resolving problems at the point of origin. A young person who has no prospects in his or her country-who has no prospects to live in his country, who cannot have a dignified life-will do anything he can to leave his or her country and find something elsewhere. So problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and countries need to be helped. And we have to do it together with ORG. We have also talked about ORG relations. We have talked about PERSON, Morn. And I think things have been done properly with the consensus of most of NORP society. And that is very good for GPE, and it is also very good for GPE and for all of us who defend democracy, freedom, human rights, and security for people. Bilateral relations at this time are wonderful from all perspectives. GPE is the top investor in GPE-foreign investor. Lastly, we have also addressed the situation in GPE. We are optimistic for the future. And in GPE, we wish lots of luck to President PERSON because he is deploying great efforts. And we have also talked about GPE and the need to normalize the situation. So we have addressed issues which are very important for GPE and for GPE. And I would like to conclude by saying, anyone who wants to hear me, that President PERSON is a good friend of GPE's and a good friend of NORP. He is honest and a person that we have cooperated with very pleasantly. We would be very pleased if he came back to GPE. Well, let me begin by thanking Prime Minister PERSON and his team and the NORP people for welcoming us. It has been an extraordinarily gracious and warm welcome, particularly given the tough situation that we have had at home and my need to rearrange my schedule. I was hoping for a longer stay, but I thought that it was important to make sure that, while I was still President, I visited such an important friend and ally.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministermarianorajoybreyspainandexchangewith", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters in Madrid, Spain", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-brey-spain-and-exchange-with", "publication_date": "10-07-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We-I thought the Prime Minister summarized our conversations well. We meet here at a difficult, challenging time for Europe and for the world. We have a world that is integrating rapidly and presents enormous opportunities. But if our institutional arrangements do not ensure inclusion, if we do not coordinate effectively on economic and security issues, then it can present great dangers, both in terms of our own people feeling as if they are left-being left behind, as well as people from other countries fleeing bad situations, wanting to come here, or engaging in conflicts that create safe havens for terrorism and present future challenges to us. The good news is, is that the relationship between GPE and GPE is extremely strong and we have been able to work together on a whole range of these issues. I am confident that taking the approach that GPE has suggested on the Brexit negotiations, that that can be managed in a way that does not have an adverse impact on economic growth and opportunity for all of Europe, including the GPE, and will not have an adverse effect on the global economy. I want to congratulate the Prime Minister and the NORP people for the economic progress that is been made over DATE. It has been a difficult journey, but many of the changes that were taken are starting to bear fruit. And we still have more work to do, all of us, in improving the prospects for young people who are unemployed and creating more innovation and productivity and growth in our economies and making sure that those economies are broad based. So we discussed how we can do that on both sides of the Atlantic. We just both came from the ORG meeting in GPE, and I want to thank the people of GPE and ORG for the outstanding leadership that they provide on a whole spectrum of ORG initiatives, whether it is heading up CARDINAL of ORG's new joint task forces, the incredible contribution that is provided by the GPE and GPE facilities and the hospitality shown to our forces, the work that the ORG and ORG together are doing in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea.

And the contributions that GPE is making to training NORP military and police so that they can consolidate the gains that we are making against ORG have been critically important, and we appreciate that very much as well. Outside of Europe and the Middle East, we also discussed Latin America, where we have a shared interest, given GPE's roots and strong relationships throughout the Spanish-speaking world and given the fact that what happens in the southern CARDINAL of our hemisphere has a huge impact on us. We agree that GPE offers the potential of new prosperity and new freedom if managed correctly, the process of normalization between GPE and GPE. Our hope is, is that although it will not happen TIME, that it provides new opportunity for the people of GPE. Peace in GPE has been elusive for DATE. And the fact that President PERSON has been able to initiate these changes and forge a tentative, but very important peace deal, I think, promises greater prosperity and security for all the NORP people. We are jointly concerned about the situation in GPE. And our hope is, is that we can find a way in which all sides can come together, stabilize the Government, and stabilize the economy. And we want to be helpful, although, obviously, we cannot dictate the outcomes in GPE. Let me just conclude by saying that I definitely will come back as an ex-President, because GPE is beautiful. But-and I want to thank the extraordinary hospitality that is been shown to PERSON and my daughters when they have traveled here. They love it as well. So I think, as your children get older, they do not always want to spend time with you. But if you tell them, we will take you to Spain- -then it is a good way to bribe them and force them to spend time with you.

But we have got to do more than that. In DATE, CARDINAL States have actually lowered their standards to make it easier for their kids to meet the targets set by No Child Left Behind. That was that is a pretty perverse incentive when ORG say to themselves, you know what, let us lower our standards so that we have an easy time easier time passing those standards so that we do not get punished under No Child Left Behind . That makes no sense. They are graduating ready for college and ready for a career. To know whether our kids are on track to meet that goal, we need better assessments. Now, I want to speak to teachers in particular here. I am not talking about more tests. I am not talking about teaching to the test. We do not need to know whether a student can fill out a bubble. We do need to know whether they are making progress.

{"id": 5838, "text": "What No Child Left Behind says is that teachers need to be certified before they step into the classroom. Now, certification can be an important measure of the quality of the teacher, and obviously, we want teachers to be well-qualified. But when the quality of a teacher can make or break a child's education, we have got to make sure our certified teachers are also outstanding teachers, teachers who can reach every last child. And so what we need to do is a better job preparing and supporting our teachers, measuring their success in the classroom, holding them accountable. We are going to have to stop making excuses for the occasional bad teacher. We are going to have to start paying good ones like the professionals that they are. If we truly believe that teaching is one of the most valued professions in society and I cannot think of a more important profession then we have got to start valuing our great teachers. I do not know any teacher who got into it for the pay. The teachers who are here, you got into it for the kids, for the satisfaction of feeling like your passing on knowledge that these young people will use and carry on for the rest of their lives. So we need to reward you by letting you make more of a difference for your kids. give our best teachers more time to learn from each other, more time to mentor each other, more responsibilities in their schools. And to replace the baby boomers who are retiring in DATE, we are going to have to recruit a whole new generation of teachers, including CARDINAL new math and science teachers over DATE. So these are the steps we are going to have to take to fix ORG. And together with what we are already doing to make college more affordable for CARDINAL more students, I am confident these reforms will help us meet the goal that I set when I took office, which is, by DATE, we will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.

So, in short, this would not be an open-ended intervention in the NORP civil war. These strikes would not aim to topple PERSON or, by themselves, to effect regime change. Like many, I understand the public skepticism over using military force, particularly in this part of the world. The wars in GPE and GPE have left many NORP wary of further military action, however limited. But what the President is proposing is fundamentally different. Unlike GPE, we are not betting on the existence of weapons of mass destruction. In GPE, we have the undeniable proof that chemical weapons have already been unleashed with horrific results. The entire world can see the bodies. True, there are always risks that accompany the use of military force. That is why we are taking a range of responsible measures to safeguard GPE personnel and interests in the region, as well as those of our allies and partners. In this event, we do not assess that limited military strikes will unleash a spiral of unintended, escalatory reactions in the region. PERSON and his allies would be more than foolish to take on the forces of GPE or our allies. They know that President PERSON, throughout his presidency, has amply demonstrated he will not hesitate to defend our nation, our citizens, and our allies against direct threats to our security. The limited strikes that the President plans are necessary and appropriate, which is why they have garnered support on both sides of the political aisle. ORG and ORG leaders have declared their full support. Foreign policy experts from the left, right and center have strongly endorsed such action.

At the same time, the international community increasingly recognizes that this chemical weapons attack cannot be ignored. The ORG foreign ministers have called for deterrent and necessary measures. ORG has said the regime's attack requires a decisive action. ORG has met twice, and Secretary General PERSON has affirmed that the allies agree on the need for a firm international response to avoid chemical weapon attacks in the future. DATE, at the G-20 in GPE, there was unanimous agreement that chemical weapons had been used and that the international norm against their use must be upheld. We gained unequivocal public support for anticipated GPE military action from partners in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, and GPE joined together in a strong statement declaring that the PERSON regime is responsible for the attack and that those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable. In DATE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, and GPE have signed on to that same statement, and we expect more countries to add their support.

DATE, more and more nations are coming to the same conclusion. With all the attention given to the prospect of limited military strikes against NORP regime targets, I want to underscore that such action is by no means the sum total of our policy toward GPE. On the contrary, any such strikes would complement and reinforce our broader GPE strategy, which we continue to pursue with allies and partners.

Thanks to the generosity of the NORP people, we lead the humanitarian effort to save lives, having provided the NORP people more than MONEY worth of food, shelter, medical assistance, clean water, and relief supplies. In fact, some of the medical supplies used to treat the victims at GPE came from GPE. We continue to upgrade and increase our support for moderate, vetted elements of the NORP opposition in coordination with our international partners. We are building the capacity of local councils and helping civilian leaders to deliver essential services to those in need. We are helping the opposition better serve the needs of the NORP people. And, we are expanding our assistance to ORG to strengthen its cohesion and its ability to defend against a repressive regime that kills civilians with abandon. Limited strikes that degrade PERSON's capacity to use chemical weapons, and thus to kill on a horrific scale with impunity, can also shake his confidence in the viability of his relentless pursuit of a military solution. But, ultimately, the only sustainable way to end the suffering in GPE is through a negotiated political solution, starting with the creation of a representative transitional authority that organizes elections and meets the needs of the NORP people. A ceasefire and a political solution are also, as a practical matter, the only way to eliminate completely the NORP chemical weapons threat. That is why we continue to increase pressure on the PERSON regime to come to the table and negotiate. Notably, during our discussions in GPE, we sensed more urgency among key players to bring the parties to the negotiating table to jump-start a political transition. GPE shares that sense of urgency, and our intention is to renew our push for the ORG-sponsored GPE process following any limited strikes. Just as limited strikes would complement our broader GPE policy, so too would they reinforce our broader Middle East strategy. GPE will not take sides in sectarian struggles.

We seek the stability of a region that is vital to the energy that helps fuel our global economy. Countering GPE's use of chemical weapons shows that GPE will act to prevent some of the worst weapons in human history from becoming the new norm. It will demonstrate that GPE means what we say. It will make clear to PERSON and his allies-ORG and GPE-that they should not test the resolve of GPE.

With allies and partners, we continue to pursue a comprehensive strategy to prevent GPE from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including diplomacy, pressure, and increasing sanctions.

If we do not respond when GPE's close ally, GPE, uses weapons of mass destruction, what message does that send to GPE?

The bottom line is that standing up to GPE's use of chemical weapons advances our broader goals in the Middle East. Conversely, by allowing PERSON to act with impunity, everything else becomes even harder-from countering terrorism to defending human rights, from promoting peace to ensuring our energy security and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In closing, allow me to speak, not just as the President's national security advisor, but also as a parent, a mother.

Now, we are paying down our debt now. And if we stay on the plane that I asked ORG to adopt in the budget, we will be debt-free in DATE, for the first time since PERSON was President in DATE. Now, why should ORG be for that? In conventional terms, we are the more liberal party. Why should we be for that? Everybody in this room who is DATE, who studied economics in college, was told that a Government should always carry some debt. We were all taught that. Because we are living in a global economy. You look at what happens to these countries that try to hide their money; people still get it out. Interest rates are set in a global economy. If we get GPE out of debt, it means that all the NORP can borrow more cheaply. If the Government is out of debt, it means lower interest rates for businesses in this country, for home loans, for car loans, for college loans. It means more jobs and higher incomes. It means when our friends overseas who are not as fortunate as we are get in trouble the way the NORP did in DATE, they can get out of trouble at lower cost. I believe, if we do this, it would do more than anything else we could do to guarantee a whole generation of prosperity. Whatever happens in the future, we know not DATE of DATE from now on will be as good as DATE have been, but whatever happens in the future, it will not be as bad as it would have been if we keep getting this country out of debt.

It is a great pleasure to have this chance to meet with you more as friends than as representatives of our countries, more for passing a pleasant TIME than transacting business. It is inspiring to look around this room, to think of the many languages, cultures, religions, and traditions that are present here TIME. Some might say this gathering is a microcosm of the problems that the world faces but to me this gathering is a sample of the opportunities we have to communicate on a personal level and to cooperate as representatives of our independent nations. This room is occupied by men and women aware of their responsibilities and respectful of the obligations of others. Those responsibilities and obligations are at times in conflict, but our commitment to civility and the proper discourse between nations should never waiver.

As long as our governments stay in touch with the hopes and aspirations of our people, the prospects for world peace will be strong.

PERSON, an NORP traveler and philosopher, once said, A man's feet must be planted in his country, but his eyes should survey the world. Well, this is the vision required of each of us and of every world leader. We must uncompromisingly represent the interests of our countries, yet be ever mindful that by our actions, we are determining the future of mankind. In the conduct of your duties, be diligent; in the search for peace, be bold.

In DATE, diplomats from CARDINAL countries have been victims of terrorist attacks. Fortunately, most have survived those attacks; a few, tragically, have not. Those who perpetrate these dastardly acts should never doubt that every nation considers an attack on any diplomat as a crime against mankind which will not be tolerated in any land.

Some of you are law enforcement officers. Some are civilians who work for victims' rights. Some are fighting obscenity and the unspeakable evil of child pornography. Others are working to prevent drug abuse. In DATE, I have heard a lot of talk-much of it, to put it most kindly, inaccurate-about our social agenda, particularly as it applies to the courts. Well, if anyone wants to know our true agenda, there is no need to go any farther than this room, because your agenda is our agenda. I do not need to tell anyone here the sad, often tragic story of DATE of judicial solicitation for every conceivable right of criminals and neglect for the victims of crime, of playing fast and loose with first amendment rights in a way that gave too many pornographers free rein, of fanciful constitutional arguments used to throw out long and hard police work, and of the price our nation has paid for all of this. CARDINAL way, for example, that we have paid that price has been in the wider and wider availability of pornography. The sale of pornography was once said to be victimless. But common sense should have told us all along that pornography has many victims-among them, children. I read a statistic recently that, in DATE, CARDINAL dial-a-porn company has received CARDINAL calls. I am told that the great proportion of those calls are thought to have been made by children. Let me mention here-and I have recently sent ORG a bill that will make it easier for law enforcement officials to fight obscenity and child pornography. But incredible as it may seem, there are well-meaning people who will oppose it. The most extreme say that the first amendment protects child pornographers as they publish and distribute their products. However well-intended, that kind of extremism should not be allowed to prevail. It is not what the Constitution requires. I hope I can count on your support in getting this bill enacted into law.

Judge PERSON has been on my short list from the very start. A graduate of ORG and ORG, he has served DATE on ORG. There he won the respect of his fellow jurists and the lawyers who practice before that court. He participated in CARDINAL decisions and wrote CARDINAL opinions. He earned the reputation for being a balanced and fair judge and one who is tough on crime and concerned about the victims of crime. Victims' dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system represents a failure of the system to achieve its goals. The significant criminal law decisions of ORG focused on the relation of the accused to the state, and the police as an instrument of the state. Little or no thought was given to the position of the victims. Well, that is a note of compassion and realism that is too often missing in our courts. Realism runs through all his work on the bench. He argued in CARDINAL dissent, for example, for a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, and saw his position ultimately adopted by ORG. That was in a drug case, by the way. And for realism about police work, the opinion he wrote in that case sets a high standard. You do not have to read many cases involving illegal drug traffic before it becomes clear exactly what was going on at the residences described by the officer's affidavit. Whatever the merits of the exclusionary rule, its rigidities become compounded unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct when the only commonsense explanation for it is ongoing criminal activity. Another example of his realism-DATE Judge PERSON upheld a lower court when it imposed the maximum sentence allowed by law against a child pornographer. His opinion focused on the severe psychological harm victims of child pornography endure and the great likelihood that child pornographers will, when released, commit the same crimes again. We need more realism like that on the Nation's highest court. We need Judge PERSON on our highest court. But let me add another thought here. The Constitution itself is tough on crime; it was intended to establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility.

And the ladders of opportunity for folks who want to work their way into the middle class are not as robust as they used to be. And what I said in the State of the Union was that we have to be focused like a laser on building back up an opportunity society in which everybody feels like if they work hard and if they are responsible, they can get ahead. And that means more jobs; that means making sure people are trained for the jobs that are out there. It means making sure kids get a world-class education. It means that work pays and that not only are they getting a decent paycheck that can support their families, but that they have got retirement security and health care security and all the things that give them a stable platform to live their lives and make sure their kids succeed. So we are doing that. And I have also said that ORG may not be willing to break gridlock during DATE. I am going to look for every opportunity to work with them.

Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what is necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member.

So when that bridge collapsed-and it was QUANTITY off the-CARDINAL-almost CARDINAL-I do not -I did not -I do not know the exact, but probably from down to the creek that it went over and the ravine, probably QUANTITY. When it collapsed, instead of a bus with a couple people on it-being packed with school buses full of children, the people on their way to work on the bridge that is one of the busiest bridges-you know, there are more bridges in GPE than any other city in the world; with the CARDINAL rivers-the bridge was empty, relatively empty. Fortunately, no one was killed, but for a snowstorm. Just imagine the challenges we face and the opportunities to build a better GPE, and extend it far beyond roads and bridges now that we can-know we have to do. We passed that infrastructure bill.

And I said on that night that this was not the end, but rather, it was the beginning. Because what we understood even then was that our country had reached a crossroads. That we had a series of decisions that were going to help determine the future not just of our children, but our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. That we were living in an age in which the world had shrunk; it had become more interconnected than ever before. And that if we did not make some critical decisions now, if we stopped just kicking the can down the road, but we decided that we were actually going to seize the moment and transform our education system and finally fix our health care system and deal with our energy policy so that we were no longer subject to the whims of the spot oil market, and if we did not transform our foreign policy to recognize the visions and dreams of CARDINAL of people around the world who were yearning to be free--if we did not make some fundamental changes, that we might be the first generation that was passing on an GPE that was less hopeful, that was less generous, and that all those people who felt the NORP Dream slipping out of their fingers, that somehow that loss of hope would continue.

And there are families all across the country that are still suffering from the aftershocks of that. And in some cases, the actions we took were not always popular. But we knew that it was vital for us to act boldly and swiftly to address the crisis. And let us take a look at what we were able to accomplish. An economy that was shrinking by PERCENT has now grown for DATE. An economy that was shedding jobs DATE now has seen CARDINAL jobs created just in DATE. An auto industry that some had written off now are making profits again and have hired back all their workers. We got the economy moving in the right direction.

We decided that we did not want equal pay for equal work to be just an empty slogan, so we strengthened laws to make sure that our daughters are treated as well as our sons. We decided that in a nation as wealthy as ours, it was unacceptable for people to go bankrupt just because they got sick. And so after DATE, we finally delivered on the promise of making sure that we had affordable, accessible health care in this country for all people. We made record investments in clean energy, record investments in basic research, and restored science to its rightful place. We made the largest Federal investment in education in our history, but we did not just put more money in. We decided we were finally going to deliver on reform and help catalyze reforms in CARDINAL GPE all across the country to make sure that schools are doing right by every single student, K through 12. And we also made sure that young people are able to afford to go to college, so we took away MONEY of subsidies that were going to banks and put those in the student loan system so that CARDINAL more young people were able to go to college without taking on MONEY' worth of debt.

And in between, we have dealt with pirates and-- --do you remember? Remember pirates-- --H1N1 and an oil spill and locusts? And I could not be prouder of our record over DATE. Promises were made during the campaign, and so many promises have been kept. And yet, all across GPE, folks are still struggling. We have been able to avert the worst possible crises, but a lot of those challenges that we confronted in DATE, those challenges are still out there. Wages and incomes have flatlined for the middle class all across GPE. The rates of poverty in too many communities are way too high. In too many schools, too many of our children still drop out without hope, without vision for the future. We still do not have an energy policy in this country that is equal to our potential and our greatness. And we are still vulnerable to high gas prices that are just killing families all across GPE right now. We still have not reformed our broken immigration system. So we have too many people living in the shadows, being exploited by workers, driving down the wages of workers as a consequence, because those employers are not subject to the rules.

Because what is at stake right now is not any particular policy; it has to do with a broader vision of where we want to take our country. I gave a budget address a while back, and a lot of people reported on the numbers and the debt and the deficit and why this is so important. And let me tell you, we as NORP, we as NORP, need to be just as concerned about the debt as anybody else. Because that is how we will be able to move our vision forward--investing in education, investing in infrastructure, investing in clean energy--if we have got a government that lives within its means. So we have got to be concerned about that. But this broader budget debate that is now carrying over and will probably continue all the way until DATE, it is also about what our vision of the country is.

We were proud members of ORG, but we did not like the fact that our party had been a part of the leadership of DATE of NORP Presidents when we had the majority in the ORG, and together they quadrupled the debt of the country; and that we were in a terrible recession.

Let me begin with a bit of history, and your chancellor mentioned it earlier, or ENTITY did. Shortly before-shortly after PERSON was elected President, Congressman PERSON, from GPE, asked his colleagues to help him create a system of land grant colleges. It was in the middle of the Civil War, and frankly, most of them thought he was nuts. You know, people were worried about the survival of the GPE. But PERSON was always worrying about other things, even in the middle of the Civil War. At TIME, when I work in FAC, I go to an office that I have had restored to the way it was in DATE. And I remember that that room was PERSON waiting room during the Civil War. And all during the Civil War, at TIME, he kept a time apart to meet with ordinary citizens. If you wanted a job in a post office in GPE in DATE, if you came at DATE, at TIME, you could walk up to the room that I go into every night, and sit there, and PERSON would see you; ENTITY would see you and listen to you tell why you wanted a post office job. And when he was asked why he did this, he said, I have to remember that people are concerned about other things, and I want this war to be over so all of us can go back to thinking about things like that. So he always thought about what life would be like when the war was over. And he was open to this. In DATE, PERSON's bill passed, and President PERSON signed it into law. It became one of the wisest investments our Nation ever made, and ORG, here, was one of the original land grant colleges under that Morrill Act. It is played a dramatic role in helping to shape our Nation. You heard and you were cheering about all the Nobel Prize winners and all that.

But he could not have imagined it. So that is what we have been trying to do. And you heard the Vice President say that basically our view was-the first thing we had to do was we had to get rid of the deficit, but we had to do it in a way that would enable us to invest in our future. We had to shrink the Government, but we had to do it in a way that would allow us to be more active in the areas that were important to our future, that would help to bring us together and widen the circle of opportunity. Now, as you look ahead, I'd just like to mention CARDINAL things DATE that I think the ORG can have a major impact on, CARDINAL directly and CARDINAL indirectly. First, we should look to DATE to try to speed the pace of scientific and technological advances in ways that benefit all of us.

I think it is highly likely that many of you who will be having children in DATE will have children that will live into DATE because of the work that will be done in places like ORG. The second thing that I think we should think about is we should reaffirm our commitment to the exploration of outer space. I talked a little about the international space station TIME and about Senator PERSON at DATE going back into space. It is so thrilling, and I know all of you are happy about that. But we are learning a lot from our work in space about how our bodies work here on Earth and about how our environment works here on Earth and how it might be better preserved.

They say that construction of power projects by local enterprise will impede the comprehensive development of this or other river basins. Now again--let us take a look at the facts. What they say just is not true. All power projects must be licensed by ORG. Before the ORG grants a license, it must see evidence that the project makes maximum use of the developed resources. It makes no difference who builds the projects-ORG, ORG, municipal, or private agencies. when a project is licensed before a ORG, it is not removed from public control. Rates and services remain under regulation. And when the licensing period ends, the site can be assumed by ORG. that, here in the Northwest, your own public agencies and your own private companies--operating under both ORG regulation and your own eagle eyes out here--can work in the public interest at least as well as some far-off NORP agency. Through ORG, Governors PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and PERSON are doing great work in assuring this area of adequate supplies of water. More benefits will flow from efforts to further inter-State cooperation on problems that cross the borders of the Northwestern States. I am especially happy that the power produced by this great new dam will contribute to the finest type of cooperative effort--your own FAC. This arrangement is an admirable modal of voluntary pooling of public and private generating and transmission facilities. Because of it, you citizens of the Northwest have QUANTITY of additional prime power that would not exist through independent operation of your various utilities. And in addition--and very important--you have it under your own control--not under the permission of a far-off GPE office holder.

We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked GPE, GPE, and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives. We have undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We have encouraged the NORP to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere. We have begun regular consultations with the NORP leaders as cochairmen of the prospective GPE conference to promote peace in the Middle East. We and our allies are negotiating together with GPE and their allies in the ORG nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe. We have renewed the DATE agreement for cooperation in science and technology, and a similar agreement for cooperation in outer space. We are seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger. In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on GPE accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists. The GPE negotiations of DATE left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation.

Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation. But none of these proposals that I have outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well.

I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, NORP and NORP, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our CARDINAL countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes.

We are destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations. We are taking out their commanders, their fighters, and their leaders. In GPE, local forces have largely held the line and, in some places, have pushed ORG back.

That is not in our national security interest, and it is not necessary for us to defeat ORG. Local forces on the ground who know their countries best are best positioned to take the ground fight to ORG, and that is what they are doing. At the same time, this resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility we need for unforeseen circumstances. For example, if we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ORG leaders, and our partners did not have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our ORG to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven. So we need flexibility, but we also have to be careful and deliberate. As Commander in Chief, I will only send our troops into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary for our national security. Finally, this resolution repeals the DATE authorization of force for the invasion of GPE and limits this new authorization to DATE.

So over at ORG, I met with folks behind the startup called ORG, which uses ORG data on weather to help businesses anticipate disruptions in service.

There is an app called iTriage, founded by a pair of ER doctors that uses data from ORG to help users understand medical symptoms and find local doctors and health care providers. And that is going to help launch more startups. It is going to help launch more businesses.

I think it is also accurate to point out that more than has ever been the case in the past, that professional nutritionists and their representatives, private citizens, consumer groups, have been involved in the preparation of this legislation. Another fact that I think would be undisputed is that in DATE, there has never been such a far-reaching and important piece of legislation passed relating to NORP agriculture. This is an important concept for us all. We are very eager to continue our preeminent position in international agricultural trade circles. Public Law 480, which permits us to dispose of NORP food products in a beneficial way, is enhanced. Foreign trade with the sale of our own agricultural commodities is enhanced. We have in this bill, too, a new approach to the food stamp question. This has sometimes been considered as an anomaly or an anachronism in a modern day ORG. But I think this legislation that has been included in the Food and Agriculture Act of DATE is a great step forward in providing a simple food stamp system and one that would be easy to administer, one that is more equitable, which eliminates the pervasive threat of fraud. I'd also like to point out that this bill includes many other features--a renewed emphasis and an enhancement of our research program in agriculture that is so important to every family. It, for the first time, makes a major step toward tying target prices to actual production costs. This has been one of the most controversial issues that the ORG has had to face. Obviously, because production costs vary so widely from CARDINAL community to another, and a bill of this kind has to deal with average prices or cost of production throughout the country, there still remain and will inevitably remain some inequities. But this bill makes a giant step toward tying target prices with production costs, and it also narrows its focus on individual commodities so that there can be more equity insured. This bill also sets up a means for maintaining adequate food reserves. Although we have been blessed recently with bountiful crops, we do not have an excessive reserve supply of crucial food and feed items on hand.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningintolawthefoodandagricultureact1977", "title": "Remarks on Signing Into Law the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-into-law-the-food-and-agriculture-act-1977", "publication_date": "29-09-1977", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5987, "text": "This bill permits us to maintain adequate reserves, and it also encompasses a provision that is very dear to me, and that is that most of the reserves will be under the control of farmers and that there is a very careful safeguard against the dumping of agricultural products on the market, artificially, to force prices down and, therefore, to damage the economy of farm families. We have moved in this bill to correct a very serious economic problem that exists among the farm communities of our Nation by increasing target and loan prices for the DATE crop. And I believe that this will certainly be a good investment both DATE and in the future. Another aspect of this bill that particularly ,appeals to me is the reduction of Government interference in the agricultural economy. This is always devoutly to be sought, and I think the ORG has very wisely achieved this goal in this current legislation. We have eliminated acreage allotments. Quite often in the past, acreage allotments historically have evolved into a financial measure of the benefit of Government programs, and they are bought and traded like actual property. This bill moves to eliminate those acreage allotments. We have also maintained an important element in the set-aside authority for the ORG Secretary. And very shortly now, set-aside regulations will be promulgated by this ORG. And I think the cost of this bill, because of its wise drafting, will be less and less as DATE go by. We have an exceptional case at the present time in agriculture, where additional expenditures are required. CARDINAL of the elements of agricultural legislation and appropriations which is often overlooked is that CARDINAL the costs that are normally attributed to an agricultural bill are actually in the form of redeemable loans. And this is not an expenditure from ORG; it is an investment in a very good and sound commodity. The loan is secured and the loans are repaid, but under our present accounting system, this is identified as an expenditure, and it tends to distort in the public mind the degree of ORG investment in agriculture. I'd like to close by saying that I am very proud of the good work that has been done DATE, and in DATE, by Senator PERSON, the chairman of the ORG committee and, of course, by PERSON and PERSON and all those NORP and NORP who've worked with them, both within the committee and on the floor of ORG.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningintolawthefoodandagricultureact1977", "title": "Remarks on Signing Into Law the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-into-law-the-food-and-agriculture-act-1977", "publication_date": "29-09-1977", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The Lausanne treaty and the treaty relative to the sale of arms and the use of gas did not come up for final consideration. The Railroad Labor Bill will we hope develop into a very important policy, because of the significance of it of leaving the management of the railroads and the employees to agree among themselves with the very manifest disposition of a new desire on their part to harmonize difficulties that may arise and adjust them without the interference of the Government. And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the ORG. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to ORG. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through DATE in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by ORG, a considerable step in advance. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in DATE as a result of conferences between the Secretary of ORG and ORG that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. I spoke of the CARDINAL treaties. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this ORG. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that did not have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the ORG act upon I secured favorable action. I happened to express it in that way. I think some of the success of the present ORG was due to the fact that they assumed very largely their own responsibility and undertook to function as an independent legislative body without too much interference on the part of the ORG or too much subservience to the wishes of the ORG. That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions.

As a NORP I am proud of it; and as an NORP I have learned from it. It only adds to the impact of this message that it closely matches notable expressions of conviction and aspiration from churchmen of other faiths, as in recent documents of ORG, and from outstanding world citizens with no ecclesiastical standing. We are learning to talk the language of progress and peace across the barriers of sect and creed. It seems reasonable to hope that a similar process may be taking place across the quite different barriers of higher learning.

In CARDINAL ways, the new realities of DATE have combined to intensify the focal role of the university in our Nation's life. First, and perhaps most obvious, the whole world has come to our doorstep and the universities must be its student. In the strange geometry of modern politics, the distant GPE can be as close to us as GPE, and GPE, itself, is worth more attention than we have sometimes given. Crises we did not create require our participation. Second, there is indeed an explosion of knowledge and its outward limits are not yet in sight. In some fields, progress seems very fast; in others, distressingly slow. It is no tribute to modern science to jump lightly to the conclusion that all its secrets of particle physics, of molecular life, of heredity, of outer space, are now within easy reach.

This also is the work of the university. And third, as the world presses in and knowledge presses out, the role of the interpreter grows. Men can no longer know everything themselves; DATE has no universal man. All men today must learn to know through one another--to judge across their own ignorance--to comprehend at second hand.

A final area of concerted action involves international financial institutions and their capacity to assist emerging markets in developing countries at a time when those markets could be under even more severe strain then some of the more wealthy nations and I think making sure that institutions like the ORG have the resources to provide such assistance that world food supplies are not imperiled as a consequence of the break down in global trade, those are all issues that I think have to be addressed. Now, I am confident based on conversations that I have DATE with PERSON, PERSON, as well as with PERSON as well as conversations that I have had previously with PERSON and others, that there is already a rough consensus there that by the time we arrive in GPE we will have taken, we will have made significant progress in moving in the right direction. Let us just talk about the stimulus for a moment. There are concerns among economists that you need a sustainable stimulus and therefore DATE is key.

What I have consistently argued is that what is needed is a both and approach . We need stimulus and we need regulation. We need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we are taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again. With respect to the stimulus, there is going to be an accord that ORG countries will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade. I think there is a legitimate concern that, would most countries already having initiated significant stimulus packages that we need to see how they work. Obviously, I admire economists. I have a bunch of them on my staff. But to start making a whole host of plans about DATE, without having better information on how the current stimulus efforts are working, is something that I think is of concern. So, what we are going to see is what GPE has led on this. We have been very aggressive in terms of our recovery package. The way our recovery package is structured, money is going out both in DATE and DATE. But each country has its own constraints, its own political rhythms and what we want to just make sure is that everybody is doing something, everybody recognizes the need to make progress on this front and that we are prepared to step into the breech should current efforts prove to be inadequate. I mean that is really the great challenge, in managing this crisis - bridging the gap between what is economically absolutely necessary and what is politically possible. How do you bridge that? Then there is a gap in ideas about how to approach a crisis like this, especially among economists - although on the issue of the stimulus there seems to be much broader consensus among both conservative and liberal economists that stimulus is appropriate. You know, the financial crisis hit GPE first; it is now being experienced around the world. Not surprisingly we took some very aggressive action earlier than some other countries because its impact had been felt most immediately on Wall Street. As other countries start experiencing these drastic declines in GDP and in their exports, I think that the sense of urgency has grown, and you are going to start seeing a convergence.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlionelbarberchrystiafreelandandedwardlucethefinancialtimes", "title": "Interview with Lionel Barber, Chrystia Freeland, and Edward Luce of the Financial Times", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lionel-barber-chrystia-freeland-and-edward-luce-the-financial-times", "publication_date": "27-03-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

So that is always going to be a challenge and what is also difficult is the fact that the policies we initiate all take time to take effect and by its very nature politics looks for more instantaneous gratification. But I am confident that the NORP people, and I think people around the world, are looking to its leaders to lead and that some of the steps we have already taken are starting to bear fruit. We are seeing glimmers of stabilization in the economies and we have not yet seen... Here in GPE for example, you are starting to see pockets of stabilization in the housing market. Our housing plan has led to the lowest interest rates, mortgage rates in a very long time and you are starting to see a huge number of refinancing in the banking sector. In certain select markets, like the market for auto loans or the market for student loans, Secretary PERSON's efforts to provide a market for asset-backed securities has helped and so we still have a long way to go, but I am confident that if we are persistent and we do not approach this with a thought that there is a silver bullet out there but instead are willing to try a range of methods to deliver on the economic growth in jobs that we will get out of this current crisis. You mentioned the risks and dangers of protectionism. CARDINAL separate measures have been identified by ORG since the last ORG summit so what again in practical terms can your administration do at the ORG to stop this - and I am thinking to whether there are real risks that people worry in Europe a lot about what is going on, on ORG, with Buy NORP provisions. Well first of all, I think it is important to note that here in GPE, despite some protectionist rhetoric and very real economic frustration growing out of the collapse of the financial markets and the huge rise in unemployment that the Buy NORP provision that was in the stimulus package was specifically written that had to be consistent with ORG.

That will put in a stronger position to help them.

It is important to have that sense of freedom as a source of vigor and strength, and a very important alliance. That is what I want to say. What are GPE and GPE going to do after the GPE, together? Well, we are going to work to fight terror. It is most evident here in GPE because we have been under attack, and we are still under attack. People still want to hurt us because of what we stand for.

They have got to be able to protect themselves.

Do you share that view, and are you going to go all out in this? I am going to go all out to try and get them the kind of aid that they must have.

I do not think it does rely that heavily on it. I think parents and educators would like to see some yardstick. So, we are talking about voluntary testing to show people where they stand. Is your school measuring up to this school over here? Is this school better in math and science than this school?

Do not tell GPE, GPE that they have got to do a formula like you have just mentioned, the same as a formula from GPE or GPE, GPE. It is not that kind of -- it does not lend itself to this kind of rote or mandate. CARDINAL, we have got to avoid legislative mandates. Secondly, if ORG, just by rulemaking and regulation, is burdening these communities, then I have got to do better in getting rid of those regulations that just tie the hands of innovative superintendents or teachers or shopworkers or whatever it is. GPE had a very good idea when they started reform in that GPE, was that any school district could apply for an exemption if they found a rule or a law that roadblocked them, and they would handle that. There are exemptions that can be applied for to the departments in GPE, and I think we have been able to handle some by exemption. But the big answer is to redo it, to start from scratch.

First of all, any unemployed, other than those who are voluntarily between jobs, is too much. So, I do not want to sound callous about that. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that is harder for me to do than to think of putting somebody out of a job. I came into the work force myself in the depths of the Great Depression. I saw what took place there. But unemployment is determined by CARDINAL telephone calls, like a ORG rating on a TV show, throughout the country-random. And the question is, Is anyone in the household looking for work? And on the basis of these calls and the percentage, the percentage of unemployed is determined. Suppose it is a housewife who says to you on the phone, Well, you know, the children are getting along now and if I could find something that did not interfere with family and was right, yes. Well, the person can put that down as she is looking for work, or the person from this end of the phone can put that down as no. Nor are we dividing between all those teenagers, that on the other end of the phone someone might answer and say, Well, my son would love to have an after-school job if he could find one, and so you can put him down unemployed.

First, it seems the message to Mr. PERSON from the GPE was, we want to see you withdraw from some part of GPE. First, what is the message to PERSON, if you could sum it up? Well, first of all, let us talk about what they want. I think what GPE wants is a peace process that moves immediately to final status negotiations and gives them a stronger sense of security. I think what the NORP want is a peace process that gives them a stronger sense of self-determination and possibility and dignity. So what we have tried to do for DATE now, ever since the GPE redeployment, we have been out involved in the region, talking to all the players that is not the royal we, I mean me, the Secretary of ORG, Mr. PERSON, Mr. PERSON, others involved trying to analyze what it would take to get the peace process back on track. And we have formulated some ideas and we talked to the NORP Prime Minister about them DATE; we are going to talk to Mr. PERSON about them DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmaraliassonandrobertsiegelnationalpublicradio", "title": "Interview With Mara Liasson and Robert Siegel of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mara-liasson-and-robert-siegel-national-public-radio", "publication_date": "21-01-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We have to work with the NORP DATE, then we have to analyze where we are with both and whether we can go forward. And we may not make any progress at all. And if we do not , I will tell you that. I'd like to ask you, though, after spending so much time with Mr. PERSON on this visit and on other visits, some people regard him as a man who always opposed a land for peace settlement to the conflict with the NORP, certainly would not have negotiated the GPE accords had he been in office then, has never liked them particularly. Some would say he is really trying to thwart that process and contain the damage from his standpoint. No, I cannot say that based on what I have seen. I do believe he is made no secret of the fact that he has principle differences with the GPE process, which he has pledged to support. And we all know he has a different political coalition, and that indeed, the political forces in GPE itself are different than they were even DATE in terms of the composition of the population, the rise of these small parties and immigrant-related intense groups and all that. I think that, historically, there is been a little bit of difference in the kind of the texture of the relationship between the ORG and the NORP and ORG and the NORP. But the bottom line is, I think, Mr. PERSON is an intelligent man who wants to make peace and understands that there has to be some formula where some marginal increase in territorial insecurity by giving up land is more than offset by a dramatic increase in security by changing the feelings of the people, the climate, the capacity for growth and opportunity. So we are just trying to hammer out what each side will have to do to take another step. ENTITY, in GPE, diplomacy has not worked yet.

It may affect the atmospherics, just, you know, the attitude about GPE. The main thing is every country in the region and throughout the world has a vested interest in seeing that no one who would either use or sell weapons of mass destruction especially chemical and biological weapons which could be carried around in small amounts, in little valises that no one who would use or sell them has a big program of them, which is why the whole ORG is against the NORP program. They need to think long and hard, these countries that have been a little squeamish about being firm, whether or not it is possible that they could be the victims of this, if not directly from GPE, from some group or another that GPE sells to in the future.

Well, I would favor doing something like that without committing to the specifics if we fail to get a global settlement.

I think there are lots of other things that can be done. And I think that we ought to have certain benchmarks of performance for the tobacco companies, too, which in my view will help because then they will be free to do more that they even have to spend a little more money than they are obligated to under the agreement if they are not meeting the targets, they may decide they ought to do that to save even more money down the road. So I am going to look for a global settlement in the tobacco case for the benefit of our children. If we fail, then I will look at something else. ENTITY, following up on that, you have cautioned ORG not to spend the surplus until they have it. Yet you have committed MONEY of some projected tobacco settlement bill before it is even passed to new spending. And if you do not get a tobacco settlement, are you committed to those programs?

Federal prosecutors reportedly rejected a plea bargain agreement not long ago with PERSON, with his lawyers at least, that might have guaranteed his imprisonment for life. Evidently they want the death penalty. Is it important to you, say, if he is convicted, that there be an exercise of the ORG death penalty? If he is guilty, he killed a lot of people deliberately, and, therefore, I think it is something that the jury should be able to consider. From my point of view, I approve of the laws that we have in GPE now, the sort of CARDINAL-tiered trial where you determine guilt and then you determine penalty, and I would want to hear all the testimony before I decided how I'd vote in that case. But I do think it should be presented to the penalty phase. Even if you had a guilty plea that as there is no parole in the ORG system guaranteed none and spared any possibility of an acquittal, you would still prefer to reject that plea, to offer the jury the option of the death penalty? I think the jury should have the option. Now, also, as a practical matter, there are not many inmates perhaps he would be one that actually do get life without parole. That is, in a prison system, where you do not want prison riots, you have to reward people who do an extraordinarily good job of being good inmates within the prison system, perhaps the practice of allowing people who have life sentences to be paroled after quite a long period of time is a good one, or, at least, defensible. But juries know that, too. But this was a case where, based on what I know, I would consider it appropriate to present that to the jury. ENTITY, on the NORP financial crisis, a lot of NORP do not understand why taxpayers should help bail out banks and investors in the GPE or GPE or in Europe who took a risk and made some mistakes. Do not they bear some responsibility? Do not they have to take some of the hit? They do bear some of the responsibility, and they should not all be bailed out.

But if we refuse on the front end to do anything, the problem is it could hurt us a lot worse than it could hurt the odd banker that does not get his money back, because if a lot of people start not getting any of their money back, then other people say, Well, I am going to get my money out, and then others say, Well, I am not going to put my money in ; and then all of a sudden the value of the currency goes way down. They do not have any money to buy NORP products and all their products are cheaper, competing against ours and other countries.

We have had periods of protectionism in our past and I am concerned about protectionist sentiment, because I believe that a world that welcomes GPE products and goods and services is beneficial for NORP farmers and manufacturers. In other words, if there is more customers for what we produce here in GPE, the better off the producers will be. It is also good for consumers that we have open markets.

I know the first thing that has to happen is the NORP we are using diplomacy, but it is the it is diplomacy of nations coming together saying to GPE with CARDINAL voice, 'Give up your weapons ambitions, and then you have a dialogue with GPE.' They know exactly what our position is, and they know what it takes to have a dialogue. My dialogue has been with the NORP people, and I am going to try it again right here. The NORP people have got to know that the that their government is isolating them, that their government's making decisions that are not in the interest of their country, and that this great country does not need to be standing alone in the world relative to the rest of the free world. This country is missing great opportunities through trade for people to embetter their life and the government if the government would change its polices toward development or gaining the know how on how to make a nuclear weapon it would be benefit the NORP people.

So it sounds like you are saying PERSON is trying to provoke a civil war. Well, what I am saying is that the NORP generally have not been respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of GPE. The question now becomes whether or not this can be deescalated and resolved in a way that gives NORP a chance to make their own decisions about their own lives. What I have said consistently is that each time GPE takes these kinds of steps that are designed to destabilize GPE and violate their sovereignty, that there are going to be consequences. PERSON's decisions are not just bad for GPE. Over the long term, they are going to be bad for GPE. Now, we want to give diplomacy a chance as long as ultimately the decisions are being made by NORP not by NORP, not by NORP, not by other NORP nations, but by NORP themselves. I know you have thought a lot about this, ENTITY. In your mind, is there a line never mind the color is there a line in Eastern Europe or GPE that PERSON must not cross? Can you articulate that for the world and for the NORP government? I think the world understands very clearly that GPE is a sovereign nation that has deep historical roots with GPE. None of us think that somehow GPE can ignore GPE, should be hostile towards GPE. Now, what we have said consistently is that we are not going to see a military resolution to this problem. But we do have a stake, as every country around the world has a stake, in upholding basic international norms and basic international rules. So what we are going to be doing is working closely with not just our NORP allies, but allies around the world and partners around the world, sending a strong message to GPE that there are consequences to this.

I have to tell you that everybody around the world understands the superiority of our military. And as commander in chief, I do not make decisions based on perceived signals. We make decisions very deliberately based on what is required for our security and for the security of our allies. The NORP understand that. They are not interested in any kind of military confrontation with us, understanding that our conventional forces are significantly superior to the NORP'. We do not need a war. What we do need is a recognition that countries like GPE can have relationships with a whole range of their neighbors.

Can you move forward on any of them without ORG, without the support of ORG? Well, I think there are a number of things we can do without ORG. As you know, we started back in DATE saying we cannot wait. And so helping families refinance their homes, we went ahead and did it administratively. Some of the changes that we are making on immigration, we are trying to make sure that we are prioritizing criminals. That the CARDINAL in CARDINAL program is something that we can change administratively so that families are not separated so long, when they have the opportunity to apply for citizenship. There are things that we are doing with community colleges, and on education that we can do administratively. But ultimately, we can obviously do a lot more if ORG is willing to move. There is no doubt that when it comes to jobs, our biggest priority is manufacturing. We are here at this ORG plant that is going to provide CARDINAL jobs here in GPE. And CARDINAL of construction jobs building this facility. And companies like ORG are not unique. What they are finding is they can be competitive here in GPE, but we have got to change our tax codes in order to provide even more incentives to invest in GPE. When it comes to NORP energy. There are a lot of things that we can do administratively, for example, natural gas. We think that we are going to be looking at CARDINAL jobs in natural gas extraction here in GPE and all the industries that come with it. But we could be doing more if we are investing in clean energy. So on each of these areas, making sure that we are building the skills of NORP workers, making sure that we are encouraging NORP manufacturing. Making sure that we have got a strong NORP energy program. That we can do some things administratively, but ultimately ORG, which has the power of the purse, is going to have to act as well. Unemployment is PERCENT among NORP, much higher than the national average. What can you say to NORP? And what can you do for NORP who are looking for jobs?

That is one of the reasons why we are going to continue to encourage refinancing, and we are actually expanding the refinancing program that we talked about DATE so that it can reach more people. And that should help shore up the housing market. And that could help create jobs. But we are also going to make sure that we try to push ORG to fund infrastructure projects that put a lot of construction workers back to work all across the country. NORP are just unfortunately represented when it comes to small businesses. And so one of the things that we want to do is to continue to get more effective financing programs to small businesses and startups, because they create most of the jobs here in GPE. So everything that we do is designed to help GPE as a whole grow, but there are certain industries that have been badly affected because of the housing crisis. NORP have been badly affected by them. If we can start helping those areas, then that is going to give a big boost. You spoke a lot about fairness in your speech. You mentioned the importance or the need for all to pay their fair share. Governor PERSON we know that recently said that he is paid PERCENT on CARDINAL income. Does he represent the inequities in our tax system? Well, I will let Governor PERSON speak to his own taxes. What I know is that as a general rule, those who are making the most in PERCENT or in the top one-tenth of one percent often times pay lower tax rates than their secretaries, or their drivers, or the people who are working in their homes. Now what makes it especially important is because right now we have got a big deficit. And we are all debating how do we reduce the government debt and the deficit, so we have a stable fiscal environment. We cannot reduce the deficit if people like me or anybody else who is making a lot of money are in a position where they are paying the lowest rate in taxes in DATE, even lower than they were under PERSON, lower than they were under PERSON.

He challenged you to CARDINAL or CARDINAL TIME debates. When are you going to respond to them? Well, I will let them determine who their standard bear is going to be. Until the NORP have a nominee, we do not have a campaign. Right now they have to decide who it is that they want representing them. Who will be a more challenging contender for you? You know, I do not really think about that. What I can say is this. That whoever their nominee is, they represent ideas that I think are wrong for GPE. They believe that we should not provide a pathway to citizenship for young people who were brought here when they were very young children, and are basically NORP kids, but right now are still in a shadow. They have said that they would veto the Dream Act.

And it is not the bold generous forward looking optimistic GPE that I think built this country. NORP are also criticizing you saying that you are campaigning instead of governing. Now as an incumbent, you have the right to campaign for your re-election. But how will people be able to differentiate between your campaigning and your governing?

And you know, my general instinct is to focus on doing my job because my attitude is, if I am doing my job well, people will recognize it, and the politics will follow.

They were fooled into buying homes that they could not afford. And so we have had to, for example, appoint PERSON as the head of ORG that we have setup. And I want to build a case as to why that is important. Because for NORP families it is very important to make sure that they are not cheated when they are purchasing a home. It is very important that when they send remittances to GPE that somebody is not taking too much of their hard-earned paychecks. So those are the kinds of fights that we are going to have. And you know, some people may interpret that as campaigning. I consider that to be important to my leadership in governing this country.

That even under our proposal, this is not a situation where overnight suddenly people all find themselves as citizens. They are going to have to earn their way to it. And they are going to have to go to the back of the line. We are going to have to clear out the, you know, existing lines, the backlog that we have in terms of legal immigrants.

Also, would parents of GPE born children who have been deported be able to come back under your plan? Well, what I am going to do is allow the ORG to work on these details. I do not want to, you know, fill in all the blanks. Because otherwise I would have gone ahead and put a bill forward. And then sometimes that creates a dynamic in ORG where if I am for it, then maybe some people have to be against it.

Now I know that you have reduced, this is another concern on Twitter, the number of deportations of non-criminals. However, in DATE CARDINAL non-criminals were deported. In the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? This is not about policy. It is about people. Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I am not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I am required to follow the law. And that is what we have done. But what I have also said is, let us make sure that we are applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That is the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example. So we are making some changes there. With respect to deportations until we get comprehensive immigration reform. That is one of the reasons I think it is so important for us to go ahead and get this action done. And keep in mind that if we are able to say, at DATE, or maybe even before DATE, that we have gotten comprehensive immigration reform done, then that then empowers me to deal with many of these issues in a way that I think, to allow the more specific issues that a lot of people I think would like to see resolved. If you had to choose, what would be the concessions that you would be willing to make on immigration reform? And what would be completely unacceptable to you?

So we are going to redouble our efforts to recruit talented and gifted NORP that come from every walk of life. It comes from academia, it comes from elected officials. It comes from foundations and non-for profits. Maybe some will come from the media. And we want to identify as much talent as possible.

They say that we are bringing fewer criminal prosecutions in the Federal courts for violations of the gun laws than were being brought DATE. The truth is that prosecutions for violations of the gun laws are increasing in GPE. But we have a partnership between the ORG prosecutors and the ORG prosecutors. And more of the minor cases are being brought at the ORG level now, and the major multistate cases are being brought at the ORG level. But let me say, the more important thing is why is PERSON saying this? Because he does not want us to do background checks when people buy guns at gun shows or at urban flea markets. He did not want us to do background checks when people bought handguns in gun stores, and they said it would not do any good. But we know that CARDINAL people, because of a criminal background, could not buy guns under the Brady bill. We know we have got the lowest crime rate and the lowest murder rate in DATE.

{"id": 1947, "text": "And what incentives can you offer them that are not in place right now? We can offer them tax credits, and we can offer them loan guarantees. And we can offer them modest expenditures of public funds to support these kinds of investments. They will make a big difference. For example, if let us just take a poor neighborhood in GPE or GPE or even here in GPE, where there is a very large NORP population. Let us suppose that we wanted to have a MONEY investment. Under this proposal, if my bills were to become law, they could put MONEY in equity, and they would get a PERCENT tax credit. They could borrow MONEY and have it under a ORG loan guarantee, which would dramatically lower the interest rate. So you would say, okay, you are taking a little bit of a risk investing in a poor area, but we will cut the risk way, way down. Yet a disproportionate number live in poverty, do not have health care, and cannot get a job. Why has the NORP dream eluded them? Well, let me start with the positives. We also have more successful NORP in GPE than ever before, more people like you and the people that work for ORG. We have the lowest unemployment rate we have ever recorded, and we started keeping separate NORP unemployment rates in DATE. Number CARDINAL, a lot of the NORP population of GPE are recent immigrants. Recent immigrants always have more problems with health insurance and with employment. They have not very often mastered English; they often do not have the right contacts. So part of that is inevitable. But there are some other things that I'd like to point out. Because of the family traditions that have been so strong in NORP families, very often the children would leave school early to go to work. And that worked for generation upon generation of NORP families, the people that had been here for DATE. It does not work anymore because if you drop out of high school, your chances of getting a good job with a growing income are very, very small. And the biggest separate social problem we have with NORP in GPE DATE is the dropout rate from school is way too high.

I am very concerned about the combination of the narcotraffickers and the people that have been engaged in the civil war down there totally destabilizing GPE. They have already hurt the economy. They have divided the society. They have weakened the country and its government. And it is a big, big country with enormous significance for all of Latin America.

They can find a way to do this if they decide that the price of failure is far higher than the price of compromise. And I think there is a good chance they will do it; even if it is TIME, I do. Their position has been that there has to be guns handed over, actual hardware, before ORG can go into government.

How concerned are you about what the impact of a refusal to let the NORP go down FAC could be, both on the streets and on the political process?

It is not just a matter of a lot of people walking on a certain road. And I think however it is resolved DATE, the most important thing is that the parties themselves try to find a larger, omnibus resolution for this that reflects the spirit of the Good Friday accords.

Now, a person I am not talking about whether somebody's robbed a bank or something like that, but I think that the pendulum swung pretty far over in the last CARDINAL or CARDINAL elections, and I think it is swinging back now. And I think that is what the voters are saying, and they will try to get it right. But something ought to be genuinely relevant, and we ought to not just target people for no good reason and just pound on them and use that because they could not win the old-fashioned way.

DATE you issued a written statement expressing deep regret for the deaths at FAC. But the word apologize did not appear in that statement. Is there a reason for that, that you drew a distinction between expressing regret and apologizing? Well, for me, now, other than that I told them to try to draw the statement up based on what we actually knew about the facts. And I worked very closely with or our people have with ORG. We want to be responsive to the people there. And I hope the statement will be taken well by the people of GPE as a genuine expression of regret about what happened. On another issue, there is a story now that a ORG pilot may have been shot down and may be held in GPE. Do you have any information that leads you to believe that there are NORP held POW in GPE? Well, I think the most I should say about this now is that in this particular case, and in this case only, I reviewed the evidence that we had, and we concluded that we should take him off the killed-in-action list and put him on the missing list, which means, obviously, that we have some information that leads us to believe that he might be alive. What does GPE do about it? Well, now that we have some information, we will begin well, we have already begun working to try to determine whether, in fact, he is alive; if he is, where he is; and how we can get him out. Because, since he was a uniformed service person, he is clearly entitled to be released, and we are going to do everything we can to get him out. If GPE was holding an NORP, they could not use it as an issue with GPE unless they let us know they had somebody. Why would they hold somebody and not let us know about it? Would that be to their advantage? That is why we did what we did on the classification. We have enough information that makes us believe that at least he survived his crash, at least that that is a possibility, and that he might be alive.

We are still running down some of the leads. We are still doing some of the work. I think that we will know, and I think that GPE will take appropriate action. That is, I have absolutely no doubt that President-elect PERSON will continue to pursue the investigation and, when the evidence is in, will take appropriate action. And when that happens, I will support him in doing so. And lastly, on a bit of domestic politics, do you think that Senators would have a good reason not to vote for PERSON for Attorney General because he blocked your nomination of PERSON? Well, first, I think that it was a terrible mistake by the ORG to do it, to do it on a strict party-line vote, which required them to get some NORP to change their position, including the other Senator from GPE, who had introduced Judge PERSON to ORG, and the Senators on ORG who had voted his nomination out positively to the floor. I am going to follow my policy here. You know, I will be an ex-President when this is done, and I do not believe I should be commenting for some period of time on public affairs, plus which my wife is a Senator. She has to vote on it. So I am going to let she can speak for herself, and the other NORP and NORP will speak for themselves. I do not think I should say more. I have known Senator PERSON a long time. I know he is genuinely very, very conservative, and that is what is in his heart. But I did not think this was about that, and it surprised and profoundly disappointed me. I thought that with DATE left, you might speak out with a little more reckless abandon than usual. Look, I need my Miranda warnings when I talk to you guys, you know.

And I was trying to pay a little homage to PERSON in his hometown of GPE, with a lot of his family and friends there, by saying you know, he did, I think, did a very good job running the Vice President's campaign. They did win the popular vote. We were having a good time. Again, let us look back at your DATE in office, ENTITY. After you were inaugurated in DATE, how long do you think it took you to get up to speed as ENTITY? Well, I would say there has there is a different answer to that depending on what the issue the question is. For example, I think that the issues that I talked about DATE when I reviewed our domestic record on social policy, I think we were ready from DATE. I think we were and I think part of that was the fact that I'd been a Governor for DATE, that I'd been through a tough economic period, had a clear economic philosophy, had worked on education and welfare reform and crime and the environment. Part of it was the fact that I'd had the opportunity to represent the Governors with ORG and the ORG on many issues. On foreign policy, I think I was up to speed on some things and had to learn a lot on others, and I tried to be a quick study. On the ways of GPE, I think it took us probably, you know, even as much as DATE, DATE, before we really had a good feel for some of the rather different ways in which the town works and the ways in which what a President does and says communicates itself to the other decisionmakers and to the larger NORP public in a way that was quite different than had been my experience as Governor.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollercbsradiodovernewhampshire", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller of CBS Radio in Dover, New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-cbs-radio-dover-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "11-01-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We passed the first big first we passed the economic plan, which included, among other things, the empowerment zones and the earnedincome tax credit and all the things that got rid of the deficit, as well. And then we passed the family medical law. We passed the Brady law. We passed the crime bill. We passed NAFTA. You know, we did a phenomenal number of things in DATE, substantively. But because of the whole sort of contentious atmosphere, some of the problems that we had with health care and other issues, I think that it was not as successful politically and I say that in the best sense politically, meaning we did not communicate as well to the NORP people or the other decisionmakers in GPE in a way that people could see exactly what was happening and that we were underway here. So I think it took me longer to get the politics right. I think it took a little while for me to get entirely comfortable with all the foreign policy and national security issues I had to deal with not too long. And I think we were ready on the substance of domestic policy from DATE. As we are about to inaugurate a new President, can the NORP people believe that its new President will be ready for the job on DATE, or do we have to give them a period for on-the-job training? Well, I think he is like any new President. I think he has certain strengths and will be ready in some ways, and I do not think any human being can be ready in every way on DATE.

Let me just back up and say, a lot of people believe that if the health care plan had been differently designed or something, it could have passed. The truth is that because of the combined effect of the condition of the economy and the inability to raise taxes, we could have neither an employer mandate or a Government-funded program sufficient to insure PERCENT of health care coverage.

I'd like to ask you as you near the end of your Presidency, sir, what do you think of the news media coverage that you have been subjected to? Well, first of all, that is also been in just a good-natured jest. It is true that I am on the way out. I mean, you cannot and so I have had a good time.

I think that there are unusual pressures on the media DATE because there are more competitive outlets, and I think that the net effect of that is that sometimes a herd mentality takes over, and CARDINAL person gets the story wrong, then everybody gets it wrong. I think that the pressure for market share has aggravated the tendency which already exists, not only in our GPE but in every capital in the world, to elevate politics over policy and discord over working together. So I think that I also think that as the first post-baby-boomer President, and given the fact that I was involved in my youth in the controversies over Vietnam and a lot of other things, I think I became kind of a lightning rod and PERSON did for a lot of things that the system kind of had to work its way through.

We have people involved in their own entrepreneurial efforts who are being frustrated. Part of it is seen as an unwillingness on the part of the NORP administration to target jobs to people in the NORP community. How would your partnership address that? It would do that in several ways. First of all, we are trying to make the NORP community more accessible to capital to start jobs. CARDINAL real problem we have in GPE is that once areas get high unemployment rates and people leave it, do not invest there, it is almost impossible to get loans to start businesses and to begin them. PERSON, a Congressman from GPE, has been particularly active in working to help to set up a new network of development banks around the country so that we can get money, capital, into these areas to start businesses.

And that will become a short-term boost in a lot of our cities throughout the country. Over the long run, what we have got to do is get investment there. And the last thing I want to point out is that we really worked hard to increase the capacity of people in the inner cities to get the training they need to take the jobs that are opening up.

There are a number of poor people and single mothers in our listening audience who feel demonized when the subject of welfare reform comes up, because it appears as though they are being stereotyped in terms of not wanting to work, not wanting to find a job, et cetera, when it has been the experience of many people in our community that this is not the case, that many people on public assistance want desperately to find jobs. Tell us how your welfare reform program would speak to this seeming demonization of single mothers and the poor. Well, first of all, let me say I agree with what you just said. CARDINAL of the things that I try to say every time I mention this issue is that the people who most want relief from welfare dependency are the people who are on welfare.

We also have lowered taxes on workers with children who work full-time for very modest wages so they will not be falling back into poverty, there will not be an incentive to go back on welfare if they get a job. Now, the trick is going to be how to create enough jobs for people to get them. That is, once you train people for work and once you say that after DATE they have to go to work if they are not, then there have to be jobs there available. You either have to have some sort of incentive for the private sector to hire more people, or people have to go to work in public jobs, community service jobs. And we are working on both. I just approved I have approved CARDINAL experiments in CARDINAL separate GPE to try things to put people from welfare to work. And the State of GPE has just gotten permission from our administration to actually give welfare checks to private employers as a supplement, and then the employer puts in some pay over and above that. And the idea is that the private work force will grow a lot more because of this extra incentive, and the welfare recipient will get more money than would have been the case just drawing the welfare check by going to work. So we are doing a lot of things in an experimental way right now to try to make sure we have the jobs there, because I am convinced that almost all people on welfare, given the proper training and knowing that their children will not lose their health care coverage, will gladly choose work over welfare. I agree with that, ENTITY. I wanted to ask another question, a little broader, moving away directly from the economy for a moment.

Do you think during DATE we have continued it? so far as I have known the facts I have given them responsively to every question, and where I thought the national security was involved, I was honest enough to say so. I meant, did you feel that reporters had been fair to you, too, in their questions? Well, when you come down to it, I do not see what a reporter could do much to a President, do you? Could you expand a little more on your ideas about a constitutional amendment on the reelection of the President? Do you have any particular dates in mind when the election should be held or Well, I am going to be talking, as I warned someone DATE, much more in the future than I thought I would; so, I am going to put these ideas out. I do not mind giving the general idea that I just did, but I would not want to put the details and dates right down until I had studied them completely through in this way. But I do think that a President ought to have the task of completing and finishing his Budget Message, his Economic Reports, and recommendations, and his State of the Union Message during a period while he is still responsible. So we can give him a period in which he is responsible for that, before you go before the ORG. Because now the old President has got to put these things in and the new President has different ideas, he just has to start changing them right away. It seems a little bit silly to me. I wonder if you could tell us for the historical record, this has come up a number of times, could you say whether at any time you advised or counseled Vice President PERSON against engaging in televised debates, and whether you felt that you, your participating in the campaign began as early as it should have?

The big disappointment I felt is one not of a mere incident, it was the fact that we could not in DATE get to the place where we could say it now looks as if permanent peace with justice is really in sight. But, on the other hand, if you take achievement over the long run, let us remember what has happened in DATE. Our opponents achieved the nitrogen hydrogen bomb. They began to build up an arsenal which, of course, we know is QUANTITY in expressed power, in its power; and at the same time during those days we were already fighting CARDINAL war, there was danger that there was going to be a spread of those hostilities. During DATE, I think, NORP were constantly threatening war, saying they were and they were not only threatening, but often making moves in that direction and at the same time the NORP were saying, We are going to support our NORP allies. Now, there was I believe in this in the governmental actions of DATE, the kind of understanding and firmness and readiness to take the risk that prevented those things from happening because I am perfectly sure that weakness would have allowed them to, and a display of weakness, and I mean either moral or physical would have allowed them to spread this war to the great and disastrous consequences of all the earth. So, the achievement I think, CARDINAL of the achievements has been that we actually have stopped many of these risks from becoming realities, and on the other hand the disappointment is that we have not done better in getting a more constructive and positive indication that real disarmament is around the corner.

{"id": 2008, "text": "There are CARDINAL key elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. That is why I believe the first thing any tobacco legislation must include is a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. These penalties should be non-tax-deductible, uncapped, and escalating to give the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting children as new customers. CARDINAL of the surest ways of reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Today I call for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by MONEY a pack over DATE, as needed, to meet our youth reduction targets. And I call upon the ORG to follow the lead of ORG and repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a MONEY tax credit. Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the ORG to regulate tobacco products. I believe the ORG's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as strong and effective as its authority over drugs and devices. In particular, legislation cannot impose any special procedural hurdles on the ORG's regulation of tobacco products. Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable, especially in any efforts to market products to children, while insisting on changes in the way it does business. I ask the industry again to make a voluntary commitment to stop advertising to children. And I call upon ORG to pass legislation providing for broad document disclosure so that the public can learn everything the tobacco companies know about the health effects of their products and their attempts to market to our children. Fourth, Federal tobacco legislation must aim not only to reduce youth smoking but to meet other health goals as well. These include the reduction of secondhand smoke, the expansion of smoking prevention and cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other important health objectives. We must build on the bipartisan agreement to fund children's health care in the recent balanced budget. And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities. We know that tobacco farmers are honest, hardworking people, most of whom live and work on small, family owned farms. In some GPE, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must protect these farmers, their families, and their communities from loss of income.

And finally, let me say again, we would not be here if it were not for all the people in this room and the countless others they represent around the country. To me, this is not about money. It is not about how much money we can extract from the tobacco industry. It is about fulfilling our duties as parents and responsible adults to protect our children and to build the future of this country. We are doing everything we can in this administration to give parents the tools they need to raise their children, but parents have to be our partners as well. If this is not just about money, we have to recognize that even beyond the tobacco companies and all of us in this room, every parent in GPE has a responsibility to talk to their children about the dangers of tobacco, illegal drugs, and other things that can hurt them.

CARDINAL of things we are very excited about is we set up a Presidential commission with CARDINAL active groups on everything from energy to high-tech. And I recently extended an invitation to President PERSON to visit GPE in DATE. And one of the things we hope he is going to be able to do is not just visit GPE, but also travel, for example, to Silicon Valley and see how the connections between universities and venture capital and business has been able to create some of the extraordinary inventions that all of us use DATE. Now that you mentioned the START Treaty, when are we going to ratify it? My hope is that we ratify it DATE on our side and---- Well, I'd like to see it happen before the election. Obviously, it is technical, and I think it is appropriate for the ORG to examine it, but we are going to be putting forward the text of the treaty, the annexes, all the necessary materials before the ORG in short order. And our hope is, is that they will be able to review it quickly and recognize that this is an important step in the efforts of both GPE and GPE to meet our obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to lower our stockpiles, at the same time as we work together to hold other countries accountable on obligations regarding the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Well, that was the point actually of signing the treaty, to save money and also to convince the rest of the world.

That principle has been embraced by a lot of countries. And there are countries like GPE, for example, that had gone fairly far down the path of developing a nuclear weapon and decided this did not make sense for us. GPE and GPE are CARDINAL outliers, countries that have insisted on flouting international rules and ORG ORG resolutions, are not cooperating the way they need to with the ORG. And so I have been very heartened by the cooperation that we have seen so far between GPE, GPE, the other members of the P-5-plus-1, in terms of imposing the kinds of pressure and sanctions that are necessary to get GPE to choose a more responsible path that will lead it back into the heart of the international community. Having signed the treaty, and having carried out several other things within the reset framework agenda, we have achieved a better mutual understanding. How can you convert it into something of a substance in such particular area as NORP security? Because also, ORG is a solution for those countries which are in, but ORG is not a solution for self-sufficient countries like GPE. Well, President PERSON has put forward some ideas about a new security architecture in Europe. We are examining them. I take them very seriously. But I think that the most important thing at this point is to work with the institutions we have to see if we can rebuild the trust that for some time had been lost. So, for example, I have been supportive of ORG-Russia consultation in a much more systematic way than has been observed over DATE. My sense is, is that all the parties in Europe, all the members of the ORG alliance, want to have a strong, cooperative relationship with GPE. a respect for territorial integrity of internationally recognized borders, a belief that a country's core sovereignty includes its ability to choose how it allies itself, a rejection of the notion of spheres of influence, whether it is GPE spheres or NORP spheres or NORP spheres.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsergeybrilevrossiyatv", "title": "Interview With Sergey Brilev of Rossiya TV", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sergey-brilev-rossiya-tv", "publication_date": "06-05-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

My basic principle is to focus on the fundamentals of the economy. We have a market-based mechanism for determining the value of currencies. I think that if we have a strong GPE economy, we are going to have a strong dollar. And obviously, we have just gone through a very difficult period; the whole world has.

That is why I have said, and GPE is actively pursuing, the belief that the G-20 framework is so important, that we have to recognize that GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, all these countries that traditionally have been viewed as on the periphery of economic decisionmaking, they are now at the core--GPE--are huge economies.

But ultimately, the policy has to be what is best for children, whether they are living in GPE or they are living in GPE. What we have done is to set up a bilateral discussion between our ORG and counterparts in NORP to find out how do we create an agreement in which children are protected. And as the father of CARDINAL children, obviously, it breaks my heart to think about children who have been vulnerable, have probably already gone through difficult situations and then are subjected to even more difficult situations in the past.

I believe in civilian nuclear power. GPE is a sovereign country, and they should have it. The problem is, we just do not trust the Government because they have not been forthcoming about their enrichment of fuels to go into the reactor. And therefore, GPE's offer to provide fuel on a contractual basis and provide fuel on a consistent basis would help solve the problem. And that is, the NORP would not need to enrich; they would have fuel for their reactor; and the people would have cheaper electricity. And I support that idea. Sir, would you allow enrichment inside GPE if there are guarantees and international supervision? In other words, I- you know, once you-once a nation has not told the truth, it requires a lot of work to convince people that they will be telling the truth in the future. And my problem is, is that ORG has not been forthcoming, has not fully disclosed their programs like the ORG asked them to. And the better way forward is for there to be a contractual, solid obligation to provide fuel for a nuclear reactor, and then the NORP can have their civilian nuclear power. At a time when NORP are going through very difficult economic circumstances-there is high employment, high unemployment; there are high prices; there are unfilled promises-ORG just passed a new set of sanctions against the regime.

We are going to talk about how to continue to spread freedom and peace. We will talk about how to work the compassion agenda on ORG, for example. We are going to spend some time talking about that. I value his advice, and I-every time I visit with him, whether it be on the phone or on video or in person, I come away with a-some interesting ideas about how to advance a positive agenda. Secondly, I look forward to speaking to the people of your great country. I am going to have a chance to give a speech to talk about the importance of our relationship, the unique relationship between GPE and GPE. And I will have a chance to answer some questions, I am sure, from what we call the Fourth Estate here, the mighty media. I look forward to it.

It is in our economic interests that it is strong. It is in the interest of peace that it be strong.

Well, I think what we are talking about is the same old problem of inflation. I am not sure that that is the best idea, because we found out when we decontrolled gasoline, the oil prices, that the price went down, not up. It encouraged more exploration and more development at the source. And maybe the same thing would happen with natural gas, but no decision has been made on that. But the people on the fixed incomes are, of course, always the ones who suffer first in inflation. Our program is aimed at bringing that down. And I have to say, not enough recognition has been paid to the fact that we have brought it down. We brought it down to single digit, where it is been for DATE-double digit.

You know, government gets a profit from inflation. If it is a sales tax, and the price of a commodity goes up, and the sales tax is based on percentage, the government's percentage goes up. In the income tax for ORG, that is been the big steal, where people getting cost-of-living pay raises have been moved up into upper-income tax brackets.

CARDINAL of the things where we believe government can participate and be of help-and we are trying desperately to do this-is to encourage foreign markets, export markets, because there is no question, the NORP farmer can and does produce more than the people in our own country can eat, so he has to have an export market. He is been caught worse than most people in the cost-price squeeze of inflation. The cost of the things he buys, even the finished products of the food that he himself grows, when he then buys that in the form of bread and so forth in the market, he finds that he is on the low end of the totem pole when he sells that raw product, but he is paying like everyone else is, the inflated price as it is gone through the industrial processes.

Yes, that and DATE as ENTITY there when I saw how extravagant and wasteful it was to have to run a program where ORG imposed every rule and restriction as to how you must use the money, establish the priorities. The priorities are not the same in community after community or State after State. They say, This problem GPE has decided is of this priority, and therefore most of the money must be spent here. But you can come to a community where that is not their major priority, but they do have another problem that they need to help on, but they do not have the flexibility to switch the funds. And this is what we are trying to do with the new federalism program. I could cite chapter and verse of horror stories about this and about these programs. My first veto of a ORG program, when I was ORG, was a program that on the surface sounded just fine. It was one of the poverty programs, and it was in a rural county of GPE, a project-they were going to put CARDINAL able-bodied welfare recipients to work in the county parks, maintaining and helping to keep them clean, the parks. That is exactly the type of thing that we want to do. My veto was because under their rules, CARDINAL the budget would have gone for CARDINAL administrators to handle the affairs of the CARDINAL people that were going to work in the park. And I thought that was a little unbalanced, and I vetoed it, and ORG had DATE to override the veto. They did not override it when I made public why I was vetoing it. I have copies of some minutes of ORG in a meeting that you participated in. CARDINAL of the sections here is in regards to welfare, and they are quoting you as saying that CARDINAL of the major reasons for keeping welfare at the NORP level is the likelihood that differing benefit levels among the States was based on a court ruling handed down while you were ENTITY of GPE. Do you recall that? And it said the courts had struck down the GPE residency requirements for welfare because it was a Federal program. The ENTITY implied that if ORG got out of the program, residency requirements might be acceptable to the courts. Is that a problem here in regards to your welfare change?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithskipwebertheiowadailypressassociationdesmoines", "title": "Interview With Skip Weber of the Iowa Daily Press Association in Des Moines", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-skip-weber-the-iowa-daily-press-association-des-moines", "publication_date": "09-02-1982", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It is true that the welfare standards vary, based on-and this is under the NORP domination of the program-so these people who say, Well, this ORG might cheat and not give as much as another State, are talking through their hats, because that is the present situation. But ORG insists on minimums that are based on percentages of what is a basic cost of living in the various areas. But because NORP money was involved, the States had residency requirements so that you had to legitimately be a citizen of that State in order to get welfare. When ORG-the court-on the basis of the ORG funds, struck that down, you found people just going shopping. And there was a great influx, not only into GPE, GPE-that was when its great problem developed. People only saw the end result of the amount of money that was being paid. They did not translate it into the added cost of living, of living in those places. Theoretically, you were not supposed to be better off in CARDINAL State or the other, that the lower amount was because of the lower cost of living in that area. But today, our idea is to find out if this is a part of what they want, to get the help of the ORG and local officials in fleshing out this concept that we have created in turning these programs back. So we are quoting here in regards to ORG-the suggestions made here. Under consideration is a voucher system for ORG. This-although here we are still in the early stages of trying to find a better method of providing the needed care for-ORG is the program for the older; ORG is the program that we have suggested ORG take over instead of giving back and to find a way of doing it that will maintain the funds that are needed for people with a true illness or injury and not the waste, the shocking waste that we have DATE.

Well, that is what the enterprise zones are all about, picking those hard-hit spots, both rural and urban, and generating employment through the use of tax incentives. And so far, a number of States have gotten tired of waiting for the ORG to act and do it at a national level, and have put in their own enterprise zone programs.

So, all I have are the DATE figures, except for GPE, and that is because they do break it down for the CARDINAL most populous GPE earlier than they do for the rest. GPE was CARDINAL at its peak-or, wait a minute-GPE was CARDINAL at its peak, and in DATE was down to CARDINAL. But to give you an idea of what the rest of the figures may look like when we get them-for the present, GPE is now down to CARDINAL. Ours was at CARDINAL in DATE and in DATE was back up to CARDINAL.

Back on the economic issue for TIME, back to the budgetary thing-when you campaigned for ORG, CARDINAL of your promises, of course, was to balance the budget by DATE. I wonder what you look at as the main reason for that. What happened to ORG that made it not work like you wanted it to? Nothing happened to ORG. And I am glad you asked this question.

And toward DATE, I announced that plan, and based our projections-that, yes, it could balance the budget by DATE, based on all the projections that those economists at that time-before the election. Between that announcement and DATE, that projection was no longer valid, because the economy in DATE was deteriorating so fast, and had not been projected to do so by any of these notable economists. So, it continued to worsen, and by the time of the DATE-then even a later time-was beyond any prediction; it had continued to get worse. Inflation, then, for DATE and DATE had been double digit DATE. Now, when I started-you have got to remember that the ENTITY comes in not with his own budget. You are still bound until DATE DATE by the budget of the previous administration. Nor was my program in effect. We were still trying to get it. And in DATE was when the further big dip came. Now, some economists have said, well, we had a DATE, DATE recession, and then the thing that happened in DATE was another-a different recession.

Defense spending, historically, DATE of PERSON, was virtually a CARDINAL of the budget. Under PERSON, it was PERCENT. So, the-and the increase in taxes-they doubled taxes in DATE before we got here.

When you have got the coastlines that we have got and the borders that we have, I do not think you will ever solve the problem totally by intercepting the drugs. The answer is going to be the kind that has PERSON down in GPE. To really be successful, you are going to have to take the customer away from the pusher.

It is not just a fellow on a corner with something in his pocket to sell. It is coming in in freighters. It is coming in in airplanes and everything else.

What we used was we used their radar facilities; also their air surveillance for information that we needed.

I'd like today to ask you-you, as ENTITY of GPE, as a citizen of GPE-are you satisfied with the situation concerning human rights in your own country? Individuals are going to have prejudice and so forth. But we have laws in our country that make it law-breaking to implement those prejudices and to try to do things unjustly to other people. You have to remember CARDINAL great difference about our country. A man put it to me in a letter once. And that is that you could leave here and go to GPE to live, but you could not become a NORP; or you could go to live in GPE or GPE or-name any country-you could not become CARDINAL of them; this is the only country in the world in which anyone from any corner of the world can come here and become an NORP, because that is our history. We came from every corner of the world. If you meet with a group of NORP-if we went around this room for the NORP present and asked them their background, their ancestry and so forth, you'd have quite a collection. As a matter of fact, my own background, going back to grandparents and great-grandparents, covers CARDINAL different countries-but here in this melting pot. So, the result is that the people that came here came not only with the desire for freedom, but they also brought with them many of the prejudices that existed because of national differences between various countries. People may have and do have-there are people who have a prejudice against someone of another faith, someone of another background or race. But if they do anything to hurt that person because of that prejudice, the law takes care of them. I think that in terms of human rights, lately, a lot has been said. Therefore, I'd like to ask you a question and return to your upcoming visit to GPE. ENTITY, I do not want to try and pry any secrets out of you, but could we find out what you are taking to GPE in your diplomatic briefcase, so to speak, and what you hope to bring back from there?

I was quite interested recently when the General Secretary, meeting with the leaders of your ORG, lessened some of the restrictions that government had imposed on the practice of that religion. Well, I have wondered if a further expansion of that-you see, our country came into being because people were being denied, in other countries, the right to worship God as they saw fit. And so, they left those countries and came to this new land as pioneers in order to worship. Well, I have just wondered if there is not a field there in your own country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice religion in the ways they chose. And here we call it separation of church and state. The government cannot deny people the right to worship, but by the same token, the churches cannot impose on government their beliefs. I think that really the question of human rights deserves lots of discussion. In that connection, I'd like to ask you, recently in GPE-I read about this in the GPE press-General PERSON was here in GPE. He is a dictator from GPE. When you meet with the NORP leaders-or met with them in GPE and GPE and GPE, you always touched on the question of human rights. Do you talk about that question with General PERSON, with the leaders of GPE, GPE, GPE? In your conversations, do you discuss with them the question of human rights? Oh, yes, there is no question but that we believe in our getting along with these other countries, that this is an issue, for CARDINAL reason, because of the background of all of our people. Government is influenced by public opinion. We are supposed-as you mentioned earlier, we are supposed to do in the ORG and here in this office basically what-meet the needs of the people, what the people want.

The majority of Presidents in this country, when they left office, write memoirs. Are you getting ready to write your memoirs when you leave office, and if so, when are we going to get a chance to read your memoirs? Well, I have been thinking very seriously about writing a book. In view of the fact that several people who have left government have written some books, I think maybe I better straighten out the record and tell things as they really are. People, not government, voluntarily provide money and funds and build what is called a Presidential library and museum, and this is happening with me. There is a group in the country; they have raised MONEY. In GPE will be built this structure. Now, in that building will be the CARDINAL of papers from this administration. They will be open; scholars can come and study them and research and so forth. And there will be also many things that will be of interest to the people-memorabilia that we have accumulated here.

I have a great admiration for the women of GPE, particularly in the NORP area.

Well, both sides, according to our proposal, are going to have to do away with some of their weapons. I think what you are referring to is a thing-on which we can be very flexible-and that is whether there is a sub-limit. I doubt very much that there will be much of a problem about the mix of weapons.

Under his proposal, a married couple that have a $MONEY income would find that their top bracket now is PERCENT. It would go to PERCENT under-or it will be PERCENT when the tax cut goes into effect. At $MONEY and something, the same married couple would find that they go from PERCENT up to PERCENT under his proposal. And this is not up to the $MONEY mark, and they are losing money. PERCENT of all of the tax relief in this coming tax cut on DATE will go to people below $MONEY. Now, when you stop to think that with our graduated income tax PERCENT of earners in this country pay PERCENT of the total amount of tax and the top CARDINAL, PERCENT of earners pay PERCENT of the total tax, I think it is only fair that a tax cut goes across the board, even PERSON, the same percentage cut for everyone. Your top budget people are warning that the money supply is growing too fast, and there is a fear, at least among some of them-PERSON and PERSON-that we could be headed for more inflation. Are you worried about that at this point? Not really, because I think that there is no question the market's been a little frightened by a surge there. And probably what makes them worried about that is DATE-before we got here, there was a giant surge, and that was the one that took us up to PERCENT interest rates and so forth. And then the string was pulled very firmly-1981-bringing it down. In fact, if that string had not been pulled for so long and so hard, we might not have had the depth of recession that we have had. But it is a kind of an uneven thing. It is not something that you can actually specify and say it is going to grow exactly at this amount-the money supply. The ORG has immediately moved on that, and I do not anticipate that. Sir, speaking of the ORG, will it be Mr. PERSON continuing, or might it be Mr. PERSON? Can you give us any clue?

Well, the ORG report also made it plain that just throwing money at it is not the answer. Right now, the highest tax finance program in GPE is public education-MONEY. And incidentally, it has increased over DATE, when everyone is so concerned about the decline in education, funding for education has increased by PERCENT.

You know, part of what is really tough for me as commander in chief is the fact that any kind of war is damaging. Any kind of war results in casualties.

But if the state think it is not OK, then let us throw those people in jail. I feel like it -- it -- you know, it leads to excessive incarceration, especially among minorities. And in places where it is been legalized, everything's doing OK. How do we move forward out of this legal gray area weirdness? Well, what you are seeing now is GPE, GPE, through state referendum. They are experimenting with legal marijuana. The position of my administration has been that we still have federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. But we are not going to spend a lot of resources trying to turn back decisions that have been made at the state level on this issue. My suspicion is that you are going to see other states start looking at this. What I am doing at the federal level is asking my ORG just to examine generally how we are treating nonviolent drug offenders. You know, what we have done is instead of focusing on treatment, the same way we focused, say, with tobacco or drunk driving or other problems where we treat it as a public health problem, we have treated this exclusively as a criminal problem. And I think that it is been counterproductive, and it is been, you know, devastating in a lot of minority communities. It presents the possibility at least of unequal application of the law. Now, the good news is, is that we are starting to get some interest among NORP, as well as NORP, in -- in reforming the criminal justice system. We have been able to initiate some changes administratively. And DATE, you had the first time in DATE where the crime rate and the incarceration rate went down at the same time. I hope we can continue with those trends because there is just a smarter way of dealing with these issues. PERSON, the next topic that we are going to cover is another angle on cybersecurity. We thought you'd be interested to know that searches on ORG for cybersecurity have really risen over DATE to the point where now more people are searching for cybersecurity than national security overall.

Cybersecurity is a huge issue we have been working on since I came to office. And in fairness, the administration before me probably was starting to work on it. Although the changes in the media have happened so fast and so much stuff is going online DATE that it becomes that much more important. The challenge we have got is that most of the Internet and the infrastructure that allows you to be posting on ORG and people accessing your stuff, most of that stuff's in private hands. It is not in public hands. And so what we have to do is to work with private companies telling them here is what we are seeing, here is how you can protect yourself, here is how you should share information with other companies who start seeing hackers getting into their stuff so that everybody can pool the information and we can all protect each other together. And it moves very fast because these hackers are -- you do not have to have a lot of equipment in order to be able to do this hacking. In fact, the hacking against ORG, which we believe was done by GPE, it was not even that sophisticated. So we continue to do more with private industry, to share with them best practices to how they can protect themselves. It is sort of like with your own ATM machine -- ATM card or your pass code, your passwords, your personal privacy. So we are sharing that information with them. But what we are also asking ORG to do is pass a law that would give us more tools to fight against this in the future. And I am confident that this is something we can actually get some good bipartisan support for. People are going to still be able to watch your show, I promise. I have CARDINAL family members who are in the law enforcement. And my husband who painted there, he is retired from ORG. Well, we are grateful for his service. You tell him thank you. I will do that.

Well, first of all, we always have to just remind ourselves that the overwhelming majority of police officers, they are doing a really tough job and they are doing it well. And they are doing it professionally. What we also know is that there is still biases in our society that in TIME situations where people having to make quick decisions that studies have shown NORP males are seen as more threatening, which puts them in more vulnerable positions. And so a lot of the way to solve this is to improve training so people can be aware of their biases ahead of time. And when I was in the state legislature back in GPE, for example, I passed a racial profiling bill. It essentially said how are we going to tackle this problem? Let us make sure we are keeping track of the race of everybody that was being stopped. And just by the small fix of keeping track, suddenly each cop when they were about to make a traffic stop they had to think, OK, am I stopping this person because I should be stopping them? Or is some bias at work? And just that kind of mindfulness about it ended up resulting in better data, better policing, more trust by the communities that are affected. And we can do some of that same stuff and use those same tools. I have put together a task force with police and community activists, including some of the young people who were actively involved in the Ferguson protest to make sure that we come up with what are the best training practices, what are the best tools, more body cameras on police officers so that they know they are being watched... And we are going to take some of those recommendations and we are going to put federal muscle behind them to see if we can make sure the communities all across the country are implementing them. Well, it'll be -- it is something that I think everybody, not just NORP or NORP, but everybody should be concerned about... because you get better policing when communities have confidence that the police are protecting and serving all people and not in any way showing bias.

I mean, the guy puts dic in dictatorship. So I am trying to understand how do you justify dealing with the PERSON? We have had the same policy since I was born, which was we were going to have an embargo. We were going to cut off all contact, all communication. And you know I have said this before. When you do something over and over again for DATE and it does not work, it is time to try something new. And we started off initially by allowing more travel to GPE by NORP to visit their family, sending more money back to their family members to help them back in GPE. We have been doing that for DATE. And it turns out it is been helpful to the people in GPE. They have more contact with their family. It gives them more hope. Now what we are saying is that by normalizing relations we are going to be able to still put pressure on the NORP government. But also what happens is now you have got more visitors to GPE. You start getting telecommunications into GPE. You start getting the Internet into GPE. And over time what you are going to see, gradually, is a shift. Because not everybody in GPE's able to escape to GPE, and the goal ultimately is to make sure that there is freedom in GPE, not just for the folks who have left. This is dependent on the ORG ruling, but do you think that same-sex marriage will be legalized in all of GPE during the time that you are in office? And what can you do to push that along? Well, we have done a lot, obviously, to push it along. I announced my belief that same-sex marriage should be legal that people should be treated the same. We argued against -- as an administration before ORG we argued against the Defense of Marriage Act that was treating married couples, same-sex couples differently in terms of federal benefits. ORG now is going to be taking on a case.

And under the law they should be treated equally. And as far as me personally, you know just to see all the loving gay and lesbian couples that I know who are great parents... You know the idea that we would not treat them like the brothers and sisters that they are, that does not make any sense to me. You are almost done with me, and your time as ENTITY. With the time left, what would you hope your legacy is? Well, we saved an economy that was on the brink of depression. We have created CARDINAL new jobs. We have doubled clean energy. We have reduced pollution. We have made sure that more young people can go to college. We have given now so far CARDINAL people health insurance that did not have it before. And that is going to grow over time. You know we have ended CARDINAL wars in a responsible way. But we still have challenges. Every day I wake up and I ask myself in particular how can I make sure that folks who are working hard can, not just survive, but how can they thrive? And so in the State of the Union that I just gave we talked about how can we provide more help for young families with childcare, huge burden on a lot of people? And what I want to do is make sure that DATE of community colleges are free so that young people can you know have confidence that if they go and try to get more skills that they are not going to be paying through the nose in terms of a lifetime of debt. You know I want to make sure that we are doing more to raise the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave. So there is a lot of basic stuff that we can do that would ensure the economy goes strong, but more importantly that everybody benefits from a strong economy.

And to tackle that question and many others we have a very popular ORG creator next, ENTITY. So I am very excited to hear your answers so I am just going to dive into the questions. So my first question for you is regarding education. A lot of my friends are the same age as me, as well as my online audience. And a lot of them are now going to college or are already in college. So my question for you is how can -- what do you think is the best long-term plan for making education as a whole more affordable for students? First of all, college remains the best investment you can make. If you want to do anything right now in this DATE economy, you are going to be measured by how much knowledge you have and how adaptable you are to changing circumstances. And college, it is not just that it gives you a particular skill, but it also teaches you how to learn you know for your whole life. And you know so it is the key to the future. CARDINAL of the things that we have done is to make sure that more young people have access to Pell Grants, more people have access to student loans that are lower interest rate. Now I have proposed to make community colleges free for DATE. And that is a good option for a lot of young people. There're DATE colleges, but a lot of times you can go to a community college for your first two years and then transfer your credits and go to a DATE college. But you have already gotten DATE free. And we know that it is already working in places like GPE. We want to take that all across the country. And then what we have done is we have also said once you get out, if you have got some debt then we want to be able to cap how much you pay back to PERCENT of your income. So that if you decide to become a teacher or a social worker or some helping profession that does not pay a lot, you do not feel like well I cannot do that job because my debt burden's going to be too high.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegrovedirectornewslabgoogle", "title": "Interview with Steve Grove Director of News Lab at Google", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-director-news-lab-google", "publication_date": "22-01-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

You got to know ahead of time how much does a school cost. If they tell you well, we will help you finance it, do not worry, you have got to understand you are going to be taking on some debt. And what is it going to look like once you are finished. You should have some sense of whether you can get in- state tuition versus going to a school out of state because there may be a big difference in terms of cost. And CARDINAL of the things we are also doing is seeing if we can get more high schools to work with their local colleges so that while you are in high school you can start getting some college credits. That may make it quicker for you to get your college degree. And you know the quicker you get your degree the cheaper it is going to be. My next question I actually relate to on a very personal level because when I was younger I was cyber bullied, which affected me in a very big way. So I went online and I basically spoke about my story, which then a lot of my viewers online came to me leaving comments and asking for tips and advice on you know how I dealt with it. And obviously you know I can give them tips based off of my experience. But sometimes I feel like I reach a point where I just cannot help them as much as I would truly love to. So my question for you is how can we prevent that, prevent bullying in schools and online? Because it is something that happens on a daily basis. Well, I have got to say this is CARDINAL area where I think your voice is more powerful than ENTITY of GPE you know because peers are going to have more influence than anybody. And when they see young people like you who are willing to speak out and say that is not right and protect other people from this kind of bullying, cyber bulling or any kind of bullying. That is what changes people's minds. That is what has an impact on them.

But the really most powerful testimonies came from students and young people like you who had organized themselves... and were going from campus to campus, school to school, going online and just explaining why you know that is -- you know that kind of bullying tactic is something we can guard against if everybody kind of speaks out against it and uses positive peer pressure to say that is just not acceptable. So you are already doing it. I think you have better advice than just about anybody about it because you experienced it. You felt it. So DATE ORG kidnapped CARDINAL of schoolgirls. And a lot of them are still missing. So what do you think we can do to raise awareness about this issue, and also just prevent it from happening again? Well, as people may know or may not know, ORG is a radical, violent, terrible extremist organization in GPE. And they kidnapped CARDINAL young women. And are -- they are in many cases still being held. What we tried to do is to help the NORP government to deal with the problem. The NORP government has not been as effective as it needs to be in not only finding the girls, but also in stopping this extremist organization from operating inside their territory. And what we are trying to do is mobilize other countries to try to give the NORP government more resources, not just military equipment but better intelligence, allowing them to track where these folks are, and to try to stop them. But I tell you, the more young people are engaged in issues like this and speak out and let their elected officials know that they care about it, the more attention that is paid to it. And ultimately that is how you solve these problems. There are a lot of countries that are still struggling. You know during your lifetime more people have come out of poverty and more people have been able to feel more secure around the world than probably any time in human history.

So how can we make them a part of that? Well, you know GPE and GPE and some other countries around the world that do not have a democratic government and do not have the same traditions of free speech and open Internet, they have recognized. I think that the Internet's so powerful that if people start being able to communicate then they maybe start criticizing the government. And then they may be able to mobilize opposition. And things that are unfair or people who are being mistreated suddenly have a voice. So they are trying to keep a lid on things. And we consistently, wherever we go, insist that issues like free speech and a free and open Internet, we think that that is part of who we are as a people. We think that that has value not just in GPE but everywhere. We obviously cannot make laws in GPE. But what we can do is let them know and shine a spotlight on some of those practices and indicate to them that any government that is afraid of its own people and people just peacefully trying t speak out and voice their own opinions is over the long term not going to be as effective and as long-lasting as a government that trusts its people to be able to communicate freely. So I am going to be honest with you. Before I came here to do this interview for ORG I never really followed politics that much. A lot of my online audience and just the younger generation do not seem as interested in it. So my question for you is why should the younger generation be interested in politics? And why should it matter to them? Well, basically politics is just how do we organize ourselves as a society? You know how do we make decisions about how we are going to live together? Well, the truth of the matter is that the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said you know what? We should start colleges. And dating back to PERSON, who started something called the land grant colleges. And he understood that government should invest in people being able to get an education and having the tools to succeed.

Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well. When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I am not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, NORP and NORP, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our CARDINAL countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we will also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life. We have made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the NORP side about SALT and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the NORP are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides. We shape our own policies to accommodate a constantly changing world, and we hope the NORP will do the same. Together we can give this change a positive direction.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentscharlestonsouthcarolinaremarksthe31stannualmeetingthesouthernlegislative", "title": "Charleston, South Carolina Remarks at the 31st Annual Meeting of the Southern Legislative Conference.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/charleston-south-carolina-remarks-the-31st-annual-meeting-the-southern-legislative", "publication_date": "21-07-1977", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

CARDINAL mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent. Other than that, it was very good.

First, let me say our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are necessary to protect GPE's farmers from excessive losses during this drought. Already we have taken a number of actions. We have formed an interagency drought policy committee to coordinate ORG action. ORG is working hard to keep traffic moving on the Mississippi River and elsewhere in spite of some of the lowest water levels in history. And in order to help livestock owners, Secretary PERSON has permitted grazing on set-aside lands. And now is the time to start work on legislation to help the many crop farmers who will suffer substantial losses. At my direction, Secretary PERSON has been working closely with the leadership of the ORG and ORG ORG in an effort to draft timely legislation. We have sought to make this a bipartisan effort, and so far I am pleased by the cooperation that we have received. Permit me to outline the CARDINAL points we are seeking in this drought legislation. First, relief should go to those who need it most. Second, many of our farmers purchased Federal crop insurance, a sound business decision. They should not be penalized relative to farmers who-did not act with such prudence. Third, this legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable things. No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops. Fourth, drought relief spending has to be considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the ORG deficit; and according to the DATE bipartisan budget agreement that we reached with ORG, to put it very simply, we mustn't bust the budget. The automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending triggers would take back from farmers with CARDINAL hand what we are providing in drought relief with the other.

The solution to the world agricultural problem is to get government out of the way and let farmers compete. It is true, of course, that getting rid of all export subsidies, import barriers, and the like-all the things that make it harder for our farmers to compete in world markets-is a very tall order; but we are not backing down.

It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice.

Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently.

And that is why I have been so pleased to hear about what some of you are doing already both in working with us and on your own. Here at the ORG, you have developed ORG to give restaurants a strong foundation for making healthy changes. You have launched a website, Healthydiningfinder.com, to help consumers identify healthy menu options in their area. You are keeping your members up to date with the latest information and statistics about efforts to address childhood obesity. And you are working with other groups in the industry to meet the goal of doubling the amount of produce used in the food industry over DATE. And across the country, individual restaurants and chains are also focusing on our children's health -- not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it also makes sense for their bottom line. Right now, many restaurants are making a point to offer fresh produce and healthy choices aimed at kids and adults. Others are serving more low-fat dishes, whole grain breads, fruit on the side. Some are even offering kid-size portions of the meals they serve on the main menu. And chefs across the country are partnering with local schools to help them make healthy choices. Together we have to do more. And we need your help to lead this effort. Now, what I do know is that in the restaurant industry creativity is your lifeblood. It is what sets you apart from the competition, and it keeps customers coming back for more. And today I am asking you to use that creativity to rethink the food you offer, especially dishes aimed at young people, and to help us make the healthier choice the easier choice. First, it is important to reduce the number of empty calories that our families are consuming, calories that have no nutritional benefit whatsoever. And believe me, I know this is easier said than done. After all, we as humans, we are programmed to crave sugary, fatty, salty foods. And as people who work to meet those needs, I know it is tempting to respond by creating products that are sweeter, richer and saltier than ever before. See, feeding those cravings does just respond to people's natural desires, it actually helps shape them.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 5159, "text": "The more of these foods people eat, the more they are accustomed to that taste, and after a while, those unhealthy foods become a permanent part of their eating habits. It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And DATE, no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is NORP, NORP, NORP, NORP -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. CARDINAL local survey found that PERCENT of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; PERCENT includes chicken fingers; CARDINAL includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over 1,000 calories, and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for DATE. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just CARDINAL token healthy option on the menu, or taking out CARDINAL problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime. This philosophy also needs to apply to the rest of the food that you offer, because just as we eat out as a family, we also should be able to eat well as a family.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}

I am not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love. That could mean substituting wheat pasta for white pasta in your regular recipes, or taking out an existing -- taking an existing dish and cutting the amount of butter or cream -- not enough to sacrifice flavor -- we all like flavor -- but just enough to make a meaningful difference in the amount of calories and fat. It could mean serving PERCENT or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request -- which would hurt me deeply. And no matter what you do, it is also important, truly important, to keep portion sizes in check, because we all know that the size of a meal is just as important as the ingredients it is made of. But your role in helping address childhood obesity is not limited to what you put on your menus and how you label them for parents. It is also about how you market those products to our kids. Our kids do not learn about the latest fast-food creations on their own. They hear about them on TV, advertisements, in the Internet, video games, and many other places. As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids. A study DATE found that only a small percentage of advertising aimed at kids promoted healthy foods, while most promoted foods with a low nutritional value. It is not enough just to limit ads for foods that are not healthy. It is also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy. And if there is anyone who can sell healthy food to our kids, it is all of you, because you know what gets their attention. You know what makes a lasting impression.

Again, I know many of you have said that you would offer and promote healthy options in a heartbeat if they were as popular as the healthy -- unhealthy options, because that is how business works, and I understand that. But I have yet to meet a single parent who does not understand the threat of childhood obesity. I have yet to meet a single parent who is not eager to buy healthier products. They just need more information. They need easier access to those products. And I have heard from more companies over DATE that the market is starting to move in a healthier direction. Folks are beginning to ask for more fruits and vegetables and for smaller portions. So when it comes right down to it, this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again. That is why we are committed to helping increase that demand and making it easier for you to do what is right. And we have started by requiring chain restaurants to provide calorie counts on their menus and menu boards. And I am grateful for the support we have received from the ORG to get this done. And I want to encourage restaurants that are not providing calorie counts to join us in this effort. And because so many of the calories our kids consume come from school, we are also working to get more nutritious food into our lunchrooms and our vending machines.

As part of Let us Move, we are setting a goal of doubling the number of schools that participate in the Healthier US Schools Challenge by DATE.

And that is the difference between what we and NORP in ORG are offering the NORP people right now. Let me give you a few specific examples of our different approaches. DATE, I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. CARDINAL of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in GPE. But for DATE, our tax code has actually given MONEY in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in GPE, right here in GPE. And I am proposing that all NORP businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in DATE. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like GPE and GPE and GPE. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. For DATE, NORP have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. PERSON was here in GPE he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like GPE keep CARDINAL of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. PERSON dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps GPE strong. And, GPE, I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in GPE -- not that create jobs overseas. That is CARDINAL difference between the NORP vision and the NORP vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example.

Though I should say it did not stop a lot of them from showing up at the ribbon-cuttings ---- trying to take credit. And engineers, economists, governors, mayors of every political stripe believe that if we want to compete in this global economy, we need to rebuild this vital infrastructure.

You deserve some help. And because folks in the middle class are more likely to spend their tax cut on basic necessities, that strengthens the economy as a whole.

And these are the folks who are less likely to spend the money -- which is why economists do not think tax breaks for the wealthy would do much to boost the economy. We should not hold middle-class tax cuts hostage any longer. We are ready, DATE, if they want, to give tax cuts to every NORP making $MONEY or less. That is PERCENT of NORP. Now, for any income over this amount, the tax rates would just go back to what they were under President PERSON. This is not to punish folks who are better off -- PERSON bless them.

And for those who claim that our approach would somehow be bad for growth and bad for small businesses, let me remind you that with those tax rates in place, under President PERSON, this country created CARDINAL jobs and raised incomes and had the largest surplus in our history. In fact, if the NORP leadership in ORG really wants to help small businesses, they will stop using legislative maneuvers to block an up or down vote on a small business jobs bill that is before the ORG right now. This is a bill that would do CARDINAL things. It would cut taxes for small businesses and make loans more available for small businesses. It is fully paid for, will not add to the deficit.

In return for increased Title I funding and in return for an increase in the ORG budget of elementary and secondary schools act money, we expect results. You see, we are not going to just spend money and hope something positive happens. We are going to spend money and see results. Well, if you believe in high standards and accountability, then it is really important to get the young kids up to the starting line at the same time. And that is why the Head Start reforms we are going to talk about are important, the reforms which PERSON and his committee are carrying to the floor of the ORG relatively soon. I want to thank PERSON, who is the ORG superintendent of schools in GPE. I appreciate PERSON as the superintendent of schools, an even tougher job.

I want to thank PERSON and PERSON, the CARDINAL fine teachers we had to meet. For the teachers who are here, thank you for doing what you are doing. You are a part of a noble profession, an incredibly important profession for the future of this country. You know what I know, that reading is the key to all learning. And the research-I see some of my friends from ORG, ORG who are here. He understands how the brain works, and he is spent a lot of time analyzing what works and what does not work. He caught my attention when I was the Governor of GPE. I would ask him a question, Are you sure we can teach kids, you know, the so-called impossible-to-teach? He said, Sure, I know it. And so he started doing research to convince the people about the real future. And he says that-he and his fellow researchers-that preschoolers can learn much more than we ever thought possible about words and sounds. In other words, society limited how much a certain-how much a preschooler could learn. It kind of felt like certain things were impossible to-certain knowledge was impossible to impart to our children, particularly the young. And so I want to thank PERSON and the good folks who are focusing on science, who have opened up a tremendous realm of possibility now to achieve that which we want, a literate GPE. Even the youngest child can learn that we read words and letters from left to right or that letters are associated with sounds; even the youngest of toddlers can figure that out over time. In CARDINAL exercise, children clapped for each syllable in a word. They can trace letters on the page to begin to understand the movements we use to write. They can play word games and learn rhymes and songs that help them to develop their own vocabulary. That sounds like a simple curriculum, but it is research-based, all aimed at laying the foundation for children to become good readers. These are what we call the building blocks, and these building blocks need to be a part of ORG programs all across GPE. Research also shows that if children do not develop these skills before they reach kindergarten, they will struggle to achieve success in their lives.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

If the scientists come together and say, If we fail in our mission to give children the foundation necessary for reading, they will fall behind and may not be able to develop the skills necessary, so they have to struggle in life, we got a-this is an opportunity that we better not miss. We cannot let our children down. Now look, ORG is a great opportunity to provide the foundation for reading. And first, I just want everybody to understand, ORG does a good job of giving children nutrition and medical care. That has been primarily the focus, and the program needs to be applauded for meeting that goal. And nobody in this room wants ORG to change that focus. We just want an additional focus to ORG, and the ORG focus is teaching the basics for reading and math. That is the new focus, along with health and nutrition. Even though most children in ORG make some educational progress, most of them still leave the program with skills and knowledge levels that are far below what we expect. Now, in my line of work, if you see a problem, you address it. And I see that as a problem. If we are not meeting expectations, if we are not challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, let us start right now in GPE. We want ORG to set higher ambitions for the CARDINAL children it serves. And so I laid out a plan. Every ORG center must prepare children to succeed by teaching the basics of learning and literacy. That is the cornerstone of the plan. And every ORG teacher must have the skills necessary to do so. And so we started DATE when we launched ORG, ORG, to train CARDINAL ORG teachers and supervisors in the C.I.R.C.L.E. program, which is used right here at this school. In other words, it is a go-by. It is not a difficult chore for a teacher to take the basic learning from the C.I.R.C.L.E. program developed by the scientists and implement it at the ORG program in which he or she teaches. PERSON, the assistant ORG supervisor at GPE, was one of the teachers in the program. PERSON and CARDINAL of other trained teachers went back to train other teachers at the program.

Now, in order to make sure that the C.I.R.C.L.E. program is-and other curriculums which work-are being used, is working, I believe there needs to be an evaluation program. And after all, if we are spending a lot of taxpayers' money, which we are, it makes sense to determine whether or not these programs are, in fact, laying the foundation for reading. Now, I fully understand a DATE child is not going to take a standardized test. That we would-we would be defeating the purpose of accountability before we even began if we said, Okay, we will give standardized tests to DATE. But we can have children assessed by asking simple questions. You know, words go left to right. Are you able to identify certain sounds? Are they developed by-developing the key skills necessary? And I think what needs to happen is- and I hope ORG agrees-that the simple evaluations at DATE and DATE will tell us whether or not progress is being made in developing a curriculum necessary to teach children how to read. And if they are, we ought to be praising the programs, and if they are not, something else ought to happen. We cannot miss the opportunity much longer in GPE. And so PERSON is here because his committee and the ORG is considering legislation that would put a new emphasis on language skills and literacy skills in ORG programs. In other words, we are going to codify into law that which we have started through the teacher training program. The legislation will require ORG providers to teach language, reading, and writing skills, as well as early math skills. In other words, it now becomes a part- when they pass the law that says the ORG mission is further defined as an educational mission. And those programs that are used must be proven by scientific research. We are going to have high standards. We are going to trust the local people to develop the curriculum, but in return for ORG money, we want you to measure to tell us whether or not children are learning to read and write.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

And therefore, we are asking people to develop an accountability system without everybody being at the same starting position. And that is why it is so important for preschool programs to be focused on literacy, so that when the accountability systems kick in in GPE or GPE or anybody else, we can truthfully say that every child has been given the tools necessary to be at the starting line at the same time, so that we have true accountability, true measurement. Now, there is Governors around the State, the country that have said, Look, give us the flexibility to be able to dovetail the ORG program into our preschool programs so that all students-so we have a better control over whether or not the students are given the skills necessary so that when you hold us to account, we can achieve that which we want to achieve, which is excellence in the classroom. I appreciate the desire for flexibility. I support the Governors' desire for flexibility so long as, CARDINAL, NORP monies going to the States are used only for ORG. In other words, what we really do not want to do is say we are going to focus on ORG; the ORG money goes for, you know, a prison complex. I know that will not happen with Governor PERSON, but there needs to be a guarantee that the NORP money spent on ORG only go to ORG. Secondly, States and local governments must put money into the program, which would lock in the ORG money for ORG. So, in other words, the flexibility given to the ORG would not allow the GPE budget flexibility. It is management flexibility to be able to take the Head Start program, dovetail into the preschool program, then the kindergarten program, and then into the elementary school program. Governors ought to have that flexibility to-hope that ORG will provide that flexibility so that when the accountability systems kick in, fully kick in, that a Governor can truthfully say, Well, I have had the tools necessary to make sure the Head Start program fits into an overall comprehensive plan for literacy and math for every child in GPE, in Governor PERSON's case.

I would like to say at the beginning that this is a very wise decision that the ORG has made. And I would like to emphasize that the registration act-which has now been passed and will go into effect-is not to threaten war, but is to preserve peace. The action taken by our country and almost all other nations in the democratic world is designed to preserve peace. We are deeply concerned about the unwarranted and vicious invasion of GPE by GPE and occupation by them of this innocent and defenseless country, which is completely unwarranted. We have taken a series of steps-economic, diplomatic, political, military steps-in order to convince GPE that their action is ill advised and, of course, encouraging them to withdraw their troops from GPE and also to prevent further aggression if they should be tempted to do so. All of the action we have taken is peaceful in nature, and we will stay committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes. The freedom-fighters in GPE, who are striving for the liberation of their country, deserve the admiration of the entire world, and their courage and persistence in fighting for freedom is the greatest single deterrent to the NORP aggression being successful. I would like to emphasize that the registration act is not a draft; I am not in favor of a peacetime draft. This registration act will do a great deal to marshal our own Nation's resistance to succumbing to temptation which might lead to war, and therefore lead to a mandatory draft. The only time that I envision a mandatory draft law being advocated to the ORG would be in time of war or in time of national emergency, and in a case of that kind, when our Nation's security is threatened, separate legal action would be required by ORG, a separate law, to initiate a draft under those circumstances.

Oh, by the way, and in the meantime, we prevented the worst financial crisis from getting even worse, turned the economy from contraction to expansion, made the largest investment in clean energy in history, the largest investment in education in DATE, expanded the Pell grant program, dealt with a H1N1 virus on the side. That is what your support has helped us do at home. Abroad, we have begun a new era of engagement. We are working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking a world free of them. We are working with other nations to confront climate change. We are now a leader and not a follower in that critical mission. We banned torture. We are rebuilding our military. We are reaffirming our alliances. We have begun to leave GPE to its own people, as I committed to doing in the campaign. And we have charted a new way forward in GPE and GPE. We are making progress DATE in taking the fight to ORG and across the globe. And I went to GPE on behalf of the NORP people to begin a new dialogue with the NORP world. We are living up to our obligations as a wealthy nation, helping to promote food security around the world, helping to deal with diseases around the world. We are living up to a moment that demands NORP leadership by standing with the people of GPE as we speak. So in ways large and small, we have begun to deliver on the change that we talked about, the change that you believed in and that you campaigned hard for. We have got a lot more work to do.

That is the reason you supported me.

GPE, for example, has posted strong economic growth, developed some of the world's fastest growing telecommunications companies, and made major investments that will boost tourism and trade.

These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by ORG but by patients and doctors. To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. And that is what the NORP people must understand and Members of ORG and ORG must understand. Many of the costs that we are talking about do not start in an examining room or an operating room; they start in a courtroom.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 5445, "text": "What is happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in DATE. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying MONEY to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system DATE. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients. When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern GPE and the people of GPE must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine.

Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose TIME in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. GPE's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains MONEY from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand.

I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, CARDINAL, I understand the problem and I intend to work with ORG to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of GPE, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. CARDINAL is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the ORG that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from CARDINAL area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from CARDINAL area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your ORG budget spends MONEY a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for ORG and ORG and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to ORG with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, PERCENT of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life.

Interestingly enough, GPE has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in DATE. Patients in that GPE see their claims settled CARDINAL faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since DATE, insurance premiums for GPE doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most GPE. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the ORG ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, ORG needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. CARDINAL docs leave CARDINAL counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on DATE about medical liability. The ORG passed a good medical liability reform bill DATE. I want to thank the CARDINAL Members of ORG for working on it.

I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the ORG to get the bill moving. It is important for the GPE Senators from this GPE and other GPE to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in DATE.

This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for NORP manufacturers and entrepreneurs.

For DATE now, ORG has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. DATE at ORG, I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for DATE.

I think the major obstacle to peace is going to be the politics of both NORP and NORP trying to take advantage of the difficult work that these CARDINAL leaders are going to have to do to define a state; that is what I think. I think that extremists, in some instances, will try to stop the peace. I believe there is a lot of forces at play in GPE that will try to stop these CARDINAL men from defining what a state will look like. And my job is to help them stay on the big picture and have the confidence necessary to make tough decisions. But there is a mechanism to deal with that, and that is ORG, for the best word-is the trilateral commission, which we head, to deal with these roadmap issues. Now, we can solve those-we can work through those problems, but the key is to define a state. And the reason I believe it is because these CARDINAL men, with whom I have spent a fair amount of time, are committed. The state will come into being subject to a roadmap. But the first step is to define what is possible; here is what a state will look like. And that is very important for both the NORP and the NORP. Well, the key is for me to convince the CARDINAL leaders to work through the hard issues. I will help them, but in order for there to be lasting peace, they have got to come to the table; they have got to negotiate it. And what ends up happening in this process is that the leaders will commit, and then they will get their committees to work, and it gets stuck. And that is when I will have to work with PERSON to unstick it, just to keep it moving. CARDINAL thing is, is that they know that they have got a good partner in peace in me. They also know that I am not going to be in office DATE, so there is a certain urgency to get this state defined. And my trip is going to be to just kind of keep momentum.

They are going to have to have institutions that bring confidence for the NORP. They have to have the ability to attract investment. The NORP are great entrepreneurs, and if just given a chance, I am confident the business community will flourish.

I also believe that the NORP people are not bad-they are good people-and that they can have a better way forward. Well, what are you going to do about it? It is CARDINAL thing to define the problem, do you have a strategy? And if you say you can solve it diplomatically, what is your strategy? And I will explain the strategy of economic isolation, that-you know, it is sad; we really do not need to have to be in this position. If ORG would suspend their enrichment programs, like the international community has demanded, there is a better way forward for them. But they say that they need this program. And my answer is, is that if you need it, then why have not you been transparent and disclosed it and honest about it? And what were you doing with a military-secret military program in the first place? And so I view GPE as a danger; I truly do. And I do not view the people as a danger, I view the Government as a danger. But will it be harder for you to try to convince GPE what-the NORP position after the intelligence report? The fact that I am having to explain it means it is harder after the report. But I believe I will be able to convince them. What they want to know is whether or not I think they are a danger. They want to know whether I think it is a danger and are we committed to helping people achieve security.

Secretary PERSON told ORG in an interview recently that the diplomatic option is still PERCENT in focus. Does that mean that you are going to still pressure GPE on the diplomatic front? We will continue to pressure them on the diplomatic front. And it is hard, because sometimes people are more interested in market share for their goods than they are for achieving peace. And so I have spent a lot of time with allies in Europe, for example, convincing them of the importance of working together to send a common message to the NORP regime. So yes, the diplomatic option is on the table, and it is active, and we are working hard. On the GPE issue-I do not know if I am allowed to ask one-- All you got to do is ask; I will handle it.

That is the President that the people want there in GPE, and he ought to go forward. And that is going to be on my agenda when I talk to friends and allies in the Middle East, that-and we can collectively send the message to President PERSON. We have sanctioned GPE, and I am looking at different ways to keep sending a tough message because, so far, he has shown no willingness to be constructive on GPE or in dealing with a militant ORG or in stopping suiciders from heading into Iraq- in other words, some reasonable things that we would like to see done in order to improve relations which he has not done.

We have had plenty of high-ranking officials go to support Prime Minister PERSON. I think about PERSON, and I think about Admiral PERSON, who I sent over there to help analyze what the NORP forces need. Listen, I was very impressed when Prime Minister PERSON made the decision to move NORP forces into the extremist stronghold and dealt with them. That is what you are supposed to do. And in order to have a safe and secure society, the state has got to show that it can provide security for the people and not tolerate pockets of extreme radicals who are murderous in their intentions, and he did. And right after that, I sent Admiral PERSON in to say, look, we need to help strengthen this man. He showed courage and leadership, and he needs to have a military that is able to function at the behest of a state to provide security.

I take it you are not calling it illegal. What I am saying is that companies thrive in GPE in part because they benefit from the best university system in the world, the best infrastructure -- although I'd like to see us do a little better on infrastructure. You know, there are a whole range of benefits that have helped to build companies, create value, create profits. For you to continue to benefit from that entire architecture that helps you thrive, but move your technical address simply to avoid paying taxes, is neither fair nor is it something that is going to be good for the country over the long term. And this is basically taking advantage of tax provisions that are technically legal , but I think most people would say if you are doing business here, if you are basically still an NORP company, but you are simply changing your mailing address in order to avoid paying taxes, then you are really not doing right by the country and by the NORP people. Some people would respond that, you know what, these guys are hired to maximize profit. And they are doing basically what they were hired to do. And in fact, it is plenty NORP for them to try to make as much profit as they can, hire as many people as they can as a result. Well, keep in mind that what we are trying to do is to say that if you simply acquire a small company in GPE or some other country to take advantage of the low tax rate, you start saying we are now magically an NORP company, despite the fact that you may only have CARDINAL employees there And you have got CARDINAL employees in GPE. You are just gaming the system. You continue to benefit in all kinds a ways from being an NORP company. It is true that, you know, there are a lot of things that may be legal that probably are not the right thing to do by the country. People are paid to maximize profits. They are also paid to make sure that they are thinking about, in addition to shareholder value, how do you grow a company over the long term?

Your critics suggest that you have not put the presidential muscle behind this issue, certainly the way you did health care or the way you did stimulus early on in your presidency. Well, we reached out repeatedly to both NORP and NORP. If we lower corporate tax rates and close loopholes, there is going to be more certainty in terms of what corporations pay. They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance. It would allow us potentially to have companies who have profits overseas to start bringing some of those profits back and reinvesting in GPE. So there is a whole bunch of good reasons why we should do it. I will be honest with you ENTITY. And they have trouble getting stuff done right now even when they say they want to do something.

Well, let us move from talking about the guys in the C suites to average NORP here. What will you tell average NORP viewer about the outlook for the economy?

You have got people who recognize that what goes up can come down as well. I will leave it up to them to make determinations about whether valuations and stock prices are too high.

And if we close some of those loopholes, not just carried interest but a range that we know are not economically productive, then sure, some folks do not get to take advantage of stuff they should've been taking advantage of anyway. But that also means we can finance government, keep our deficits under control, and invest in the things that we need to grow over the long term. There is no doubt that the economies of GPE and Europe have intertwined, primarily around the energy sector.

The good news is that, despite some of those commercial concerns, we have seen Europe move with us - not always as fast as we'd like, but they get there. And sadly, tragically, the shooting down of this ORG airliner and the recognition that it is likely it was shot down and it is also likely that it was conducted by non-state actors that were provided incredibly powerful weapons by the NORP government - all that, I think, may stiffen the spine of my NORP partners moving forward. I want to ask you about GPE. What do you make of these - the ORG banning these flights and then lifting it? Do you think it is safe for NORP to fly to GPE? You know, we have not made decisions when it comes to airline safety based on not just politics, but even our strong alliance with GPE. We have to just look at the facts.

It makes sure that we actually start bending the cost curve, controlling the rising premiums by instituting better practices in terms of how we reimburse doctors and how we ask hospitals to work together. We have already invested in electronic IT, electronic medical records, things that can help make the system more efficient. So we have this enormous opportunity.

And we employ a couple of people around us. What is being done to free up funding and encourage the growth of all the small businesses that have such a tremendous impact on our economy? how exactly are you planning on helping small businesses grow and prosper, besides simply providing tax breaks? Well, let me start with some specific issues that confront every small business all across the country. And it is absolutely true that if we can get small businesses back on their feet, then that is going to go a long way towards bringing the unemployment rate down, because that is the fastest generator of jobs across the country. Number CARDINAL, small businesses really are still struggling with financing. You hear stories everywhere you go that even profitable, successful businesses are having trouble getting financing, because banks frankly just do not want to take the risk. After having taken way too many risk before, now they are taking no risk. And small businesses are punished for that. So we have expanded the ORG loan, the ORG loan, portfolio by PERCENT. We have been waiving guarantees and fees, trying to streamline the process, just to get more capital into the hands of small businesses. It is important to see if we can give more incentives to small business. So, for example, we are just eliminating capital gains for small businesses, which is particularly important if you have got a start-up. DATE, you may end up being successful with your small business, but suddenly you have got to pay taxes on it. If you can take that money and, instead of paying PERSON, reinvest it in your business, you can grow it further. So we think that that is the kind of strategy that makes a lot of sense. We want to also make sure that we are providing tax credits for hiring of small businesses -- small businesses that are hiring new employees. And so we have got a whole range of proposals there. Now, in addition to the tax credits, in addition to the financing, CARDINAL of the other things that, frankly, small businesses need is just a economic environment that is growing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

That PERCENT swing offers greater opportunities for small businesses to prosper and thrive. CARDINAL of the biggest burdens on small businesses is health-care costs. And probably nobody benefits more from our health-care proposals than small businesses, because what we are doing is we are saying that not only will you get tax credits to buy health insurance, but we are also going to let you pool, buy in to a big exchange so that you have the same purchasing power as a big company like -- ORG or, you know, ORG is able to negotiate with insurance companies and get a good deal. Well, now small businesses, by pooling together in this exchange, are going to have that same leverage. That will help lower their costs. And for a lot of small businesses, it is not just a matter of giving health insurance to your employees; it is also just being able to buy health insurance for yourself. That will cut down on small businesses' costs and they will be able to, again, invest more in their business.

We set up a program for loan modification that so far CARDINAL people have taken advantage of across the country.

I get letters all the time of people who've gone through all kinds of hoops, filled out forms; the bank does not call them back, or after they have gone through a trial period, the bank says, Well, you know, we now think we should not give you a home modification. What we are trying to do is to increase transparency and force all the banks to tell us exactly what are you doing with your customers who want to stay in their homes, can afford to pay a mortgage but need something a little bit more limited.

So it is important in any health-care program to make sure that the young and the healthy and the older and -- and the sicker are in a single pool.

That would provide a huge amount of relief for people. We still need to expand more the Pell grant program, make it both accessible to more people and raise the amount of tuition. In order to pay for this -- the best part of this is we can actually figure out how to pay for it, because right now you have got a lot of banks and financial-service companies who are still middlemen in the federally guaranteed loan programs.

And so thinking about how to resettle these populations in places that are viable economically, that have the resources to support populations, is a long-term development challenge that the international community is going to have to support. We continue to put pressure on the NORP government. If they are not cooperative in these efforts, then it is going to be appropriate for us to conclude that engagement does not work. And you know, we are going to have to apply additional pressure on GPE in order to -- in order to achieve our objectives. But my hope is, is that we can broker agreements with all the parties involved to deal with what has been an enormous human tragedy in that region. Another question we missed from the deck, but it was about FAC. And essentially, a user's saying, why is it taking so long to close down FAC? Number CARDINAL, you have got a whole bunch of individuals in FAC, some of whom are very dangerous, some of whom were low- level fighters, some of whom the courts have determined should never have been put there in the first place. We have had to evaluate each of those cases -- CARDINAL of cases -- one by one to determine what these various categories are, and do it in a way that stands up to our standards of due process and legal scrutiny. Then we have got to figure out, if we are closing FAC, where are we going to put them?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

CARDINAL of the things that we have had to try to communicate to the country at large is that historically we have tried a lot of terrorists in our courts. We have them in our federal prisons. But it is been one of those things that is been subject to a lot of, in some cases, you know, pretty rank politics. And you know, we have got to work through that process because ORG ultimately controls the purse strings in creating new facilities. If ORG makes a decision that they are going to try to block the opening of a new facility, it potentially constrains what our administration can do. And so this is something that we have got to work through both in ORG but also with public opinion, so that people understand that ultimately this is the right thing to do; by closing FAC, we can regain the moral high ground in the battle against these terrorist organizations. There is been no bigger propaganda weapon for many of these extremists than pointing to FAC and saying that we do not live up to our own ideals. And that is something that I strongly believe we have to resist, even if it has some costs to it and even if it is not always the most politically popular thing to do. ENTITY, we do not have much time left, but I want to make sure we get to the issue of energy, the environment. CARDINAL of the rare moments where you were able to get applause from your friends on the NORP side of the aisle in ORG TIME was when you mentioned nuclear energy. And DATE your budget announced tripling the loan guarantees for nuclear reactors. A lot of people had questions about just how this will work and why you did that.

{"id": 2955, "text": "Well, you are not going to get any argument from me about the need to create clean-energy jobs. I think this is going to be the driver of our economy over the long term. And that is why we put in record amounts of money for solar and wind and biodiesel and all the other alternative, clean-energy sources that are out there. In the meantime, though, unfortunately, no matter how fast we ramp up those energy sources, we are still going to have enormous energy needs that will be unmet by alternative energy. And the question then is, where -- where will that come from? Nuclear energy has the advantage of not emitting greenhouse gases. For those who are concerned about climate change, we have to recognize that countries like GPE and GPE and others have been much more aggressive in their nuclear industry, and much more successful in having that a larger part of their portfolio, without incident, without accidents. We are mindful of the concerns about storage of spent fuel and concerns about security. But we still think it is the right thing to do, if we are serious about dealing with climate change. With respect to clean-coal technology, it is not possible at this point to completely eliminate coal from the menu of our energy options. And if we are ever going to deal with climate change in a serious way, where we know GPE and GPE are going to be greatly reliant on coal, we have got to start developing clean-coal technologies that can sequester the harmful emissions; because otherwise, countries like GPE and GPE are not going to stop using coal, we will still have those same problems, but we will not have the technology to make sure that it does not harm the environment over the long term. So I know that there is some skepticism about whether there is such a thing as clean-coal technology. What is true is right now, that we do not have all the technology to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from a coal -- coal-powered -- power plants. But the technology is close, and it makes sense for us to make that investment now, not only because it'll be good for GPE, but it will also ultimately be good internationally. We can license and export that technology in ways that help other countries use a better form of energy that is going to be helpful to the climate-change issue.

It makes sure that we are putting teachers back in the classroom. It makes certain that we are providing incentives to hire veterans who have been out of work, but also the long-term unemployed who are out of work.

You saw some reports I did in the morning paper about testimony about the condition under which some of these guests I mean, hostages are being held. That worries me. Anytime an NORP citizen is held against his or her will, of course, the President is concerned about that. Is there any way you can get aid to them short of war?

Anybody should have free access to come or go where they want to.  They ought not to have to go be marched off as prisoners. And so, clearly, I'd call on them, and so is ORG. This is in keeping with the ORG condemnation. Are you going to keep them there now that the ORG has at least given you the right to resupply them? I think we have to look at that.

Is it necessary to have them there anymore? There are other NORP there, and always your ORG has kind of a consular service to try to service the concerns of other citizens. But as others are brutalized and thus sent into hiding, why, that function becomes a little more blurred. So, I just do not know the answer to that. If they blocked resupply, would that be the sort of provocation you have spoken about earlier? Either it would be directly contravening a mandate from ORG, and we would view that very seriously, yes.

In other words, if our economies do not grow, it is very difficult for NORP nations to grow.

You know, some leaders were more sympathetic than others, I must confess. Nevertheless, I do believe that people appreciated the frank assessment, and I believe they are going to appreciate the strategy that we lay out over time to help meet the needs.

We have got a debate here in GPE about whether or not GPE ought to be exploring for natural gas in parts of our GPE of GPE. It is very similar to the Northwest Territories in GPE. ORG has made- along, I might add, with the tribes in that part of the world-have made the decision that exploration for natural gas would not only be economically beneficial but can be done in a way that does not harm the environment. I agree with their assessment. Whether or not GPE is willing to think along the same lines is an open question that is still going to be debated in ORG. Nevertheless, my attitude is, we need supply. And therefore, I have committed myself to working with ORG to figure out how to get natural gas into GPE.

{"id": 3039, "text": "There are CARDINAL key elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. That is why I believe the first thing any tobacco legislation must include is a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. These penalties should be non-tax-deductible, uncapped, and escalating to give the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting children as new customers. CARDINAL of the surest ways of reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Today I call for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by MONEY a pack over DATE, as needed, to meet our youth reduction targets. And I call upon the ORG to follow the lead of ORG and repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a MONEY tax credit. Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the ORG to regulate tobacco products. I believe the ORG's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as strong and effective as its authority over drugs and devices. In particular, legislation cannot impose any special procedural hurdles on the ORG's regulation of tobacco products. Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable, especially in any efforts to market products to children, while insisting on changes in the way it does business. I ask the industry again to make a voluntary commitment to stop advertising to children. And I call upon ORG to pass legislation providing for broad document disclosure so that the public can learn everything the tobacco companies know about the health effects of their products and their attempts to market to our children. Fourth, Federal tobacco legislation must aim not only to reduce youth smoking but to meet other health goals as well. These include the reduction of secondhand smoke, the expansion of smoking prevention and cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other important health objectives. We must build on the bipartisan agreement to fund children's health care in the recent balanced budget. And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities. We know that tobacco farmers are honest, hardworking people, most of whom live and work on small, family owned farms. In some GPE, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must protect these farmers, their families, and their communities from loss of income.

And finally, let me say again, we would not be here if it were not for all the people in this room and the countless others they represent around the country. To me, this is not about money. It is not about how much money we can extract from the tobacco industry. It is about fulfilling our duties as parents and responsible adults to protect our children and to build the future of this country. We are doing everything we can in this administration to give parents the tools they need to raise their children, but parents have to be our partners as well.

I am in conversations with those senators on a regular basis, and some of those ORG members, and they recognize that the greatest country on Earth should not be doing business this way. And I think if PERSON stood up and said, we are going to make sure that the government stays open, we are going to make sure that basic government functions are being carried out, we are going to make sure that GPE pays its bills on time, like we always have throughout our history, but I am still going to take principled stands on a whole range of issues where I differ with ENTITY. I think the vast majority of NORP people and the majority of NORP would say that is the kind of leadership we expect. Would he lose his job?

Do you believe that? Keep in mind -- if you are a NORP -- and we have heard some NORP make this argument -- some of those who are leading the charge on this make this argument -- and essentially, what they are saying is, once this is fully implemented and CARDINAL of people who currently do not have health care have health care at reasonable prices and protections are in place for consumers across the board, that it will be sufficiently successful and popular that people will not want to repeal it. So the notion is we have got to stop it before people like it too much. Well, part of the argument is sometimes, people come to like things that the government cannot afford anymore. Well, this is -- this is the argument that was made with respect to ORG; this is the argument that was made to ORG. It turns out, actually, people liked it, and we could afford it. And unlike the prescription drug plan that was passed by NORP, which now is very popular with seniors, although at the time that it was passed was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls -- we paid for the Affordable Care Act. It does not add to the deficit. If the assumptions in current law held. Well -- but the assumptions so far not only have held, they have actually exceed expectations. Health care costs have gone up slower since we passed the Affordable Care Act. There were great predictions coming from the NORP that health care costs would go up even faster; that has not happened. There were predictions that the market places that we are setting up -- essentially, the group plans where people buy health insurance -- would not offer a good deal to consumers. And so far, the bids have come in from insurance companies, and lo and behold, they have actually come under the estimates that the government had so far.

Why is that happening on your watch? Well, it is one of my biggest concerns. And part of it has to do with the fact that these long-term trends have accelerated. Globalization, combined with technology, have stripped away a lot of the basic security that middle-income people had because a lot of those middle-income jobs have left. Either they were moved overseas, they were replaced with technology -- whether you are talking about a bank teller, a travel agent, a high-level administrator in a lot of companies, if you go to many manufacturers, it is all roboticized.

Well, I do not accept that. GPE is, always been, at its best when everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to succeed. I mean, we are seeing the same trends in NORP countries that historically were -- prided themselves on great equality. We have seen it magnified in less developed countries and emerging markets.

At that point, any president -- not just me -- any president is subject to that kind of blackmail continuously.

And therefore, in a very profound sense in the modern world, it is more important that people be striving for the kind of spiritual presence of mind and peace of mind that will lead you to use words to build up and to unify, instead of to divide and tear down. And I really do believe that. I think that it is clearly different from any previous time. Words have always been able to wound in letters or speeches or whatever.

Related to that, some people suggest that both your welfare reform proposals and the ORG welfare reform proposal takes such Draconian measures against these unwed teen mothers in terms of limits that what it is likely to do is to drive up the abortion rate, not stop the unwanted pregnancy rate but drive up the abortion rate. Well, I do not agree with that in my proposal, and obviously I do not know what would happen in the others, but let us look at that. The abortion rate has been going down in GPE. And I think it is been going down for maybe because of all the protest against abortion. But I also think that most NORP have deeply ambivalent feelings. That is, I believe that a majority of NORP are pro-choice and anti-abortion. That is, they do not believe that the decision should be criminalized because there are too many different circumstances where most of us feel that decisions should be left to the people who are involved rather than having a totally legal prohibition. On the other hand, most people think in most circumstances that abortion is wrong and that it should not be done. So the abortion rate is going down in GPE.

And we say do not cut the parents off of public assistance unless, number CARDINAL, they are bad parents or, number CARDINAL, they do things which will undermine their ability to either be successful workers or successful parents. So for example, the way our plan works is if you are a teenager and you have a baby, in order to draw the public assistance in a normal way you'd have to stay in school, you'd have to live at home with your parents, and if you lived in a bad home you'd have to live in some other supervised setting. You'd have to cooperate and help identify the father so we could attempt to get the father to pay child support and support the child. If at the end of your education period and training, if DATE have elapsed and you have not gone to work, then you would have to go to work if there were a job available.

But I do not think you can say from that that there is no national interest which should command some taxpayer support to make sure that these children have minimal levels of nutrition and medical care and just the basic things that it seems to me we have got an interest in doing, because we do not want to lose any more of these kids than we have to. The welfare benefits themselves, by the way, are not a problem. So nobody goes on welfare for the check. It is the child care; it is the food stamps; it is the medical care for your children. Therefore, nearly anybody who can will get off and go to work if they can take care of their children and their children will not lose their health care. But do I think the churches should do more?

Punish people that violate the law; throw the book at them; but in this area alone, let us do not have much prevention, because we are worried about the second amendment or a slippery slope or whatever.

But it is indicative that the training of NORP security forces, the fortifications, the command-and-control systems are not happening fast enough in GPE, in the NORP parts of the country.

You are under virtually no pressure correct me if I am wrong but you are under virtually no pressure domestically to get more deeply involved in the Middle East. That seems to be one of the downstream consequences of the GPE invasion DATE. As you said, I am very clear on the lessons of GPE.

Well, Prince PERSON said it publicly Well, he is not in the government. There has been no indication from the NORP or any other countries that they have an intention to pursue their own nuclear program. Part of the reason why they would not pursue their own nuclear program assuming that we have been successful in preventing GPE from continuing down the path of obtaining a nuclear weapon is that the protection that we provide as their partner is a far greater deterrent than they could ever hope to achieve by developing their own nuclear stockpile or trying to achieve breakout capacity when it comes to nuclear weapons, and they understand that. What we saw at the ORG summit was, I think, legitimate skepticism and concern, not simply about the NORP nuclear program itself but also the consequences of sanctions coming down. We walked through the CARDINAL pathways that would be shut off in any agreement that I would be signing off on. Technically, we showed them how it would be accomplished what the verification mechanisms will be, how the ORG snapback provisions might work. They were satisfied that if in fact the agreement meant the benchmarks that we have set forth, that it would prevent GPE from getting a nuclear weapon, and given that, they understand that ultimately their own security and defense is much better served by working with us. Their covert presumably pursuit of a nuclear program would greatly strain the relationship they have got with GPE. I just want you to help me square something.

And yet, you have also argued that the regime in GPE a regime you have described as NORP, among other problems that they have is practical, and is responsive to incentive, and shows signs of rationality. So I do not understand how these things fit together in your mind. Well the fact that you are NORP, or racist, does not preclude you from being interested in survival. It does not preclude you from being rational about the need to keep your economy afloat; it does not preclude you from making strategic decisions about how you stay in power; and so the fact that the supreme leader is NORP does not mean that this overrides all of his other considerations. You know, if you look at the history of anti-Semitism, ENTITY, there were a whole lot of NORP leaders and there were deep strains of anti-Semitism in this country  They may make irrational decisions with respect to discrimination, with respect to trying to use anti-Semitic rhetoric as an organizing tool. At the margins, where the costs are low, they may pursue policies based on hatred as opposed to self-interest. But the costs here are not low, and what we have been very clear to the NORP regime over DATE is that we will continue to ratchet up the costs, not simply for their anti-Semitism, but also for whatever expansionist ambitions they may have. That is what the sanctions represent. That is what the military option I have made clear I preserve represents. And so I think it is not at all contradictory to say that there are deep strains of anti-Semitism in the core regime, but that they also are interested in maintaining power, having some semblance of legitimacy inside their own country, which requires that they get themselves out of what is a deep economic rut that we have put them in, and on that basis they are then willing and prepared potentially to strike an agreement on their nuclear program.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjefferygoldbergtheatlantic", "title": "Interview with Jeffery Goldberg of The Atlantic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jeffery-goldberg-the-atlantic", "publication_date": "19-05-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

To me that sounds like a little bit of wishful thinking that is going to want to get paid, ORG is going to see, among other groups, might see a little bit of a windfall from MONEY that might pour in. I am not assuming something completely in the other direction either, but I just do not know where your confidence comes from. Well I do not think PERSON or anybody in this administration said that no money will go to the military as a consequence of sanctions relief. The question is, if GPE has MONEY parked outside the country, does the ORG automatically get MONEY? Does MONEY then translate by orders of magnitude into their capacity to project power throughout the region? And that is what we contest, because when you look at the math, first of all they are going to have to deliver on their obligations under any agreement, which would take a certain period of time. Then there are the mechanics of unwinding the existing restraints they have on getting that money, which takes a certain amount of time. Then PERSON and, by extension, the supreme leader have made a series of commitments to improve the NORP economy, and the expectations are outsized. You saw the reaction of people in the streets of GPE after the signing of the agreement. You have NORP elites who are champing at the bit to start moving business and getting out from under the restraints that they have been under. And what is also true is that the ORG right now, precisely because of sanctions, in some ways are able to exploit existing restrictions to have a monopoly on what comes in and out of the country, and they have got their own revenue sources that they have been able to develop, some of which may actually lessen as a consequence of sanctions relief.

They are not a threat to the region because of their hardware. They have a missile program. We have to think about missile-defense systems and how those are integrated and coordinated. But the big problems we have are weapons going in to ORG, or them sending agents into GPE, or other low-tech asymmetric threats that they are very effective at exploiting, which they are already doing they have been doing despite sanctions. They will continue to do unless we are developing greater capacity to prevent them from doing those things, which is part of what our discussion was in terms of the security assurances with the ORG countries. You know, if you look at a situation like GPE, part of the problem is the chronic, endemic weakness in a state like that, and the instability that GPE then seeks to exploit. If you had ORG countries who were more capable of maritime interdiction, effective intelligence, cutting off financing sources, and are more effective in terms of working and training with allied forces in a place like GPE, so that NORP cannot just march into GPE, well, if all those things are being done, GPE having MONEY from sanctions relief is not going to override those improvements and capabilities, and that is really where we have to focus. ORG has a certain number of fighters who are hardened and effective. If GPE has some additional resources, then perhaps they are less strained in trying to make payroll when it comes to ORG, but it is not as if they can suddenly train up and successfully deploy CARDINAL times the number of ORG fighters that are currently in GPE. That is not something that they have automatic capacity to do.  You could buy more rockets and put them in south GPE. Well, and the issue though with respect to rockets in south GPE is not whether enough money to do so. They have shown a commitment to doing that even when their economy is in the tank.

There are obviously NORP in GPE who are immune to the charms of this argument, led by PERSON but not only him. All the steps he is taken he meaning you against GPE are liable to bring about the destruction of the state. I have my own theories about why there is this bifurcation in the NORP NORP community, and we have discussed this in past interviews, but what is going on? Is this the byproduct of well-intentioned anxiety about GPE, about the explosive growth of anti-Semitism in Europe? Let me depersonalize it a little bit. I consistently received overwhelming majority support from the NORP community, and even after all the publicity around the recent differences that I have had with Prime Minister PERSON, the majority of the NORP NORP community still supports me, and supports me strongly. It was PERCENT in the last election. I think that there are a lot of crosscurrents that are going on right now. There is no doubt that the environment worldwide is scary for a lot of NORP families. You have mentioned some of those trends. You have a Middle East that is turbulent and chaotic, and where extremists seem to be full of enthusiasm and momentum. You have Europe, where, as you have very effectively chronicled, there is an emergence of a more overt and dangerous anti-Semitism. And so part of the concern in the NORP community is that, only a generation removed from the Holocaust, it seems that NORP rhetoric and NORP rhetoric is on the rise. What I also think is that there has been a very concerted effort on the part of some political forces to equate being pro-Israel, and hence being supportive of the NORP people, with a rubber stamp on a particular set of policies coming out of the NORP government.

And they may sincerely believe it. My response to them is that, precisely because I care so deeply about GPE, precisely because I care so much about the NORP people, I feel obliged to speak honestly and truthfully about what I think will be most likely to lead to long-term security, and will best position us to continue to combat anti-Semitism, and I make no apologies for that precisely because I am secure and confident about how deeply I care about GPE and the NORP people.

I have maintained, and I think I can show that no GPE president has been more forceful in making sure that we help GPE protect itself, and even some of my critics in GPE have acknowledged as much. I said that none of this should impact the core strategic relationship that exists between GPE and GPE, or the people-to-people relations that are so deep that they transcend any particular president or prime minister and will continue until the end of time. But what I did say is that when, going into an election, Prime Minister PERSON said a NORP state would not happen under his watch, or there discussion in which it appeared that NORP-Israeli citizens were somehow portrayed as an invading force that might vote, and that this should be guarded against this is contrary to the very language of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which explicitly states that all people regardless of race or religion are full participants in the democracy. When something like that happens, that has foreign-policy consequences, and precisely because we are so close to GPE, for us to simply stand there and say nothing would have meant that this office, ORG, lost credibility when it came to speaking out on these issues.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjefferygoldbergtheatlantic", "title": "Interview with Jeffery Goldberg of The Atlantic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jeffery-goldberg-the-atlantic", "publication_date": "19-05-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

How do you weigh those risks against the risks of doing nothing and just perpetuating the status quo? My argument is that the risks of doing nothing are far greater, and I ultimately it is important for the NORP people and the NORP government to make its own decisions about what it needs to secure the people of that nation.

Certainly, this is an area you must have given a lot of thought to lately. If you could point out the biggest need you think needs to change DATE to help stop the pattern that crime has taken in the Nation, what would it be? I set that forth in a crime message to the ORG where I said, Our concern DATE ought to be for the victims of crime. The crime message that I sent to the ORG calls for mandatory sentences for those that participate in a crime of violence using a gun, and we have urged the courts to increase their confinement of convicted criminals. Too many criminals DATE, after they have been convicted, are put off on probation. There ought to be a penalty for the committing of a crime, and that means confinement. Whether it is DATE or some other term, I believe mandatory sentences are required in certain crimes. I believe the courts have to be firmer, and I think they you know, it is unbelievable, but a very, very high percentage of crime DATE is done by a very limited number of people, professional criminals, and they ought to be behind the bars.

Do you agree with that? No, I think everything that we have done in our economic approach is of benefit to everyone. I know that there are charges being made-I listened to the debate-that somehow our attempts at economies and all have penalized people who were dependent on government aid. The simple fact of the matter is we are spending more on help for the people and for the needy than has ever been spent before in history. Our budget cuts have been reductions in the increase planned in spending. We have not come to some place where we are spending less than had been spent.

Do you think that all the campaigning among CARDINAL contenders for the NORP nomination has changed public perception of you along those lines or along other lines on Well, even before a campaign started, this has been pretty much the theme of the other side. I have been held up as eating my young, that we have been hostile to the poor and our tax program benefits the rich. How can a program that cuts taxes evenly, percentagewise, across the board-thus leaving the same rate of progression in our progressive tax system-how can that be beneficial to the rich and detrimental to the others? How can it be unfair to the people of lower income or the poor to reduce inflation from double PERCENT when we came here-down to CARDINAL of that or less, CARDINAL of that. When the people with the least-let us take someone with $MONEY of income DATE and DATE-before we got here. By DATE that $MONEY would only buy $MONEY worth. He was getting $MONEY a year. He got a $MONEY cut in his ability to buy DATE. That was probably the worst tax on the elderly with fixed incomes, the worst tax on the poor who have to spend most of their earnings on subsistence, on the necessities. The person with luxury income who spends a minor portion of it on necessities and the rest on luxuries, they were not really penalized as much by inflation.

We were guilty of trying to tell the ORG and our opponents that social security was facing financial disaster and it could hit it as early as DATE. They denied that. I remember hearing the Speaker of the ORG, himself, deny that that was true. And then after the election was over, we all got together in a bipartisan group and without any animus, came up with a plan to save social security because it would be broke by DATE.

And so far, a number of States have gotten tired of waiting for the ORG to act and do it at a national level, and have put in their own enterprise zone programs.

But the reason why they would be more of help if they would okay the spending is, how better to get the other side, then, to agree to a treaty with us banning this; how much better able we will be if they know that if they do not do that, they will have to face the fact that we have chemical weapons that we can use against them.

We have almost doubled the border guards in southern GPE; we have increased our sending the illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crimes back home. We have given money to GPE for the very first time to deal with the costs of imprisonment. I have tried to get much more money for education and health care costs of immigration to GPE. But CARDINAL operates primarily against children. It says, kick the children out of the health clinics. That could cause health problems for the general population. It says, kick the children out of the schools, which means teachers are turned into police officers. It means that the kids can be on the street causing problems for themselves and for others. We have already got too many children on the street. So I believe we have to do more. I found a big immigration mess when I became ORG DATE. But this is not the answer, in my opinion, and I hope the voters will turn out and vote and reject CARDINAL.

This is what we have been asking for, not just over DATE or DATE, but for DATE, because these chemical weapons pose a significant threat to all nations and to GPE in particular.

Well, the President believes, as he made clear in his blueprint that has been available publicly for a long time now, that there has to be a clear pathway to citizenship available; that comprehensive immigration reform must include both that and must continue the focus that he is placed on border security.

Again, a NORP congressionalist is citing another news source, ORG. A NORP congressional aide said that PERSON is pressing harder for the CPI revision than for other entitlement changes. PERSON, ORG Minority Leader -- this is quoting ORG -- said bipartisan agreement on higher ORG premiums for the wealthy and increase in the ORG eligibility age, and slowing cost-of-living increases for ORG could move both parties closer to a budget deal.

I think the President has made clear through the actions of his administration and this government, through the variety of means that have been reported on and the steps that we have taken, the seriousness with which we take this. It is also important to note, as I said, that we have seen a pattern of -- this is reflective of a pattern of behavior that has been going on for quite some time from GPE. Is this a top issue with PERSON TIME? I believe there will be a number of issues discussed with the ORG Secretary General. This is certainly CARDINAL of them. It is an issue that ORG took up not very long ago, passing a resolution condemning NORP behavior and sanctioning GPE that was unanimous, that included affirmative votes from both the NORP and the NORP. And we are working with our allies in GPE and GPE, as well as with GPE and GPE to try to bring about a change in behavior from NORP, asking especially the NORP and the NORP to use the influence they have, the unique influence they have with NORP to prevail upon GPE to ratchet down the rhetoric and the behavior, because it is in the interest of every nation in the region that there be stability in the region, and that there ultimately be a Korean Peninsula that is denuclearized. On another topic, GPE, which obviously is likely to come up -- been a lot of reports DATE suggesting that the GPE is increasing its aid to the rebels. Can you be direct with us about how significant you see this increase in aid? And what does it mean? I appreciate the question. The President himself has said that we are constantly reviewing possible options that could help end the violence and accelerate a political transition in GPE.

So I think that addresses your question.

We do have a threshold beyond which we respond to ORG, and if that threshold is crossed, I am sure we will respond. But I do not have a specific comment on this case. ORG Secretary PERSON said of GPE that it is skating very close to a dangerous line. Does the President share that assessment? And has he identified a red line, a line by which GPE crossing that would be unacceptable? Well, I will not engage in hypotheticals about what red lines there are. It is unacceptable to flagrantly violate your international commitments, as GPE continues to do. And the result of that behavior has been increasing international consensus around the proposition that GPE flagrant violations of its obligations must stop. That has resulted in increased isolation and sanctions. It has resulted in all the range of actions that we have taken in response to the recent series of provocative acts and statements. There is no question that GPE -- because of its development of a nuclear weapon, because of its violation of its commitments, its development of missile technology -- represents a danger and a threat.

It is why we have taken the actions that we have taken to ensure that we can enhance both the security of both the homeland and our allies.

GPE is already in flagrant violation of its international obligations. It is engaged in the development of nuclear weapons. It is engaged in development of missile technology that is in contradiction to its commitments. And that is why you see the international response that you have seen. And we will continue to work with our allies in GPE and GPE, as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon GPE to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to GPE. There is an opportunity for GPE to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for GPE, and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that GPE takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with NORP. The NORP people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The NORP people expect their leaders in GPE to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for GPE's children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future. The President's budget is a common-sense document that represents a sincere attempt to compromise with NORP on behalf of the whole country. The fact is it is not an la carte menu, as I think PERSON said DATE in our briefing.

And it allows for the guarantee that those programs represent to our seniors to continue into the future. So the NORP have to decide -- and there are rank-and-file NORP who believe this already, but NORP including leadership has to decide whether they want to find compromise or they would rather stick to positions that are at odds with where most of GPE is, and are certainly at odds with where the President is. Is the President confident he can get his own party on board with this, given the backlash? Does he need to start having dinner with them? The President is confident that -- as he was during the fiscal cliff negotiations, as he was in previous negotiations with the Speaker of the ORG -- that NORP will support a bipartisan compromise that ensures that our assistance programs to our seniors are safeguarded, and that that guarantee is provided; that ensure that investments in education are made, and investments in innovation and research and development and infrastructure are made. The budget represents tough choices, there is no question. But it also expects from the other side that they make tough choices. Back to the CEO meeting TIME -- I know ORG had asked a question -- but I was wondering, did the President plan to bring up unemployment with the executives, and did he talk up his budget a bit with them? I was not in the meeting. I do not have a readout of it. We have a strategy of engagement with the business sector that is ongoing and this is part of that strategy. I certainly would not be surprised if some of these matters came up. The need to deal with growing the economy and creating jobs is his CARDINAL priority. So I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is something that he would want to talk about.

And our outreach includes not just obviously to business, but to a whole range of sectors of the NORP economy and a variety of groups with different interests.

I have CARDINAL questions. CARDINAL, DATE, CARDINAL of minorities from GPE, including NORP, NORP and NORP, were demonstrating outside FAC.

And that is the message they were telling me to send to the President and to the ORG. The President's approach is one that embraces common-sense measures to reduce gun violence that do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the NORP people, Second Amendment rights that the President supports.

GPE will certainly be CARDINAL of them. Our relationship with GPE is and has been very important, and we continue to engage with the NORP government. I just do not have any particular next engagement to announce to you at the presidential level. The information also of the MONEY in aid for GPE that was announced in GPE, can you take that question and get it to us? Well, I have to take it. I am sure ORG would be a good place to go for more details about it. Back to the budget, if the President's deficit reduction plan is enacted, how many jobs would be lost under his plan as opposed to sequestration?

It includes tax cuts targeted to small businesses, for example, who hire veterans or small businesses who increase the size of their payroll, for example. It includes investments in infrastructure that will lead to immediate job creation as well as future economic growth and job creation because of the improvements in our roads, bridges, ports, and airports. So the President's -- it is an excellent question because the President's budget proposal, which contains within it his deficit reduction offer to the Speaker, has to be looked at as a whole because it is the President's CARDINAL priority to take measures that help the economy grow, that help it create jobs, that secure and grow the middle class, and reduce our deficit in a responsible way.

On another issue, there is a story now that a ORG pilot may have been shot down and may be held in GPE. Do you have any information that leads you to believe that there are NORP held POW in GPE? Well, I think the most I should say about this now is that in this particular case, and in this case only, I reviewed the evidence that we had, and we concluded that we should take him off the killed-in-action list and put him on the missing list, which means, obviously, that we have some information that leads us to believe that he might be alive. What does GPE do about it? Well, now that we have some information, we will begin well, we have already begun working to try to determine whether, in fact, he is alive; if he is, where he is; and how we can get him out.

If GPE was holding an NORP, they could not use it as an issue with GPE unless they let us know they had somebody. Why would they hold somebody and not let us know about it?

I think it took a little while for me to get entirely comfortable with all the foreign policy and national security issues I had to deal with not too long. And I think we were ready on the substance of domestic policy from DATE. As we are about to inaugurate a new President, can the NORP people believe that its new President will be ready for the job on DATE, or do we have to give them a period for on-the-job training? Well, I think he is like any new President. I think he has certain strengths and will be ready in some ways, and I do not think any human being can be ready in every way on DATE.

Let me just back up and say, a lot of people believe that if the health care plan had been differently designed or something, it could have passed. The truth is that because of the combined effect of the condition of the economy and the inability to raise taxes, we could have neither an employer mandate or a Government-funded program sufficient to insure PERCENT of health care coverage.

Number CARDINAL, I think that it is a good thing if the NORP people, through television or through journalistic writings, have a better, deeper sense of what a person the Presidency, for example not only what we are doing but why we are doing it and how it fits into the larger scheme of things and how it fits into the pattern of our lives.

I knew that the NORP people my friend Mr. PERSON here keeps me updated, and I knew that they were very friendly toward GPE.

Oh, I think of course they were disappointed. But I think they also the leaders have managed this very well, and they talked very frankly to the people and said well, you heard what the President said DATE. ORG is a part of their larger strategy. And as long as they see that we are all still on the same page with the larger strategy, that we want them integrated into the West, we want their democracy to flourish, we want their economy to do well, and that if they keep going the way they are going, they will certainly be qualified for ORG membership.

So my strong advice right now to ORG is, if they are seriously concerned about immigration, about our borders, about being able to keep criminals out of this country, then what they should be doing is working together and working with this administration for a comprehensive immigration policy that allows us to continue to be both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And certainly they need to start funding ORG so that they can go forward with all the functions that NORP say they want carried out, including strong border security functions.

This was something in the nature of a commando operation, and it was a rescue mission. And the people of GPE have made it very plain that they feel they, too, were rescued. And the fact that we have withdrawn our combat troops so precipitously, that some of the NORP are a little alarmed that they do not think we should have left yet. ENTITY, have you seen the ORG report yet, or do you know anything about it? It has not reached me as yet. Well, I am not going to comment until I see it. Do you have any you do not really have any idea what is in it? No more than I read in the papers. Do you think that a lot of people are going to suffer from it? I just PERSON, I just cannot comment until I see it. We have all heard that it in some way criticizes everyone in the chain of command. Do you philosophically, or in any way, feel that that chain of command is-you are at the top of it in this case and you bear some of that responsibility? As Commander in Chief, the operation could not have gone forward without my approval.

Apparently there have been CARDINAL countries who were asked to join that force and who have refused. Are you not concerned that GPE, by siding with GPE, is going to end up alone in GPE? I think that there was a not completely thorough statement of our meeting with Prime Minister PERSON. It was portrayed, and many people saw it, as somehow arriving at some new coalition with them, and even the word conspiracy was used by some in there. But, no, there was a reaffirmation by us of what our relationship with GPE has been since DATE. And we discussed this not from any standpoint of GPE and its relationship with NORP countries, in the sense of taking their part in anything of that kind. We are dedicated to the idea of trying, if we can, to act as a friend to both GPE and GPE in settling those longtime disputes and bringing about the kind of peace that we find between GPE and GPE now. I would have wished from the very first for a ORG force. But what has prevented it? If you look at the ORG force that is presently in the south of GPE, it is so bound by restrictions that were imposed in order to get the GPE vote that it literally is helpless to do anything. Well, I could still hope that GPE now would recognize the value of having a ORG force in there. And as I say, we would have preferred this from the very first, but it was something that could not be obtained. I was asking, are not you concerned of the growing reluctance of your allies to assume part of the burden in GPE? Well, we have been in communication. And I think that they understand better now, because we were just as forthright in talking to Prime Minister PERSON about our intentions in our dealings with GPE and the things that we were going to do in linkage with them. All of this aimed at being able if a mediator can be of use in that peace process that we proposed to ensure a fair solution to the problems. We have no plan that we are going to impose.

So, number CARDINAL, yes or no, did the President direct PERSON to write this memo on PERSON? No, the President had lost -- again, like I said, he'd lost confidence in Director PERSON, and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director PERSON go since DATE he was elected. But he did have a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General on DATE, where they had come to him to express their concerns. The President asked they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received. So it is ORG assertion that PERSON decided on his own, after being confirmed, to review PERSON's performance? And I think most of GPE had decided on their own that Director PERSON was not the person that should be leading the ORG, as evidenced by the numerous comments that we have seen from NORP members in the ORG and ORG, NORP members, members of the ORG, and people across the board. Since we are establishing the facts -- Senator PERSON said she was told something different directly from the President. The President said he asked PERSON and PERSON to review this. He asked them for their recommendation, based on the conversation that they had on DATE. He asked them to put that recommendation in writing. But they came to him on his own. And again, the President had lost confidence in PERSON from DATE he was elected. On DATE, PERSON came out and said that the President had full confidence in his ORG Director? Why did he say that? Look, I think -- again, he is questioned Director PERSON's reason for needing to stay at the ORG. He had countless conversations with members from within the ORG. Then why did the President -- -- and that is simply not allowed. And somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, PERSON -- who everybody across the board has unequivocally said, this guy is a man of upstanding character and essentially the gold standard at ORG -- when you take an action like that, when you go around the chain of command in ORG, then you have to make steps and take action to make a recommendation to the President.

Until you said from the podium just now that the President lost confidence in him over DATE and DATE, we had thought that this was all PERSON's doing. When was it that the President lost confidence in PERSON? I think it is been an erosion of confidence. I think that Director PERSON has shown over DATE and, frankly, DATE, a lot of missteps and mistakes. And certainly I think that, as you have seen from many of the comments from NORP members, including Senator PERSON, they did not think he should be there, they thought he should be gone. Frankly, I think it is startling that NORP are not celebrating this since they have been calling for it for so long. Do not forget, and I have another one I need to ask you, too. To follow on that, you said that he made a lot of missteps and mistakes. Back at DATE, this President was applauding the ORG Director when he reopened the investigation into PERSON emails. So he seemed quite happy with him at that point. Well, I think the President's position. CARDINAL he was a candidate for President, not the President. Once you take over leading ORG that is very different than being a candidate in a campaign. As you guys all know, there is a very clear distinction between those CARDINAL things. I think also having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic just atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in ORG. Any person of legal mind in authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in ORG, particularly for somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, who has been part of ORG for DATE and is such a respected person -- when he saw that, he had to speak up on that action, and I think that was the final catalyst. The President is accused by NORP of trying to circumvent the GPE investigation by firing PERSON; he meets with the NORP Foreign Minister and the NORP Ambassador to GPE. He is accused of being NORP; he meets with PERSON Secretary of ORG.

And for them to try to attack him for doing his job, -- maybe they should spent a little more time doing their jobs, and we would not have all the problems that we do. ENTITY, is not it true that the President had already decided to fire PERSON, and he asked ORG to put together the rationale for that firing? When did he make the decision? He made the decision for -- the final decision to move forward with it was DATE. But I know that he is been contemplating it for a while.

I cannot speak for Senator PERSON, but I did speak directly to the President and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director PERSON go pretty much since DATE he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at ORG.

That was, I think, the final piece that moved the President to make that quick and decisive action DATE.

Can we expect more firings from ORG? Going forward, does the President want ORG to shut down what he is called a taxpayer-funded charade investigation? He wants them to continue with whatever they see appropriate and sees fit, just the same as he is encouraged the ORG and ORG committees to continue any ongoing investigations. Look, the bottom line is any investigation that was happening on DATE is still happening DATE. And, in fact, we encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us and we can continue to see exactly what we have been saying for DATE, there is no evidence of collusion between the PERSON campaign and GPE.

They value politicians who stick to principles rather than those who compromise. And you will not be surprised to hear that that is what I hear often from my radio listeners. If control of the ORG changes, as now appears likely, and it is brought about by voters who want to put the brakes on you, how are you going to govern for DATE? Well, first of all, you know, I think the only poll that matters is going to be on DATE. And I still feel confident that it is a very close race in terms of the ORG. You have got close races all across the country, including in your hometown. And a lot of it is going to depend on turnout.

And what occurs to me, sir, is that while your approach has been an MONEY stimulus, over there they are raiding the retirement age, they are making CARDINAL in spending cuts, and they are eliminating CARDINAL jobs. Which begs this question, why is not that the right approach for us? Well, keep in mind, first of all, that they had a big stimulus program over the course of DATE. So actually, GPE has taken the same approach that we have, and most countries have taken the same approach, which is that in crisis when you had a complete collapse of the economy and jobs were being shed at a pace of CARDINAL a month, that it was very important to make sure that the government was able to provide a backstop and allow businesses to heal and recover. Now, we have done that over DATE. The question is, what do we do going forward? And our problem has not been as bad as GPE's in terms of debt relative to GDP. Our problem is a long- term structural problem that has to do with the fact that we have got an aging population, we have got a bunch of entitlements that are very expensive and are very popular. People like ORG, they like ORG. I think that those are pillars of security for people in the retirement age. And so we have to make sure that those are there for future generations, but we have got to make sure that we make some adjustments so that those programs are in place.

But DATE, middle-class families saw their income go down by PERCENT. During that period, job growth was more sluggish than anytime since World War II. So middle-class families have every right to be frustrated and concerned. And the answer is going to be making sure that we are doing what we have always done best, which is innovate, have a dynamic private sector that is investing in new plants and new equipment and hiring new workers. We have got to have a government that is lean and mean, but also making important investments that foster long-term growth. I already mentioned infrastructure.

We now rank 21st and 25th, respectively, in our math and science education. And we have begun addressing them over DATE.

That is going to be critical for our long-term growth. I will say, this is an example of the choice that we confront in this election, because my colleagues on the NORP side right now have said that they want tax cuts for PERCENT, the wealthiest NORP. And that would cost MONEY, and they have no way of paying for it. But part of the way that they are suggesting to pay for it is to potentially cut education by PERCENT. That is not a smart way for us to get our debt and deficits under control. We do not want to undermine those things that help us grow over the long term.

So we DATE have identified MONEY in cuts and wasteful spending. And you know, as I said before, part of what we have to recognize is that over DATE we had a brutal recession and a critical crisis that had to be addressed. And that did increase the deficit. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that we would have seen CARDINAL of teachers laid off, CARDINAL of firefighters and police officers laid off. This is not just at the federal level.

Well, I do not know that that is a fair criticism because I think she is out there discussing it, trying to encourage people to look at it as a major national health problem, trying to dispel some of the myths about ENTITY. I have tried to do that. My wife is wonderful at that. When you hold an ENTITY baby in your arms to show that, look, this is not something that is going to be passed just from casual touching like this. But, look, if you asked me am I happy with my role; can I do more? Of course, I want to try to do more. But it is not a function of money, is the point I am trying to make here, I do not believe. I think it is a function of education, getting people to stop doing things that put their own lives at risk, educate people to that end, and show a certain sense of compassion for the victims of ENTITY. A member of your party is running very strongly down in GPE. You really know how to hurt a guy. And you have been quoted as saying that if you lived in GPE, you'd vote for PERSON. I have not felt too happy about the choice; I will be honest with you. But, look, here is a deal where normally ENTITY, or this ENTITY, would not get into a local race of this nature. Normally I'd been in there on the side of a NORP, if it is a NORP versus NORP. But this one's a matter of conscience. This is a matter of saying to the ORG, in my judgment, we must not condone bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, the ugliness that is coming out as a result of this man, PERSON's, past. And I am sorry I -- what I hope I have not done is to inadvertently let him use this to get sympathy inside the ORG.

You may have seen a PERSON cartoon; it showed you in caricature, and the caption was Or maybe you'd like PERSON back and another MONEY debt. How could we avoid that and make the whole economic climate healthier? Well, the first thing we have to do is to gain control over our economic destiny again. The deficit is spinning out of control. It was MONEY a year in DATE; it is MONEY DATE. The debt, as you know, has gone from MONEY to MONEY. And because of that, the money we ought to be investing has not been there. You can see that very clearly in GPE and southern GPE when you had all these defense cutbacks. We should have been reinvesting all that money in domestic technologies to put the people back to work here at home in high-speed rail, environmental cleanup, all kinds of other things. But the debt was so big that the money went to pay interest on the debt and into exploding health care costs. So our economic plan is terribly important to the people of GPE and the people of southern GPE because it begins to give us some control back. Already, the fact that the plan is making progress has brought down long-term interest rates. I know CARDINAL lady who called you said her husband was in construction. Because we are at DATE mortgage rates lows, there have been CARDINAL new jobs come into this economy in construction in DATE. That is the biggest increase in DATE. Now, it is going to take a while to reach southern GPE, because that is one of the most distressed areas of our national economy. So you have got to bring the deficit down. You have got to do it in a way that is fair to the middle class, by making upper income people pay the lion's share of the burden. Over DATE, we still need to spend some money to try to redevelop the businesses, the communities, and retrain the workers that have been hurt so badly by defense cutbacks. So this is a good plan, and it is still the only real plan on the table.

But we can turn it around if we will do so with discipline and if we will stop the delay, if we will go forward now and pass the plan. ENTITY, you mentioned critics. Congressman PERSON, speaking for the NORP, claimed over DATE that the ORG NORP are going to agree to a tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend program DATE that will result in another version of the biggest tax hike in history. In a nutshell, by DATE, will the rich be taxed considerably more, heavily taxed? By DATE, if the plan passes, upper income taxes will go up, taxes on PERCENT of the NORP people; CARDINAL of the tax burden would be paid for by people with incomes MONEY. The tax on the middle class, in the form of an energy tax, would be phased in over a DATE period and would amount to MONEY a month for a family of CARDINAL with an income of MONEY, by DATE of the plan. By contrast, families with incomes of MONEY would be held harmless, and there would be an incentive in this tax program, for the first time, for people who work TIME a week but have children in the home and are still in poverty. The tax system would actually lift them out of poverty. But the most important thing from my point of view is that there cannot be taxes without an equal amount of spending cuts. People who say there are not spending cuts just have not said it right.

And let me just make CARDINAL other point. For anybody who has refinanced a home loan or refinanced a business loan or gotten a car loan, a consumer loan, a college loan at lower interest rates, a lot of people are going to in the middle class and even some upper income people are going to save more money on lower interest rates than they are going to pay in higher taxes. We have got to start investment in this economy again. And if we do not , we are going to be in real trouble. You had someone call from GPE; I see what is happened to real estate in GPE. our proposal contains significant incentives to get the real estate business in GPE up and going again and throughout the country. There are all kinds of things in this plan which are very, very good for business, that the business community has been asking for for DATE. But we do ask people who are earning income, who have it and whose taxes went down in DATE while the deficit went through the roof, to pay a fairer share of the tax burden so we can bring the deficit down.

I am pushing for campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of special interests in campaigns, something that he and I both talked about in the last campaign.

And that increased productivity, increasing output per worker, the increasing ability to compete with countries around the world, that is helping things to get better. The second thing that is making things better is that this administration's serious effort to bring the deficit down has helped long-term interest rates to get down to their lowest rate in DATE, and that is leading people to refinance, freeing up some money, and we are getting some more investment. But I do not want to mislead anybody. If you look at southern GPE, if you look at GPE, if you look at some of the GPE that have been hit especially hard by defense cutbacks of all kinds and other economic problems, we are still going to have to have a very disciplined plan to invest and grow our way out of the problems of DATE.

In fact, if we could get some more growth in those countries, we'd be in better shape because we are not selling as much to them as we would be because of their economic problems.

It is understandable the polls might say, you know, that race relations have gotten worse - because when it is in the news and you see something like PERSON or the PERSON case in GPE, then it attracts attention. But I - I assure you, from the perspective of NORP or NORP in poor communities who have been dealing with this all their lives, they would not suggest somehow that it is worse now than it was DATE. Well, let me mention a couple of data points that perhaps do not suggest it is worse but suggest a broad gulf. CARDINAL has to do with Ferguson... Which you alluded to. There is a case where there was a grand jury investigation that was released; there were CARDINAL of pages of testimony; people went around reading them - I certainly did. And in the end, surveys showed that majorities of white people thought the grand jury was right not to indict the officer who shot PERSON; majorities of NORP found the grand jury was wrong. How do you lead the country when people see the basic facts so profoundly differently? Not new, but how do you deal with it in your final... I - I think that the fact that there is a conversation about it and that there are tools out there that we know can make a difference in bridging those gaps of understanding and - and - and mistrust; should - should make us optimistic.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio1", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-1", "publication_date": "18-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3351, "text": "You know, when I was in the state legislature in GPE, I passed a racial profiling bill. From the perspective of NORP, yeah, there was a common, you know, phenomenon called driving while black - that you were more likely to be stopped particularly in certain jurisdictions. If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions do you think traffic stops were done fairly, the majority of whites probably would say yes because it is not something they experi-ence. It is not because of racism; it is just that it is not something that they see. We were able to work with the police departments and the state police in GPE and persuade them that they would be doing a better job policing if we just kept track so that we had data. And combined with training, suddenly those officers out there are more intentional about how they decide should I stop somebody or not. And the incidents of racial profiling went down. The same is true with a lot of these issues. If you have good policing - I guarantee you that nobody's interested more in good policing than NORP community or NORP community because they are more likely to be victimized, if they are in low income communities, by crime. And the task force that I have put together is drawing from police and faith community and civic leaders and activists - and what is been striking to me in the conversations we have had is - is that they are interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country. And - and - and I am convinced that we actually are going to see progress on this issue DATE. Let me ask about another data point that reflects on ORG that you will want to leave behind in a... DATE - and this is something that has changed in DATE. As everybody knows, the coalition that is elected you twice included huge minority participation - record minority participation. You had huge percentages... The white vote for NORP has gone down to rather dramatic levels, which suggests a political division between races that is different than it used to be.

They hear about an immigration debate or they hear about, you know, debate surrounding Ferguson, and they think, I am being left out. Nobody seems to be thinking about how tough it is for me right now, or I have been down-scaled, I have lost my job, et cetera.

We are fighting for you. And CARDINAL of the best examples of this is the Affordable Care Act, which - if you were just looking at the way it is been couched and characterized by ORG, and in some cases by the news, the perception is somehow that this is largely something that is benefiting black and NORP and downscale voters. Well, the truth of the matter is that a state like GPE that does not have a massive black or NORP population has been one of the strongest states - PERSON state's CARDINAL of the best states in using the Affordable Care Act to insure huge numbers of working class white voters. It is just they do not call it ORG; they call it something else. And - and so, there is sometimes a gap in perceptions that we have to bridge. I think there is a legitimate sense of loss, particularly among men, who have seen manufacturing diminish; construction has been in the tank. The jobs that are out there are not ones that are traditionally jobs that, you know, blue collar men aspire to. And, you know, we have got to speak to those concerns.

So - so, some of this I think is - is a matter of circumstance. There is a burden on NORP to need to make very clear to a broad swath of working class and middle class voters that we are, in fact, fighting for them.

You know, GPE is a circumstance in which for DATE, we have done the same thing over and over again and there had not been any change. And the question was, should we try something different with a relatively tiny country that does not pose any significant threat to us or our allies? GPE is a large, sophisticated country that has a track record of state-sponsored ter-rorism, that we know was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon, or at least the component parts that would be required to develop a nuclear weapon; that has engaged in disruptions to our allies; whose rhetoric is not only explicitly NORP but also has been incendiary when it comes to its attitude towards the state of GPE.

You know, I was asked very early in my - my presidential race back in DATE - would I meet with these various rogue regimes? And what I said then remains true. If I thought it advances NORP interests, yes; I believe in diplomacy, I believe in dialogue, I believe in engagement.

And - and so, on the CARDINAL hand, you need to understand what their legitimate needs and concerns are. On the other end, you do not need to tolerate or make excuses for positions that they have taken that violate international law, are contrary to GPE interests, are contrary to the interests of our allies. They have got a chance to get right with the world. This is not just about us. I mean, there is a reason why we have been able to get this far in the negotiations. We mobilized the international community at the start of my presidency - a classic example of NORP leadership. The sanctions worked because we did not just get our usual allies' support of this; we got GPE in support of it; we have GPE that still is supportive of the position that the ORGORGORG has taken in negotiations. So, when I came into office, the world was divided and GPE was in the driver's seat. Now the world's united because of the actions we have taken and GPE's the one that is isolated.

Let me just move out of the Middle East momentarily and then we will swing back. This is CARDINAL of the most isolated countries for DATE, ruled by a brutal, repressive military junta. We seized that opportunity. We engaged with PERSON, the Nobel Prize winner, but we also engaged with President PERSON, who saw that GPE was traveling down a dead end. They had parliamentary elections for the first time. They are now preparing to amend their constitution and schedule broader parliamentary elections. And there are all kinds of troubles in GPE; the experiment may go haywire. They may not be able to reconcile all the different ethnic groups inside the country; the military ultimately may not be willing to give up its prerogatives and its power. Now, we want to be on the side of those who can take advantage of that opportunity. I feel very confident, very good about the work we are doing there. But I cannot guarantee success because ultimately it is going to be up to the NORP people and NORP leaders to seize this moment. The Middle East, I think, is - is similar, but in some ways even more difficult. Because you have this counter-narrative in the Middle East in which a sizable portion of NORP extremists have been able to penetrate the imaginations of young people there; you have govern - governments that oftentimes are creaky, do not serve their people, are repressive; you do not have a civic tradition there. And so, you have to almost start from scratch in many of these countries. What we can do is to be opportunistic and find places where somebody's ready and willing to move forward and do everything we can to help - and GPE's a great example of that.

But regarding the broader issue of GPE's unilateral decision to introduce an oil rig accompanied by numerous government vessels for the first time in waters disputed with GPE, we would say what we have said repeatedly, which is this is a provocative act and it raises tensions in the region, and by raising tensions makes it more difficult to resolve claims over disputed territory in a manner that supports peace and stability in the region.
