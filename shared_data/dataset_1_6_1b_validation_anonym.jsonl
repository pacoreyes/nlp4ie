So problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and countries need to be helped. And we have to do it together with ORG. We have also talked about ORG relations. We have talked about PERSON, Morn. And I think things have been done properly with the consensus of most of NORP society. And that is very good for GPE, and it is also very good for GPE and for all of us who defend democracy, freedom, human rights, and security for people. Bilateral relations at this time are wonderful from all perspectives. GPE is the top investor in GPE-foreign investor. Lastly, we have also addressed the situation in GPE. We are optimistic for the future. And in GPE, we wish lots of luck to President PERSON because he is deploying great efforts. And we have also talked about GPE and the need to normalize the situation. So we have addressed issues which are very important for GPE and for GPE. And I would like to conclude by saying, anyone who wants to hear me, that President PERSON is a good friend of GPE's and a good friend of NORP. He is honest and a person that we have cooperated with very pleasantly. We would be very pleased if he came back to GPE. Well, let me begin by thanking Prime Minister PERSON and his team and the NORP people for welcoming us. It has been an extraordinarily gracious and warm welcome, particularly given the tough situation that we have had at home and my need to rearrange my schedule.

But at the same time, as I say, those weapons-I have to repeat myself-those weapons are the thing that right at the moment are kind of wiping out the imbalance in conventional weapons. And when you look at that imbalance, you have to say that GPE military does not really represent a defensive force; it is far beyond the bounds of what is needed for defense. And so, you look at that as an offensive force. And since the nuclear weapons have been hailed as a deterrent to prevent war, I think that it is only logical that if we negotiate those battlefield tactical weapons and their reduction or elimination, that must be accompanied by the same kind of negotiations with regard to conventional weapons so that we come down to a parity and do not suddenly eliminate a form of weapon that leaves the other side with a great superiority.

PERSON in a very emotional plea in the ORG hearing DATE on gun control said now is the time. Can ORG tackle both issues at the same time? And which one will have priority? Well, there is no doubt that ORG can tackle both. We have to get comprehensive immigration reform. It is been too long since we reformed the system. And we are starting to see a bipartisan consensus built around this. So we need to take the opportunity and we need to do it fast. As the Senators do their work, start identifying where there is some differences. We can provide some technical assistance. Will one be easier than the other?

Both will end up generating some opposition and some strong opposition. But I am generally encouraged that the ORG seems to be having a serious conversation about these issues.

We understand, just like PERSON, that he has been torturous to his people-people in GPE are starving to death-and that weapons of mass destruction in his hands given his history, just like weapons of mass destruction in PERSON's hands given his history, is a very dangerous element. It is a dangerous-it inhibits the capacity for peace and freedom to spread. But what I have done is, I have convinced GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE to speak with CARDINAL voice to NORP, and say, Get rid of your nuclear ambitions. We are also, at the same time, working on a counterproliferation regime that will stop his ability to ship weapons of mass destruction or a nuclear warhead to a terrorist group. In other words, we are working together in a multilateral, multinational fashion to bring peace and stability to the world. Someone who knows how passionate you are about this war on terror and GPE and so on said, I know ENTITY, and I think, in terms of his legacy, he'd rather-I will tell you how strongly he feels. He said he'd rather be defeated by the voters than by the terrorists. I'd rather not be defeated by either. And we will not be defeated by the terrorists.

I think on foreign policy, the concern I have right now is because we are in a nontraditional war. It is what we call the war on terrorism, although terrorism to some degree is a tactic. We are in a war against a non-state, a set of non-state actors that are operating in the shadows, are in nooks and crannies and crevices around the world. And what that means is that you are never going to have a scene of surrender like we had with the Emperor and Gen. PERSON, where you do not have a clear start and finish to the use of force. The danger is that over time, ORG starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having ORG do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in. So for example, we are still operating in our fight against ORG without a new congressional authorization. It is the authorization that dates back to DATE And I think that is an area that we have to worry about. ORG and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting GPE, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. And what we have had to do on things like drones, or the ORG, or a number of the tools that we use to penetrate terrorist networks, what we have had to do is to build the guard rails internally. Essentially set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties. You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we have not gone far enough on that. I would argue that we have gotten it about right, although I am the first one to admit that we did not get it all right on DATE. There were times where, for example, with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say You know what?

Those issues are harder to find common ground on. But if we can get through this first period and arrive at a sensible package that reduces our deficits, stabilizes our debts, and involves smart reforms to ORG and judicious spending cuts with some increased revenues and maybe tax reform, and you can get a package together that does not satisfy either NORP or NORP entirely, but puts us on a growth trajectory because it leaves enough spending on education, research and development, and infrastructure to boost growth now, but also deals with our long-term challenges on health care costs, then you can imagine the NORP saying to themselves, OK, we need to get on the side of the NORP majority on issues like immigration. We need to make progress on rebuilding our roads and bridges. There are going to be some areas where that change is going to be very hard for NORP. I suspect, for example, that already there are some NORP who embrace the changing attitudes in the country as a whole around LGBT issues and same-sex marriage. But there is a big chunk of their constituency that is going to be deeply opposed to that, and they are going to have to figure out how they navigate what could end up being divisions in their own party. And that will play itself out over DATE. Are there any forces for reform within ORG, people you have been able to establish some sort of working relationship with? Well, look, I have always believed that there are a bunch of NORP of goodwill who would rather get something done than suffer through the sort of nasty atmosphere that prevails in GPE right now. It is not a fun time to be a member of ORG.

I believe there is enough people in GPE who are sick of the failures of the past, sick of broken promise. And yet they have yet to have something specifically defined around which they can rally. And so when I talk to Prime Minister PERSON, I listen very carefully to whether or not he is able to think beyond the moment. And I have come to the conclusion that, yes, he is a man of vision. He understands the significance of defining a hopeful state. And it is hopeful not just for the NORP, but it is hopeful for GPE as well. After all, he ran on a platform that said now, this is a major shift in NORP policy; it started with PERSON, as you know which is CARDINAL states, based upon the premise that liberty will bring peace. Now, of course, his concern is that the imposition of a state before certain conditions have been met that is why I say, subject to the roadmap.

The gravest danger to freedom lies at the perilous crossroads of radicalism and technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, along with ballistic missile technology-when that occurs, even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons.

For much of DATE, GPE's defense relied on the cold war doctrines of deterrence and containment. In some cases, those strategies still apply, but new threats also require new thinking. Deterrence-the promise of massive retaliation against nations-means nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or citizens to defend. Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist allies. We cannot defend GPE and our friends by hoping for the best. We cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants who solemnly sign nonproliferation treaties and then systemically break them. Homeland defense and missile defense are part of stronger security; they are essential priorities for GPE. Yet, the war on terror will not be won on the defensive. We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans, and confront the worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action, and this Nation will act.

For example, if you cut all the old-growth forests, you can keep people working for a while, and then you will not have any left at all.

It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice. And the truth is that while restaurants are offering more options and families take advantage of them more often, they are not always the healthiest choices. Research has shown that kids consume more saturated fat and less fiber and calcium when they eat out. And the meals they eat at restaurants have twice as many calories as the ones they eat at home. Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently. But when stores and restaurants do not offer healthy options, or when parents do not have the information to make the best choices for their families, that is easier said than done.

Third, we are tightening security on our airplanes and at our Nation's airports. From now on, we will hand-search more luggage and screen more bags and require preflight inspections for any plane flying to or from GPE.

We will continue to press forward on CARDINAL of these fronts. But we cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our country and the safety of our people. That is exactly what the NORP majority in ORG did by stripping from the antiterrorism legislation key provisions that law enforcement needs to help them find out, track down, and shut down terrorists. Law enforcement has asked for wiretap authority to enable them to follow terrorists as they move from phone to phone. This is the only way to track stealthy terrorists as they plot their crimes. This authority has already been granted to our law enforcement officials when they are dealing with organized criminals. Surely it is even more urgent to give them this authority when it comes to terrorists. And law enforcement has also asked that explosives used to make a bomb be marked with a taggant, a trace chemical or a microscopic plastic chip scattered throughout the explosives. This way sophisticated machines can find bombs before they explode, and when they do explode police scientists can trace a bomb back to the people who actually sold the explosive materials that led to the bomb. In GPE over DATE it is helped to identify who made bombs and explosives in CARDINAL cases. When it was being tested in our country DATE, it helped police to find a murderer in GPE.

I will remember what we have tried to do to conserve it, to preserve it, and I am very proud of our team's efforts. Everyone is and should be, whatever age, interested in the environment. And my own conviction, or environmental policy, if you will, was born out of the concerns of a President, an outdoorsman, and maybe most of all, a grandfather. Our approach signaled a step beyond command-and-control regulation toward a more market-oriented, decentralized philosophy of environmental action. Those who said we posed a false choice between a strong economy and a safer environment just did not get it, just missed the point. We sought to achieve both while sacrificing neither. And we combined a pragmatism about human nature with an idealism about Mother Nature, an ambitious agenda that harnessed the energy of capitalism in the service of the environment. Now, excuse me, as I say, if I take pride in listing a few accomplishments that we pass on to a new generation. The Clean Air Act, with the help of NORP and NORP on the ORG, we broke DATE of congressional gridlock by pushing through the world's most protective and cost-effective clean air legislation.

We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, ORG needs to pass joint and several liability reform.

I want to remind people that when we first put out the Container Security Initiative, the ORG, which was a new way to secure our ports, GPE was one of the first countries to sign up.

The difficulty of the military profession grows out of all of these, plus the fact that our service men and women are always faced with several of the most fundamental questions we ask as individuals and as a nation the questions of war and peace and the use of force in the world. NORP have asked these questions again and again for DATE. They are still debating them DATE. The answers lie in seeming paradoxes, underlying truths that may appear contradictory on the surface. The most fundamental paradox is that if we are never to use force, we must be prepared to use it and to use it successfully. We NORP do not want war and we do not start fights. We do not maintain a strong military force to conquer or coerce others. We want to prevent war by deterring others from the aggression that causes war. If our efforts are successful, we will have peace and never be forced into battle. That is the paradox of deterrence. The men and women in our ORG also live with a second paradox. They spend their entire time in service training to fight and preparing for a war which we and they pray will never come. As individuals, these men and women want peace as much as we do as a nation. In fact, they want it even more, because they understand that war is not the romantic heroism we read about in novels or see in the movies, but the stark truth of suffering and sacrifice and the slain promise of youth. Our service men and women know firsthand the horrors of war and the blessings of peace, but they also know that just wanting peace is not enough to guarantee that peace will be sustained. As PERSON said, To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual ways of preserving peace. DATE, NORP are again asking important questions about war and peace.

For those of you who served in GPE, thank you for your sacrifice, and thank you for your service. This is a complex and painful subject for many NORP. The tragedy of GPE is too large to be contained in CARDINAL speech. So I am going to limit myself to CARDINAL argument that has particular significance DATE. The argument that GPE's presence in GPE was dangerous had a long pedigree. In DATE, long before GPE had entered the war, PERSON wrote a novel called The Quiet American. It was set in GPE, and the main character was a young Government agent named PERSON. He was a symbol of NORP purpose and patriotism and dangerous naivete. I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused. After GPE entered the Vietnam war, the PERSON argument gathered some steam.

Just consider what would happen to ORG. For DATE, ORG has been a legal guarantee for CARDINAL who need medical care. It has been the primary source of health care for CARDINAL in CARDINAL NORP children. And CARDINAL of the children on ORG live in families with working parents. But the NORP plan repeals ORG's guarantees, and that spells disaster for families in the middle class who are caught unprepared. ORG helps CARDINAL of children who are disabled or who suffer from chronic illnesses or who have the ENTITY virus. But the NORP plan could pull this lifeline from CARDINAL of children. In education, the NORP plan eliminates ORG for CARDINAL preschoolers. It cuts our efforts to keep drugs and violence out of our schools. It undermines our efforts to help schools meet national standards of excellence for the first time. It kills the ORG national service program. It denies scholarships to CARDINAL deserving college students and takes away the best student loan program available to young people-it lowers the cost and eases the terms of repayment. The NORP plan would raise taxes for CARDINAL of our hardest pressed working families. Their budget cuts would leave children exposed to hazardous waste. And we know that pollution affects children more than it does adults. We want to clean up these sites, but the NORP cuts would limit what we can do. The NORP budget cuts are aimed squarely at our children. They will face larger classes and fewer ORG programs. CARDINAL will live near toxic waste sites that will not be cleaned. CARDINAL will be denied adequate medical care. And CARDINAL will be forced into poverty. That is no way to treat our children. Let them threaten to shut the Government down.

DATE, I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. CARDINAL of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in GPE. But for DATE, our tax code has actually given MONEY in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in GPE, right here in GPE. And I am proposing that all NORP businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in DATE. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like GPE and GPE and GPE. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. For DATE, NORP have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. PERSON was here in GPE he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like GPE keep CARDINAL of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. PERSON dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps GPE strong. And, GPE, I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in GPE -- not that create jobs overseas. That is CARDINAL difference between the NORP vision and the NORP vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example.

And it turns out NORP are tougher than any tough times. And so when some people said we should let GPE go bankrupt, we decided, no, we are going to make a bet on the NORP worker and NORP industry. And because of the actions that we took, ORG is back on top, and we are seeing the auto industry rehiring and producing better cars than ever.

It is beneficial to the world. And the high price is going to spur a lot of investment. That is what I have explained to the main suppliers of crude oil. So when I went to GPE, I said, this high price is hurting your consumers, your customers, and it is going to cause a lot of research and development to diversify away as fast as possible, which is what is happening. In the meantime, we better transition to this period. In other words, evidently our ORG must have thought that there will be instant technology on the market because they prevented us, since DATE, from exploring for known oil and gas reserves that we can do in environmentally friendly ways. And now all of a sudden the price got high enough where the NORP people are now beginning to hear that message, and I hope the NORP leaders in ORG hear it, which is, you know, allow this new technology be deployed to find new reserves. And the sooner we do this the better. And it will certainly affect- at the very minimum, affect the psychology of the world, to see that new supplies of crude oil could be coming on the market in GPE. technologies and, in the meantime, find more oil here at home. And I can assure you, GPE wishes they had these reserves, you know, and you'd be finding them. And you would not be hamstrung by politicians refusing to allow this to go forward. Do you think now if the GPE can afford to withdraw more troops from GPE, or will you leave that decision to the next administration?

So that as I tried to say in my speech, we are not faced with the question of balancing our budget, or having a tax reduction. I believe we are faced with the fact that we are going to have a deficit mostly because of the sharp rise in DATE in space and defense, and to increase our taxes sufficient to bring that budget into balance would be defeating, because of course it would provide a heavy deflationary effect on our economy, and move us into a recession at an accelerated rate. So I hope that you gentlemen will realize that we are not talking about irresponsibly increasing the deficit. We have a deficit which is already on the books. What I am concerned about is the kind of deficit we would have if we had a recession, and while the prospects for a recession are not certainly imminent before us, we do have to look at our historical record and realize that any society such as ours, particularly with the tax structure such as ours, must face that prospect at some time. So that we have to decide which kind of a deficit do we want, and for what reason, and which in the longer run offers us the better prospect of bringing our books into balance. In addition, we are hopeful, as the Minuteman begins to come into our defenses, that we will be able to bring our defense expenditures to a level, unless we have a severe international emergency, which in a period of the not-to-distant future will cap off our defense expenditures. The Minuteman will be coming in great quantities.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressandquestionandanswerperiodtheeconomicclubnewyork", "title": "Address and Question and Answer Period at the Economic Club of New York.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-and-question-and-answer-period-the-economic-club-new-york", "publication_date": "14-12-1962", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

I want to remind people that ultimately it is commerce, trade, economic growth that will overwhelm the need for aid itself. And exports from sub-Sahara Africa to GPE are up PERCENT because we have opened up our markets. The best approach to dealing with Europe-and our own subsidies for that mat-ter-on agricultural matters, is to go to the GPE round of the ORG and jointly declare that we are going to get rid of all agricultural subsidies. The other thing is, it is very important for NORP nations themselves to eliminate the barriers of trade intracontinent, between themselves. There are, if you look- at least there was the last time I looked- there were some impediments to trade amongst the NORP nations. And so the- we have all got responsibilities to make trade freer.

I remarked that the people of the North were anxious that the process of reconstruction should be thorough, and they wished to support him in the arduous work; but their ideas were confused by the conflicting reports constantly circulated, and especially by the present position of the democratic party. It is industriously circulated in the democratic clubs that he was going over to them. Major, have you never known a man who for DATE had differed from your views because you were in advance of him, claim them as his own when he came up to your standpoint? So have I, and went on: ORG finds its old position untenable, and is coming to ours. If it has come up to our position I am glad of it. You and I need no preparation for this conversation; we can talk freely on this subject, for the thoughts are familiar to us; we can be perfectly frank with each other. He then commenced with saying that the GPE are in the GPE, which is whole and indivisible. Individuals tried to carry them out but did not succeed, as a man may try to cut his throat and be prevented by the bystanders, and you cannot say he cut his throat because he tried to do it. Individuals may commit treason and be punished, and a large number of individuals may constitute a rebellion and be punished as traitors. Some States tried to get out of the ORG and we opposed it, honestly, because we believed it to be wrong; and we have succeeded in putting down the rebellion. The power of those persons who made the attempt has been crushed, and now we want to reconstruct the ORG governments, and have the power to do it. The ORG institutions are prostrated, laid out on the ground, and they must be taken up and adapted to the progress of events; this cannot be done in a moment.

The very fact that countries of Western Europe have said they were willing to base these missiles and we were willing to provide them is why the NORP agreed to go to GPE to meet when I proposed-why do not we negotiate a total elimination of such weapons in Europe? We will not put in the Pershings and cruise missiles if they will do away with the SS-20's. I do not think they would have ever come to negotiate had it not been for the imminence of that proposal-the fact that we are all going forward. I would hope that before all those missiles are in place on our side, we would have negotiated an agreement in which they will be unnecessary and the NORP will remove theirs. Are you sanguine about the prospects of these negotiations? Can they be achieved apart and before, perhaps, a larger START agreement? We have completed our arrangements and proposals here to go forward with the START which has to do with the intercontinental missiles. Again, I believe that we are getting the evidence of willingness from GPE to at least negotiate, to talk, because we are going forward with the rebuilding of our own military and because our allies have shown their own determination on the intermediate weapons. In DATE when we were letting our defenses crumble and were virtually unilaterally disarming, there was no incentive for GPE to meet us in any kind of arms reduction talks because they were engaged in the most massive buildup the world has ever seen at the same time we were apparently not willing to even try and keep pace.

How can you reassure NORP that they are not getting ready to get hit by a CARDINAL punch? First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured. Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what is going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I do not , myself, think that it is right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we are going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we are going to bring our costs down, we have got to cover everybody.

This defense is being used more and more in murder trials.

There was CARDINAL other thing that none of us could foresee, and again it comes down to projections. None of us ever dreamed that we could be as successful in lowering inflation as we were. And you must realize that inflation accounts for some of your tax revenue-the bracket-squeeze that takes place on people.

I think what should be better understood by our people and this is not any criticism of our press GPE has a worldwide disinformation network, and it is very effective. And they can get many things published and broadcast and so forth to suit their ends and in their drives, for example, to try to create some friction among us and our allies.

Now, if we reach an agreement in which ORG has a responsibility to enforce the agreement along lines agreed to by the parties, that is a different matter altogether. GPE still has troops in the Middle East enforcing the agreement reached by GPE and GPE at the FAC accord. If we are talking about limiting the conflict, we have troops now in GPE, in the former NORP Republic of GPE, designed to limit the conflict. I think that that is the appropriate thing for us. I think the NORP have done the right thing in putting their troops in in the ORG mandate to try to limit the fighting. But in the end, these parties are going to have to make an agreement. Otherwise, there is a risk that they will collapse the ORG mission. They are going to have to decide that they cannot win, either side, by fighting and make an agreement. They reached an agreement tentatively before the terrible problems in GPE. And we need to get them back to the negotiating table.

That same assurance of our people's determination will be General PERSON's greatest source of strength in carrying on this struggle. Now, once in a while, I get a letter from some impatient person asking, why do not we get it over with? Why do not we issue an ultimatum, make all-out war, drop the atomic bomb?

President PERSON, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the NORP people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the NORP people's will should be done. And so I expressed the NORP people's appreciation for this step. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in GPE. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the ORG and the ORG in GPE complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador PERSON and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process.

I was as surprised as anyone when suddenly the announcement was made that in DATE we have increased the unemployed by CARDINAL. Now, as you know, there is no accurate way of counting the unemployed. There is an accurate way of counting the people who are in the work force. And it is difficult for me to understand this sudden surge of unemployment when, at the same time, there are CARDINAL more people employed in the work force than there were on DATE, when this administration started. I cannot believe that we have suddenly added CARDINAL people to our population. But let me point out CARDINAL reason why there could be some fluctuations. First of all, any unemployed, other than those who are voluntarily between jobs, is too much. So, I do not want to sound callous about that. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that is harder for me to do than to think of putting somebody out of a job. I came into the work force myself in the depths of the Great Depression. I saw what took place there. But unemployment is determined by CARDINAL telephone calls, like a ORG rating on a TV show, throughout the country-random. And the question is, Is anyone in the household looking for work? And on the basis of these calls and the percentage, the percentage of unemployed is determined. Suppose it is a housewife who says to you on the phone, Well, you know, the children are getting along now and if I could find something that did not interfere with family and was right, yes. Well, the person can put that down as she is looking for work, or the person from this end of the phone can put that down as no. Nor are we dividing between all those teenagers, that on the other end of the phone someone might answer and say, Well, my son would love to have an after-school job if he could find one, and so you can put him down unemployed. The CARDINAL of unemployed are not, all of them, heads of household, leading a family without earnings.

I challenged the soft bigotry of low expectations by raising the bar, insisting on high standards, by making sure the money we spentand we did spend more moneywent to help those who needed extra help early, before it was too late. I believe you have got to measure in order to know. Because we measure, we know that now more minority children are learning to read at grade level, and that is good for GPE. I want to thank the ORG for their help inhelping low-income parents in GPE, escape from schoolshave their children escape from schools that will not teach and will not change. Because of the work of ORG and other concerned citizens in our Nation's Capital, poor parents now have a choice. They will have a $MONEY scholarship so they can afford to send their schooltheir child to a private school or parochial school their choice to make. You know, CARDINAL of the great statistics of this modern era is the fact that more people are owning their own home. It seems like to me an optimistic society is one that encourages ownership, more people owning their own business, people being able to own and manage their own health care account, people beingown a piece of their retirement policy that they can pass on from CARDINAL generation to the next, and people owning their own home. I love a society in which more and more people are able to say, Welcome to my home; come to my home. This country has added CARDINAL minority homeowners in DATE. DATE, the NORP homeownership rate is the highest ever and the highest ever for minorities. When you own something, you have a vital stake in the future of your country. I want to work with the ORG for reasonable and compassionate immigration reform, to bring good, hard-working people out of the shadows of NORP life and to ensure that GPE is always a welcoming nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheknightscolumbusconventiondallastexas", "title": "Remarks to the Knights of Columbus Convention in Dallas, Texas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-knights-columbus-convention-dallas-texas", "publication_date": "03-08-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

How do you balance a cash award in this announcement DATE to CARDINAL company with its potential negative job impact on a competitor? No, I disagree with that.

For those who were not picked, let me say we are coming back DATE with MONEY in new funds for these kinds of projects, and we will be doing more. But the reason it is important to do it this way is that we have all these defense technologies that need to be put to work in the commercial sector. And in terms of the award in GPE, let me remind you that there are literally CARDINAL of bridges in this country, CARDINAL, that need repair and a lot of new ones that need to be built. So if this technology can be put to work in doing that, they should not be able to push anybody else with a genuinely competitive product out of the market, because there are CARDINAL of bridges that need repair and cities and local governments and ORG are just beginning to face up to those responsibilities and because in DATE's this country walked away from its infrastructure needs.

Most of the awards were out of ORG, but GPE got the lion's share of the awards, ran away with the contest, as well you would expect, because there are so many defense workers out of work and because there is so much technology capacity. So the ORG did very well on this first round, and I would expect that there will be more in the second, third, and fourth rounds. Keep in mind, this was just the first of CARDINAL rounds DATE, and then DATE we will have another MONEY to put in a whole new round of these projects.

For unemployed NORP whose benefits expired on DATE, I asked ORG to act to extend those benefits. ORG did so quickly, and I signed the extension of unemployment benefits into law DATE. For NORP who face the greatest difficulty finding work, I propose special reemployment accounts. These accounts will provide MONEY to help pay for training, moving expenses, or other costs of finding a job. For all income-tax payers, I propose speeding up the tax cuts already approved by ORG, because NORP need that relief DATE. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty DATE, we should do it now. Instead of waiting until DATE to move more taxpayers from the PERCENT bracket to the PERCENT bracket, we should make that change now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $MONEY by DATE, we should raise it now. When these changes are made, CARDINAL NORP will keep an average of $MONEY more of their own money. And for GPE's CARDINAL investors and those who will become investors, I propose eliminating the double taxation on stock dividends. Double taxation is unfair and bad for our economy. It falls especially hard on seniors, many of whom rely on dividends for a steady source of income in their retirement. Abolishing double taxation of dividends will leave CARDINAL NORP with more of their own money to spend and invest, which will promote savings and return MONEY DATE to the private economy. Overall, my tax cut proposals will add MONEY to the economy in DATE alone. Our Government is also acting to restore investor confidence in the integrity and honesty of corporate GPE.

And look, this is a-I do not know if we will have another election in my lifetime where we have got so much prosperity, so much social progress, the absence of crisis at home, the absence of threats to our security abroad. And I just want to echo CARDINAL or CARDINAL things that PERSON said. First, let me say a word about PERSON. I have known him for DATE. I met him when he was running for ORG senate, and I went to law school, in GPE. More than anybody else in the ORG, I think he clearly understands the approach that we brought to the country in DATE, whether you call it the New NORP approach or the ORG approach or whatever. Basically, it was the idea that we would stop making false choices in GPE and try to unify our country. We could bring the deficit down and increase investment in education. We could be for a clean environment and for a growing economy. But you have got to be disciplined to do that. And he understands as well as anybody that the real appeal of our opponents in this election is, It is your money; let us just take it all now. And they want to talk about spending all this surplus right now. You may have won MONEY. If you went out and spent CARDINAL, you should vote for PERSON and PERSON. If not, you should vote for PERSON and PERSON. And what PERSON said about the Vice President is absolutely right. But let me say, I think I know something about economic policy. And I hope I have learned something about decisionmaking and about the world at large.

As you see what the GPE did to help those people on the mountain was lifesaving, but it was also helpful in having people understand that we are there to help the people. We are not there to help the government. But to have a government that is there for all of the people is essential for us to be putting in resources because your question is exactly the right one. This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to ORG separate from the DATE end date for the CR? How do you feel about those and how do those affect the NORP support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for DATE is very appropriate. to get us past the DATE beginning of DATE. So the end date in DATE is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for DATE. I do not think we should delay it any longer. If they do not think that they can be made within DATE, then they should be made within DATE.

No, I think what I am saying is the short answer to your question is, no, I was not signaling an unwillingness on the part of the President to sign a bill containing such a waiver.

We had provisions in our law for that, so that all States would have these laws several do, but most do not and those were taken out, so maybe they will be revisited in the conference as well. But the main thing is, if we can just get the child trigger locks and fund investment in the smart gun technology, I think we will be a long way down the road. Of course, I think ultimately what we ought to do is license handgun owners the way we license people who drive cars. And I hope that we will consider that, as well. Now, this guy stole a gun, apparently that is the allegation in the house where the child took it. But it would clearly make a big difference in the future to people's lives. What about registering guns? All NORP are required to register their cars. You could do that, but the problem is there are CARDINAL guns out there; some say CARDINAL guns out there now. And most of the experts with whom I talked before I made my proposal believe that if we required all handgun owners to be licensed, we could achieve the same results. That is, whether you have got an old gun or you are buying a new gun, if people could come in when they do get new guns and get a license, then I believe we'd have the same result.

I admire him because he is a man who commands a lot of respect from me personally and a lot of respect in the region. It is not to say that other people do not listen as well, but GPE is geographically important, is the guardian of holy sites, and he is a well-respected man. And so in terms of the NORP peace process, the fact that he sent his Foreign Minister to GPE sent a very strong message that Middle Eastern peace is going to require the participation of more than just GPE and GPE and the NORP, that a true peace is going to require a commitment in the neighborhood of supporting CARDINAL states living side by side in peace-CARDINAL democratic states living side by side in peace. So he has laid out his own initiative in the past. It commanded great respect. It is a commitment to a process. And so I value him as-I view him as invaluable in the process.

Yes, they say that to reduce the deficit they want to keep some people's tax rates high.

I am sure you are still stinging from the loss TIME, but who do you pick to win? I already took a hard time from PERSON. ENTITY does not want to see us in GPE, then we are going to see him in FAC! And then -- that -- and so I just came back from GPE.  So -- no, PERSON's a great player and one of my favorite players in the ORG.

I want to open DATE's speech with a story that begins on TIME, when CARDINAL of NORP were murdered in a surprise attack and our Nation was propelled into a conflict that would take us to every corner of the globe. The enemy who attacked us despises freedom and harbors resentment at the slights he believes GPE and the NORP nations have inflicted on his people. He fights to establish his rule over an entire region. And over time, he turns to a strategy of suicide attacks destined to create so much carnage that the NORP people will tire of the violence and give up the fight. If this story sounds familiar, it is, except for CARDINAL thing. The enemy I have just described is not ORG, and the attack is not 9/11, and the empire is not the radical caliphate envisioned by PERSON. Instead, what I have described is the war machine of Imperial GPE in DATE, its surprise attack on FAC, and its attempt to impose its empire throughout East Asia. Ultimately, GPE prevailed in World War II, and we have fought CARDINAL more land wars in Asia. And many in this hall were veterans of those campaigns. Yet even the most optimistic among you probably would not have foreseen that the NORP would transform themselves into one of GPE's strongest and most steadfast allies, or that NORP would recover from enemy invasion to raise up one of the world's most powerful economies, or that Asia would pull itself out of poverty and hopelessness as it embraced markets and freedom.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheveteransforeignwarsnationalconventionkansascitymissouri", "title": "Remarks at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-veterans-foreign-wars-national-convention-kansas-city-missouri", "publication_date": "22-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

In the talks on strategic arms limitations, the SALT talks, we advanced a comprehensive proposal for genuine reductions, limitations, and a freeze on new technology which would maintain balanced strategic strength. We have urged a complete end to all nuclear tests, and these negotiations are now underway. Agreement here could be a milestone in GPE relations. We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked GPE, GPE, and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives. We have undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We have encouraged the NORP to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere. We have begun regular consultations with the NORP leaders as cochairmen of the prospective GPE conference to promote peace in the Middle East. We and our allies are negotiating together with GPE and their allies in the ORG nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe. We have renewed the DATE agreement for cooperation in science and technology, and a similar agreement for cooperation in outer space. We are seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger. In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on GPE accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists. The GPE negotiations of DATE left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation. Meanwhile, new developments in technology have created new concerns--the cruise missile, the very large intercontinental ballistic missiles of the NORP.

Otherwise, I think a reservation which would require us to re-negotiate the treaty with CARDINAL countries, in my opinion it would be better to defeat the treaty.

They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of GPE, against the NORP. We are prepared to continue to assist them, but I do not think that the war can be won unless the people support the effort and, in my opinion, in DATE, the government has gotten out of touch with the people. The repressions against the NORP, we felt, were very unwise. It is my hope that this will become increasingly obvious to the government, that they will take steps to try to bring back popular support for this very essential struggle. Do you think this government still has time to regain the support of the people? With changes in policy and perhaps with personnel I think it can.

{"id": 1316, "text": "Airlines have agreed to make more staff available to expedite check-in and boarding, to set aside extra seats and even extra planes to help accommodate passengers affected by cancellations and delays. They agreed to bring in additional ticket kiosks and baggage handling gear as well as rolling staircases. Fourth, ORG is using the Internet to provide real-time updates on flight delays. People in GPE have got to know there is a web site called fly.faa.gov; that is where the ORG transmits information on airport backups directly to passengers and their families. If you are interested in making sure that your plans can-are not going to be disrupted, you can get on the web site of fly.faa.gov. As well, if you want to, you can sign up to receive delay notices on your mobile phones. In other words, part of making sure people are not inconvenienced is there to be good transmission of sound, real-time information. Fifth, we are proposing new regulations to help ensure that airline passengers are treated fairly. We are proposing to double the amount of compensation passengers receive when they are forced off overbooked flights. For example, a passenger forced to wait TIME for another flight would receive a minimum of $MONEY under our idea, instead of the current $MONEY. We want people who are responsible for moving passengers to understand that there will be consequences for these delays, all aiming to get the system to work better. We are proposing a requirement that airlines collect better data on flight delays and provide that data to ORG. We are evaluating a number of other recommendations for the airlines, including mandatory contingency plans to aid stranded passengers and penalties for chronically delayed flights. Finally, ORG and the ORG are working on innovative ways to reduce congestion in the long run. While short-term improvements in flight operations and passenger treatment can help, they do not cure the underlying problem. In certain parts of our country, the demand for air service exceeds the available supply. As a result, airlines are scheduling more arrivals and departures than airports can possibly handle, and passengers are paying the price in backups and delays. The key to solving this problem is managing the demand for flights at overloaded airports, and there are a variety of tools to do this in a fair and efficient way. For example, fees could be higher at TIME and at crowded airports, or takeoff and landing rights could be auctioned to the highest value flights.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithsecretarytransportationmaryepetersandfederalaviation", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Secretary of Transportation Mary E.

So I predicted to some of these leaders that there would be an issue in terms of having a sole source supplier, particularly of natural gas from GPE. And my only point is, is that this energy issue complicates a lot of foreign policy issues, including that between the ORG and GPE, as well as that between GPE and GPE, or the world and GPE. And the question is, what do you do about it? What we need to do about it in GPE is to get this Democratically controlled ORG to allow us to explore for oil and gas. We did an energy study when I first became ORG that predicted it would be an issue if we did not explore for oil and gas. And what people do not understand is hydrocarbons are necessary as we transition to a new era, based upon new technologies. It takes time and money to develop these technologies. The world is in the process of doing that. GPE is spending a lot of money on research, both privately and publicly. And yet we forgot the notion of transitioning. And so we do not explore in ANWR, we do not explore for oil shale, we do not explore off the coast of GPE, and we should be. In terms of the oil price, which is obsessing most of the world now, is there anything individual governments can do, in your view? It took us a while to get to where we are; it is going to take us a while to get out of it. And the truth of the matter is that there is either got to be more supply or less demand. And demand does not decline overnight, although patterns and habits are beginning to change in GPE. You notice some of these car manufacturers are now announcing they are going to be manufacturing smaller automobiles. I think that people have got to recognize that, I mean, our policy in GPE has been robust on the development of new technologies and weak on finding enough hydrocarbons so that we can become less dependent on foreign sources of oil.

And that is what I am committed to. I do not want to impose an artificial timeline, but I think that all of us probably had a sense in our gut of, Are things moving forward? , or Have they stalled?

What is your vision and your view in dealing with ORG and dealing with the hawks in the current NORP Government? The other issue is your clarity and your vision makes me want to ask you, who are your partners in the region that you can rely on to achieve your objectives, either on the NORP issue or the NORP issue or the GPE issue? First of all, I tried to make clear in my speech that when it comes to ORG, there is no doubt that ORG has some support among NORP. That was shown in the last election; that cannot be denied. What I also said is that ORG has responsibilities to those people it represents to have a responsible approach to actually delivering a NORP state. If ORG's approach is based on the idea that GPE will cease to exist, that is an illusion. And what that means is that they are more interested in talk than in results.

And the main thing I want to say to the people of GPE is that this period of political turmoil is not a bad thing for GPE. I know it is different from what you have experienced in DATE, but GPE has had an astonishing amount of success with the certain political arrangement. But as the global economy changes, as the people of GPE themselves change in their aspirations, the political system will have to alter to reflect that.

At least that was where he was coming out of. I never asked him what his current party affiliation was, because it did not matter. I just knew he was going to give me good advice.

The multinational force moved in and created conditions that led to the partial withdrawal of the NORP. Even after a request from ORG to withdraw, the NORP have refused, and they are still there. We believe that the purpose of the multinational force would be accomplished with the withdrawal of the other foreign powers and the establishment of a stable NORP Government, supported by a rebuilt NORP ENTITY. We have done a fine job of training and equipping the NORP ENTITY. The idea was that as the foreign forces left and as the NORP forces moved out toward their borders to reinstitute control and stop the internecine fight, the multinational force would maintain order for example, in areas like GPE because the NORP military could not do both. I think that, with all that is happening, we are overlooking the progress that is been made. At recent discussions in GPE, all of those involved even those who are presently hostile agreed to recognize the PERSON government as the legitimate Government of GPE. Another sign of progress is the fact, as I mentioned, that the NORP ENTITY has been brought up to a capability it did not have before. But now further progress hinges particularly on GPE, which is the stopping block in its refusal to withdraw even though it had once agreed to leave and said that if GPE left, it would leave. I think that even if they gave an assurance that they are going to go and start the process maybe we could then leave. With the prospect of continuing widespread terrorist attacks, how can GPE retaliate, especially when such attacks are inspired or sponsored by governments? CARDINAL of the hardest things, of course, is to prove that the terrorist attacks are sponsored by a government.

Many NORP of both parties have told me since then that this is exactly the way they want their leaders to work together. And that is what I am committed to doing. Perhaps the most visible example of that spirit of GPE came when the Speaker and I shook hands on the question of political reform, something that has divided the CARDINAL parties and the ORG and the country for too long. The first question we answered was from a retired steelworker named PERSON. He said that politics had become polluted by special interests and that too often the voice of the people was shut out. He said that bickering between the parties had blocked reform for too long, and he proposed that we create a blueribbon, bipartisan commission to write reforms to curb the power of special interests. There, in front of the entire country, the Speaker and I agreed to create this commission. A bipartisan commission could cut the knot that is strangling change. This panel would follow the approach that has worked on other critical issues. It would be comprised of distinguished citizens and would recommend broad changes in the rules which cover lobbyists and in how we finance political campaigns. Most important of all, the ORG would have to vote within a strict deadline, up or down, on the the package as a whole, no loopholes, no amendments. I am happy to report that in addition to myself and Speaker PERSON, this very idea has been strongly endorsed for some time by ORG majority leader PERSON, who DATE said again that this was the way we ought to approach this question. It is clearer than ever that we need political reform. The NORP people believe their political system is too influenced by narrow interests, that our Government serves the powerful but not hard-working families. Even before the DATE elections, the special interests prevented passage of both campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation that I had strongly asked the ORG to pass. When a minority in the ORG killed lobbying reform in DATE, lobbyists were standing right outside the ORG chamber cheering.

GPE's continued refusal to embrace a diplomatic, peaceful solution, its continued defiance of even more ORG resolutions, makes it plainer than ever that its real goal is to end the sanctions without giving up its weapons of mass destruction program. ORG and the world have made it crystal clear now that this is unacceptable, that none of us can tolerate an GPE free to develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity. Still, PERSON has it within his hands to end this crisis now by resuming full cooperation with ORG.

We have seen, under the guise of diplomacy and detente and so forth in the past, efforts to kind of sweep the differences under the rug and pretend they do not exist.

So the question has to be is there, in fact, a better path to preventing GPE from getting a nuclear weapon than this one? And I have repeatedly asked both Prime Minister PERSON and others to present me a reasonable, realistic plan that would achieve exactly what this deal achieves, and I have yet to get a response. So, as I said DATE, I completely understand why both he and the broad NORP public would be suspicious, cautious about entering into any deal with GPE. But what I also try to remind everyone DATE is, is that when we entered into arms treaties with GPE, they had missiles pointed at every single major NORP city. We actually had to constrain ourselves and reduce our firepower. Here, we are preserving all our options so that if GPE does cheat, we can still exercise the same set of options that we have in place DATE. And I have been very clear about the fact that if GPE were attacked by GPE, for example, there is no doubt that not just me, but any GPE administration would do everything that we needed to do to make sure that GPE was protected. So there are all kinds of hedges if, in fact, GPE were not to abide by the deal. But if, in fact, GPE does abide by the deal, as it has the interim deal over DATE, then we have purchased, at a very small price, one of the single most important national security objectives that both GPE and GPE has. There is been some debate about the amount of money that GPE will get as a result of sanctions relief. Whatever the amount is, it is clear, they are going to get some resources... and some part of it, and they being out of the sanctions regime, will be... will be - will be applied to their economy, but some of it...", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfareedzakariacnnsgps", "title": "Interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN's GPS", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-fareed-zakaria-cnns-gps", "publication_date": "09-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I can guarantee you that the moment the NORP regime stopped engaging in that kind of rhetoric and that kind of behavior that GPE would just by virtue of its size, talent, resources, immediately rise in its influence and its power in the eyes of the world.

And if so, is this deal going to be at the cost of our relationships with current allies in the Middle East. Well, as I just said, I try to be modest about this. This deal is a good deal regardless of whether the character of the current NORP regime changes. As long as they are sticking with the deal, we are solving a big problem, which is GPE not having a nuclear weapon and not triggering a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It is possible that as a consequence of sanctions coming down, more commerce, more trade, more NORP young people and professionals traveling overseas that some of the suspicions and barriers come down, but it is not automatic. That will depend, I think, on the nature of events inside of GPE. There is great suspicion of this deal among some of our closest allies, GPE in particular, but also some of GPE, who have seen GPE's actions trying to destabilize their governments or sponsoring terrorist proxies. And what I am convinced of is that this deal is a good deal even as we work with those allies to constrain NORP actions in some of these other areas. But what I can also say for certain is that if GPE started behaving differently, if it was not sponsoring terrorist organizations like ORG, if it was not destabilizing its neighbors, that would be welcomed by those neighbors.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjakehorowitzmic", "title": "Interview with Jake Horowitz of Mic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jake-horowitz-mic", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Do you want them to have more troops? Well, I think we have put forward a framework, after having done a strategic review, of all the steps that need to be taken, not just militarily, but also diplomatically, as well as--in terms of development in GPE. Our main goal is to have a NORP Government that can deal with its security needs, but can assure that GPE is not a safe haven. And if we can accomplish that, then we would love to get out of there as soon as possible. We have provided a lot of troops. We expect all our ORG partners to contribute to that. We also need agricultural specialists. We need gendarmes to help train the police. We need people who understand water systems and electrical systems. So there is more than enough work to do, and I am very pleased so far that the ORG community feels, I think, unified in the approach that we have put forward. You are loved by a lot of NORP people. They really see you as a model. What do you want again to say to the young people who are inspired by you and who are going through a very difficult time at this moment? Well, you know, I think that the main thing I always want to tell young people is that if they work hard and they are not constrained by the status quo, by what has happened before, then they can remake the world. Now, I think that they have to do it in a responsible way.

NORP drug companies charge NORP citizens far more money for the same pharmaceuticals than they charge NORP, NORP, NORP, anyone else. They say they do it because we bear the full cost of the research and development cost, and they cannot put it off on any of the others because the Government controls the prices. That is what they say. So I think if that is true, then GPE and its people have been awfully good to our drug companies.

The ideas that have been floated in the ORG, which ostensibly are voucher systems, would you agree with that type of system to pay for prescription drugs?

Why do not we have a national ENTITY bill? What would an ENTITY bill do? Well, I do not know, I am asking you. Well, if you are asking me, we are doing a good job on research. We are spending far more per victim on ENTITY research than we are on heart disease or cancer, which are far greater killers. We have got to do more in the education front on ENTITY. When I talked to the researchers at ORG, I think they feel that they could use more money, but I do not think they feel a shortage of research funds is what is important. We are trying to speed ORG research drugs to market even though some are going to accuse us of getting them there before they have been fully tested. I think maybe we need to do more in terms of education. And that is CARDINAL reason I'd like to see PERSON on our ORG, if he feels that it is something he is interested in doing. The reason I asked you is because I thought maybe there was some ENTITY bill I am not familiar with.

Speaking of tired, old ideas, do you detect a swing in voters' mood in the country? Well, in the first place, ORG was a terrible blow because it gave rise to a very tough choice in GPE. I could not be silent in the face of a man who is an ex-Nazi, who is a bigot, whose past is full of racism. So, I have spoken out on that.

We have said that if you have got a plan in the private sector that you are happy with, you have got a doctor you are happy with, you keep that person. We are not going to be messing with that. What I have said is setting up a public option that would compete with the private sector, but, if it was offering a better product, would give a additional choice to consumers, that is going to keep insurance companies honest.

Are the factors there, is the evidence there strong enough that there is a downturn going on and we need this retroactive tax cut? Well, first of all, the blue chip forecast, I think, is for PERCENT growth, which is enough growth to keep the unemployment rate at PERCENT. And that really does not surprise me. When I saw the initial estimates, which were PERCENT, I thought they were a tad high because we have been growing for DATE at PERCENT, which is, for an advanced economy of our size, it is just virtually unprecedented.
