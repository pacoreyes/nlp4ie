I believe we are going to get a lot done too. My concern for [GPE] is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. It is easy to say: Well, the competition is too tough; let us just not trade.

I would hope that [DATE] [GPE] still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my [NORP] friend Prime Minister [PERSON], now Prime Minister [PERSON], [PERSON], a good guy. Is not it interesting that the [GPE] President sits at the table with the [NORP] Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Same thing can happen if [GPE] stays engaged and helps societies become free societies. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in [GPE], in many ways. We are allies; [PERSON] and I are very close. I would hope [GPE] would never lose sight of that capacity. And the other question? About [GPE], political-- Oh, the energy, yes. Here is the thing: You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. And, therefore, our strategy is to diversify. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles.

Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in [GPE]. We have got [DATE] of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent [MONEY] on your FutureGen plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has [CARDINAL] emissions.

I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. I do not know if you know this: We are spending [MONEY] on hydrogen technologies.

It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose.

I believe the [GPE] round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. [CARDINAL] is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the [ORG] summit to express their desire to see the [GPE] round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward.

The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. [CARDINAL] classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And [CARDINAL] contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. That is hard work. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many [ORG] nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And it is been a very effective relationship. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort.

He is also got a policy in [GPE] which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, [PERSON]? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his [GPE] policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- He was an opposition member then. Could have been shaking hands. I am going to remind him that, one, the stakes in [GPE] are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-[NORP]-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving [GPE] before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in [GPE] and [GPE]. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the [NORP] have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some [NORP] troops with Prime Minister [PERSON] to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining [GPE] and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. Leaders are problem-solvers. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? Yes. Mr. [PERSON] is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of [GPE], talking about withdrawing our troops from [GPE]. But do you support that they stay, that view? Support what view? That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in [GPE]. . I view both [GPE] and [GPE] as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. [PERSON], of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with [PERSON].

As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-[DATE] he inaugurated a long march participated by [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming [DATE]. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of [PERSON]? And my main question is, do you think [PERSON] is still dangerous? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of [CARDINAL] people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our [ORG] is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of [GPE] rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in [GPE] for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the [GPE] relationship and the war on terror. Yes, sir. The opposition party in [GPE] is threatening to cut the extension of [NORP] participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Yes. What do you-question: Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister [PERSON] in [GPE]?

[GPE] has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, [CARDINAL]-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. [INTERVIEWED], [DATE], [GPE] celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. Headline: [PERSON] Congratulates [GPE]. Do you think that is what it will say? Something like that. Upbeat, optimistic [PERSON]. War on terrorism. Yes, sure. It also marks the 50th relations between the [GPE] and Malaysia-- Yes. So what are your outlook and hopes for [GPE] relations, and especially with [GPE] being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with [GPE]. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister [PERSON], admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. He has remarried. Has he? Good. I will congratulate him. Thanks for giving me that heads-up. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. That is neat. You did, sir. What? You did congratulate him. Exactly. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. I forgot. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. That is right, yes. Sent him a couple flowers. Anyway, [GPE] is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society.

By the way, I am going to meet with the [ORG] leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for [GPE] to stay very much engaged with [ORG]. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of [ORG] as far as [GPE] is concerned.

So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the [ORG] nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about [GPE] is, they are going to be [CARDINAL] of the leaders on alternative fuels. Biofuel. Biofuels-absolutely. And that is another area where we can work together. As you know, I am an alternative fuels person. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the one hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is [CARDINAL] major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be [GPE] that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies.

The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the [NORP] people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to [GPE], and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of [NORP] people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved.

You, President [PERSON], have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the [ORG] site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. What will be the implication of your trip to [GPE], in terms of guaranteeing a perfect democracy for building hope and prosperity? Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of [GPE] have committed to democracy. However, to achieve a perfect democracy is very difficult. In my country, we are a great democracy. We were imperfect. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. [CARDINAL] such problem in [GPE] is malaria.

That is a strong commitment. We have got what is called Millennium Challenge Account programs. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And [GPE] is such a country. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am [INTERVIEWER2] from [GPE].

Now my question is that [GPE] is among [CARDINAL] countries that have benefited from the [GPE] initiative on HIV/AIDS, PEPFAR program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as [GPE] develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has [GPE] made to ensure that developing countries such as [GPE] is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? That is good. First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again.

[DATE] in my speech, I talked about this statistic: Exports to [GPE] from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled . Exports from [GPE] to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. [CARDINAL] way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the [GPE] round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. [GPE] has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the [ORG] and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business . [CARDINAL] way to do that is through [ORG]. And I announced [DATE] [MONEY] [MONEY] of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for [NORP] businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a [CARDINAL]-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, [CARDINAL] textbooks and train [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] teachers and provide scholarships to [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population.

You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your [CARDINAL] mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the [GPE] should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the [GPE] and Africa? That is a very interesting question. A couple of approaches to aid in the past: [CARDINAL] was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. The other approach oftentimes has been: You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is one way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. So we have taken this approach that said we will invest in countries where leadership has made a firm commitment to some basic principles: rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. In other words, there is a criterion to qualify for the money. What is happening, [ INTERVIEWER3], is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. There is nothing more debilitating to a society than corruption. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. There will be no trust in form of-any form of government. And so one of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty.

Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing [NORP] than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked.

So it is in our national security interest, [INTERVIEWER4], that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. I mean, who would want to follow somebody that says: Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of [GPE]. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. [GPE]'s generosity has been prevalent throughout [DATE].

And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in [GPE] chose not to do so. So [GPE] continues to work with the international community to put pressure on the [NORP] Government. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and [NORP] companies. I also did so against [CARDINAL] rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. Some are reluctant to move; some are anxious to help. In terms of the conditions on the ground, [CARDINAL] thing [GPE] has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps.

I wonder, if the countries in this region agree to cooperate, are you going to invite this exercise to include [NORP] military regime or [GPE]? That is an interesting question. I do not know.

Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON ]. There is no real consensus on how to deal with [GPE] in international community. How will [GPE] try to overcome this impasse, most recently seen at [ORG] over [GPE]? Well, what we have got to do is continue to work with countries on [ORG] and explain to them that what matters most in life is the human condition and that individual rights are important. And we just have a lot of work to do to convince people that the status quo in [GPE]-that life can be better, let me put it that way. And it is in their interest that life is better, particularly [GPE]. [GPE] is an important country on [ORG]; they are an important country in the world, obviously, [GPE]'s neighbor. And we-I hope that I can use my good relations with the [NORP] leadership to convince them that the way forward is for there to be more civic participation, more citizen participation in the future of the country, and that the perfect way to do that is to explain to them how backward the Government was when it came to the response for the natural disaster.

Then you have been probably the President who is more committed for the [NORP] democratic movement. But [GPE] tough line against [GPE] sometimes entrenched the generals there, and some people would say that given the example of the Nargis Cyclone relief efforts, then if you have had this kind of relationship with the generals then you could be able to do more. So-- Yes, it is an interesting question. I understand your point. We have been tough, because we believe that the general has been very stubborn in not allowing certain freedoms, and we believe that is wrong. We believe that those arrested in the marches of [DATE] ought to be released from prison. There is [CARDINAL] political prisoners who are being held simply because they had a belief that was contrary to what the general thinks.

But yes, I have been and-because I believe that-as a matter of fact, just signed a bill that is going to continue the sanction regime, particularly when it comes to jade and precious gems. That is an interesting question, had we had a different relationship, [CARDINAL], what would it say to the reformers, but also, would it have changed the number of [DATE] required to let relief in? It is hard for me to tell. What I am concerned about is the general was not being given full information, that he was not fully aware of reality.

First of all, there is a lot of courageous people that have made a decision to work hard on behalf of the rest of their citizens to achieve a free society.

I came away with the impression that they are very grateful to the [NORP] people for the generous support.
