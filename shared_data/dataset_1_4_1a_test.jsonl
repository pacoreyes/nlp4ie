{"id": 413, "text": "Hi, ENTITY, a couple things here. One on vaccines. On the one hand you are telling hospitals to use their lot by the end of the week or face a fine, but on the other hand, you are telling them if they mess up the prioritization, they can also face a fine. Are those competing principles there? And is that in any way, slowing down the vaccination process? And then my second question is about the Finger Lakes and the Mohawk Valley. You are telling them to take extra precautions, but why are not you imposing any additional restrictions in those areas if they are being hit harder than the rest of the state? Yeah. John, just stay with me. I did not hear the second part of the first question. You have one fine for hospitals that do not use up their allotment this week. You have another fine for people who- Week, you have another fine for people who mess up the prioritization or administered to people who are not supposed to be getting the vaccine right now. Are those competing principles? And is that slowing down the vaccination process at all? I got it, I am sorry, I got it. First, the hospitals have been given the vaccines for expeditious administration. If you have been given an allocation and you have only used a third of the allocation, then you should not have the allocation. We have options, John, you have some hospitals that are doing 99% of the allocation. 60% of the allocation. They are much better at administering. I want to get needles in the arms and I want to get that done as quickly as possible. If there are some hospitals that are better at doing that, then they should be doing that. If you cannot do that within seven days, then just raise your hand and say, I cannot do this. Fine, we will go to a different hospital. We know what hospitals are better at administering it. I'd rather have the faster hospitals administering it. The fine, and if you can administer it, if your hospital does not have the capacity, then just say that. But do not say as a hospital, I can administer it, but then do not . That is why you would be fined. You would be fined for accepting an allocation that you cannot administer or will not administer. You should just say, I do not want to participate in the program, which is fine, and then we will give it to a different hospital. The second, Fine, that is not a mistake, John. I want to pass a criminal law to that effect. Criminal law is intent. It is not a mistake. It is not that you were defrauded. It is you engaged knowingly in a criminal act. You sold the vaccines because you could make money. I came to you and I said, Look, I am not eligible, but I want to skip ahead to the line. And I am willing to pay you for that. That is a crime. I am talking about criminal conduct, not a mistake or not that you were defrauded. If a hospital said, Look, they gave me a phony driver's license. And they told me they were 75, but they were not . I was defrauded, fine. I am talking about the opposite. I am talking about an affirmative fraud using this vaccine. You will, mark my words, you are going to see fraud in this vaccine. You are going to see people selling the vaccine. We are already investigating cases of fraud. It is valuable, it is money, and you will see fraud. And before it even starts, I want to say to people, I understand the possibility of this. And I understand this is a valuable commodity. And by the way, it is going to become more valuable when people say, I really want it and I want to get ahead of the line. So that would be criminal. The main spread is now coming from social gatherings. I have said everything that I can say, we have closed and regulated every outlet that we can regulate. Some people mocked me, made a little picture of me looking in the window of a house that I was so intrusive that I was looking into your home to see how many people you had at a social gathering. The CDC has said no more than your immediate household. The state has said no more than 10. I talk about it every time I am here, John, but over about 75% of the spread is coming from people's social activities. And everything short of that, we have regulated. The only place to go over that is a hospital capacity becomes problematic. Then we go to full shut down and that is a red zone. And the Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, you see that number 30% availability. If that infection rate does not come down, you will see the hospital capacity diminishing, and then you will see the region shut down. That number keeps going up at that level, you will see the hospital capacity number come down, you will see the region shutdown. That is what they are looking at. It is math. You can predict the future here because it is just the extrapolation of an equation. You continue at that hospitalization rate. You will reduce the hospital capacity and you will go to a red zone. That is what the Finger Lakes in Mohawk Valley are looking at. Next question, operator. your next question comes from from spectrum news. Morgan, your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. How are you ? : Good morning ENTITY, how are you? Good morning. I was wondering what is the refusal rate right now with the vaccine among healthcare workers and nursing home residents and staff? Do you know how many people have refused right now to take the vaccine? We do not know. I will ask ENTITY and Dr Not doctor, well, he is technically a doctor, he is a lawyer, he is technically doctor, but I do not call him doctor. Because then I would be a doctor too. ENTITY. We know the percent, the successful percent that most hospitals have administered of their allocation. We do not have a definitive breakdown of staff who did not get it versus staff who would not take it. We have anecdotal, we do not have hard numbers, but I would ask ENTITY and Gareth, we will call him ENTITY, ENTITY if he knows anything beyond that. Thank thank you ENTITY. And as the ENTITY mentioned, we have some anecdotal evidence from the hospitals, but primarily with our nursing homes, we were saying we have some more data on that. It is about 10% of the residents and about 15% of the staff. The healthcare workers were pushing very hard and they are also pushing to get everyone vaccinated. That is the critical thing to do for them, but I do not have a specific number for the whole healthcare system unless Gareth does. I have nothing more to add, that is good. Nothing else, ENTITY? Next question, ENTITY. ENTITY, your next question comes from ENTITY from channel nine in Syracuse. ENTITY, your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. Hi ENTITY, how are you? Happy new year. Happy new year, Jeff. How are you doing? Good, thank you, sir. Could you help me understand better, the release from the press office yesterday said the percent of hospital beds available in the central New York region is 20%. Your slide obviously earlier today said that that central New York was at 30.87%. So is there a difference I am not understanding there? Because the 20% has a lot of us concerned that more restrictions are coming. The number you saw today and I asked ENTITY to comment on this, the number you saw today is what that hospital could surge to in seven days. So you have It is a little complicated, but it is a good question. I want to make sure we all understand it. You have, what is your availability today, hospital? What is your surge capacity for staffed beds within seven days? Meaning you could have 20% today. What can you add within seven days and what would your capacity be? What would your capacity be in 14 days? We even asked what could your capacity be in 21 days? So you can have a 100 bed hospital and I can have 80 people in those beds, so I have a 20% capacity, but I also have an ambulatory center and I can close the ambulatory center and I can make those hospital beds, but that would take me seven days. So then I could give you one number for today, but I have capacity to make some changes and add beds. And that is the seven day surge. You give me a little more time as a hospital, I could hire more staff and I'd have a 14 day surge capacity that is a little greater. So you have capacity today, your ability to surge and add, which is either beds or staff, or sometimes both, in seven days, 14 days, 21 days. But Gareth, do you want to comment on that? Yes, the ENTITY is exactly right. The information the hospital gives the state every single day, this number of staff to acute care beds that are currently available. It is a number we watch very, very closely. We have watched the rate of hospital admissions, what the growth rate is, and we can project that out. And then what can you build within seven days? Again, acute care, staffed beds. It is an important metric to be able to know that these hospitals can provide the type of care to a certain number of patients over a period of time. So the ENTITY is exactly right in the way he described it. Okay, ENTITY, next question. Anyone want to add anything? Correct anything? Misstatements, misfacts, miscues, misinterpretation? ENTITY. ENTITY, your next question comes from ENTITY from PBS. Dan, your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. Hey ENTITY, can you hear me? Yes, sir ENTITY happy new year. Happy new year to you as well. So you said something sort of ominous that next Monday will be the start of the state of the state. Can you give us any more details? Are we looking at more than one speech? Will it be done virtually? Just because obviously you do not want to have a super spreader event. What are we looking at for state of the state? ENTITY is super spreader, now that would be a story. ENTITY super spreader state of the state. It should not be ominous, first of all, Dan. It should be intriguing. Look this is a different year and there will be no crowd. So virtual, whatever you call this, but obviously you cannot bring a together. There is no crowd, so you do not have a convention center, you do not have 1,000 people in the convention center, but actually you have many more people paying attention to these types of communications than we ever did before for the state of the state. We have hundreds of thousands of viewers on this, but it will be different. And this is also a different kind of state, not just in the mechanism, but this is going to be a different state of the state because it is a more challenging year for the state and we have more to do so I will leave it at that for now because I want to have a little suspense, not ominous. It is going to be good. I know you love to listen to my speeches and remarks, Dan. So it is going to be very good. Question please, operator. Your next question comes from ENTITY from the Post Standard. ENTITY, your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. How are you ENTITY? Yeah, hi ENTITY, given what you were just saying to John earlier on the zones, how should we think about the micro cluster zones going forward? There has not really been much change over the last couple of weeks, either in terms of taking zones away or shrinking them or adding new ones. I know here in Syracuse, we are hearing from a lot of restaurant owners and other business owners that are affected by the restrictions that are wondering where things are going, when things might be lifted, or whether more restrictions are coming. I guess I am just curious for an update on how we should think about that at the moment. Well, ENTITY, think about it this way. The question one, reduced restrictions. To reduce restrictions, you would have to see a reduced rate. Why would you reduce See a reduced rate. Why would you reduce restrictions when you see the rate increasing? What you are seeing is despite the restrictions, the rate is increasing. Experts will tell you, and I believe, without the restrictions, it would be increasing faster. If the rate continues to increase, you are going to run into a hospital capacity issue. That is a function of math. When you run into a hospital capacity issue, then we have to close down the economy. And ENTITY, Well, we do not want to close down the economy. That is terrible. It is terrible. It is. And yes, that is the last resort, but that is a function of our behavior. You know, the Finger Lakes, you see for weeks the numbers going up. You see the positivity rate go up. You see the hospitalization rate go up. You see the hospital capacity go down. That is going to lead you to a close-down. There is no alternative. So people are in control of their own destiny. This is not government. This is social behavior. New Yorkers brought the COVID rate down. And if New Yorkers are not careful, the COVID rate will go up. And we restricted everything we could. I am not going to reduce any restrictions in a region where it is still going up. And if it keeps going up and social gatherings are 75% of the cause, and they have pictures of me looking in the window and into people's homes, if the rate keeps going up, then you are going to reduce hospital capacity and it is going to be a red zone. ENTITY, let us take one more question. ENTITY, your last question comes from ENTITY from Politico. ENTITY, your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. Hi, ENTITY. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, ENTITY. So just wanted to get a little bit more details on sort of what the issue is right now with the hospitals in reaching the vaccination levels that you would like to see. Has it been the priority issue? Has it been people refusing to get the vaccines, or has it been sort of a supply chain cooling issue? And then how many vaccines have been administered in the state as of today? Okay. About 300,000 vaccines have been administered. I have spoken to dozens of hospitals. I may go to medical school after this experience. It is all of the above ENTITY. There is no one cause, but let us just remember what we are doing here. The federal government set guidance on prioritization of who should receive the first vaccines. We agreed with the federal prioritization on the top priority, what they call priority one, hence top priority. Priority one is inarguable. It is all healthcare workers who come in contact with the public. Why? Because they are most likely to be infected because they are coming in contact with the public, and they are most likely to spread the infection because they come in contact with the public. And I am going to ask ENTITY to comment on this. Look, you are going to have a lot of people who I could argue are top priority. Police are top priority, bus drivers, subway operators, firefighters, right? But healthcare workers on the numbers come into contact with people and are most in a setting where they could get infected. The hospitals get the vaccines. They can store these vaccines, both the Pfizer and the Moderna, and they are responsible for administering. This is to their staff, to their staff. How are some hospitals at 99% and some hospitals at 15%? I have heard nothing besides the urgency and the management capacity and efficiency. They all have the storage capacity. Some are at 99%. Now, while some people will refuse to take it, some healthcare workers will refuse to take it, but that cannot be the issue because they are at 99%. They have healthcare workers who they have not reached yet. So even if you want to say a small percentage of healthcare workers will not take the vaccine, that is not where they are at. Now, it is only been three weeks and you could argue that, well, I am being very aggressive in trying to get the vaccine out the door quickly. I am. I am. I do not want the vaccine in a freezer. I want it in somebody's arm. So yes, I am being aggressive, but if some hospitals can get 99% out, you cannot explain the deviation between 99 and 15. And I have not heard a good explanation that is anything other than within their own bureaucracy and their own administration within their own bureaucracy. Now, they will say to me, It is only been three weeks. And for some hospitals, it depends on your calibration. You could argue that three weeks is a short period of time. I think three weeks is a long period of time. And also, ENTITY, the hospital does not have to participate. If they do not want the pressure of doing it, I understand. Fine. Then just say, I do not want to participate, and then we will send it to another hospital in that area that will participate and can do the employees of that hospital plus their own employees. I do not have any problem with that. I do have a problem with a hospital saying they are going to participate, receiving a scarce vaccine, and not administering it. But I have not heard any explanation other than it is only been three weeks and not everybody comes in every day and people have different shifts. It is all the bureaucracy. It is bureaucracy. But ENTITY, who happens to be a doctor and probably is more sympathetic to the hospitals and the bureaucracy than I am. See, I operate by the doctrine of constructive impatience, ENTITY, constructive impatience. There is always reasons to go slow. There is always reasons why it has not gotten done, especially in government. Constructive impatience is I am impatient, but it is constructive. I am impatient that it has been three weeks and the vaccines have not been administered. I am impatient. Well, that is a negative. No, I think it is constructive impatience. This is a matter of life and death. So yes, I am impatient, but I think it is constructive. ENTITY? Thank you, ENTITY. So I think part of this also is a sense of urgency, as the ENTITY mentioned. The hospitals that are sitting at 99%, there is a sense of urgency within the hospital to move things forward. And having worked in the hospitals, when you feel there is a priority, you push and you move it forward. So those at the top end, obviously there is a sense of urgency there. On the other end of the spectrum, if you look there is the 15%, there is a 32%, 31%. So for example, in the H&H system, the Mayor runs an H&H system, the health and hospitals system. So they have 23,000 eligible employees. 12,000 of them have been vaccinated. They have received 85,000, sorry, 38,000 vaccines. So those other 11,000 employees need to get vaccinated. There needs to be a sense of urgency there. And as the ENTITY mentioned, the issue is that those employees, whether it is in the system, the H&H system, or any of the other hospitals, they are the front-facing healthcare workers. They are sitting right opposite a patient who has a medical condition who, if they get COVID, are more likely to get ill, end up in the hospital, or stay in the hospital and unfortunately, potentially die. So there is this sense of urgency and I urge everyone to recognize that this is a high priority in the hospital system all across the state. And ENTITY, let me just double down on the constructive inpatients. We are doing healthcare workers as the first traunch. First, we want those healthcare workers vaccinated for their safety and the safety of the public. If you are a nurse who was doing COVID testing, nasal swabs, if you are infected, you could come in contact with hundreds of people in one day. They have the greatest probability of being a super spreader. So yes, constructive impatience to protect the healthcare worker and to protect the public who the healthcare worker is dealing with. That is why healthcare workers are the first priority. And constructive impatience because we want to get through the healthcare workers so we can get to the next traunch, which are the police and the bus drivers and the train operators and people with comorbidities and older people who are most vulnerable. We have to get down that list to get to people who are very vulnerable today. So yes, constructive impatience.

{"id": 244, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for talking to the BBC. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much for having me. It is really good to be here. Let us turn straight to your big speech, a hugely important speech you are making in Cairo on Thursday. Many Muslims think they are owed an apology, actually, for the Bush years and the sins that, in their view, were committed by the United States during those years. Is this speech in any way an apology? No, I think what we want to do is open a dialog. And, you know, there are misapprehensions about the West on the part of the Muslim world, and obviously, there are some big misapprehensions about the Muslim world when it comes to those of us in the West. And it is my firm belief that no one speech is going to solve every problem; there are no silver bullets. There are very real policy issues that have to be worked through that are difficult, and, ultimately, it is going to be action and not words that determine the path of progress from here on out. But it did seem to me that this was an opportunity for us to get both sides to listen to each other a little bit more and hopefully learn something about different cultures. You say, both sides, so I take from that that Muslims listening to this speech you are hoping will also be changed by it and their attitude to the United States perhaps change. What needs to change on the behalf of those you are actually speaking to? Well, I mean, look, let us just take one small example: The U.S. Muslim population is more numerous than the populations of many majority-Muslim countries. So you know, we have a huge and thriving Muslim American community. We have Muslim Americans represented or who are serving in Congress. We have got a President who is got family members who are Muslim. So this notion that somehow America is detached, is removed, sees some clash of civilizations as inevitable, I think a lot of the propaganda and dogma that is churned out there is inaccurate. Now, the flip side is, is that in the wake of 9/11--what is also true is that in a whole host of our actions, and sometimes in our words, America has not been as careful to distinguish our very real need to hunt down extremists who would do us harm--something that is necessitated by our self-defense--and broader policy differences or cultural differences that exist that are best approached through diplomacy and conversation and some self-reflection on our part. And so that is the kind of back and forth that I think is going to need to take place. And the last point I made, because I should actually correct myself, when I said both sides, there are actually many sides to this, because one of the misapprehensions about--misperceptions about the Muslim community is that it is somehow monolithic. And, you know, setting aside differences between Shi'a and Sunni, the Muslim country that I lived in when I was a child, Indonesia, obviously, is very different from Pakistan, is very different from Saudi Arabia. And so we have to also recognize that there are going to be differences based on national identity and not just faith. You are making this speech in Cairo. Amnesty International says there are thousands of political prisoners in Egypt. How do you address that issue? Well, look, obviously, in the Middle East, across a wide range of types of governments, there are some human rights issues. I do not think there is any dispute about that. The message I hope to deliver is that democracy, rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, those are not simply principles of the West to be hoisted on these countries, but rather what I believe to be universal principles that they can embrace and affirm as part of their national identity. Now, the danger I think is when the United States or any country thinks that we can simply impose these values on another country with a different history and a different culture. Our job is---- But you can encourage---- Absolutely we can encourage, and I expect we will be encouraging---- But you will. And I think the thing that we can do most importantly is serve as a good role model. And that is why, for example, closing Guantanamo, from my perspective, as difficult as it is, is important, because part of what we want to affirm to the world is that these are values that are important even when it is hard, maybe especially when it is hard, and not just when it is easy. Do you regard President Mubarak as an authoritarian ruler? No, I tend not to use labels for folks. I have not met him; I have spoken to him on the phone. He has been a stalwart ally, in many respects, to the United States. He has sustained peace with Israel, which is a very difficult thing to do in that region, but he has never resorted to unnecessary demagoguing of the issue and has tried to maintain that relationship. So I think he has been a force for stability and good in the region. Obviously, there has been--there have been criticisms of the manner in which politics operates in Egypt, and, as I said before, you know, the United States job is not to lecture but to encourage, to lift up what we consider to be the values that, ultimately, will work not just for our country but for the aspirations of a lot of people. A lot of people are looking for specifics in your speech, and one of the areas they are going to be fascinated by, hanging on your every word, is Israel and the Palestinians and what you say about that. You have made it very clear in recent weeks to the Israeli Government that you want settlement building to be frozen in existing settlements. They have made it equally clear that they are not going to do that. So what happens now? Well, it is still early in the conversation. I have had one meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I think that we have not seen a set of potential gestures from other Arab States or from the Palestinians that might deal with some Israeli concerns. I do believe that if you follow the roadmap approach that has been laid out, if Israel abides by its obligations that includes no settlements, if the Palestinians abide by their obligations to deal with the security situation, to eliminate incitement, if all the surrounding Arab States, working with the Quartet, are able to encourage economic development and political development, then I think that we can actually make some progress. So you know, one of the things that in the 24/7 news cycle is very difficult to encourage is patience, and diplomacy is always a matter of a long, hard slog. It is never a matter of quick results. I will accept that, but you have the Israeli--a senior member of the Israeli cabinet, the Transport Minister saying, I want to say in a crystal-clear manner the current Israeli Government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen. I mean, you have got a job of work, can I at least put it like that? Always have a lot of work, yes. I mean, nobody thought this was going to be easy. If it was easy, it would have been done. But I do think that we are going to be able to get serious negotiations back on track, and we are going to do everything we can because not only is it in the interests of the Palestinian people to have a state, it is in the interests of the Israeli people to stabilize the situation there, and it is in the interests of the United States that we have got two states living side by side in peace and security. What George Bush senior did to concentrate the minds of the then-Israeli Government was freeze loan guarantees to Israel. Is there--I do not want to ask you about specifics, because, obviously, you do not want to say at this stage, but are there potentially sanctions, if I could put it like that, that you could employ, that you would consider employing against Israel if this Israeli Government does not do what you want it to do? I think that I have said my piece on this matter. We are going to continue negotiations. We think that it is early in the process, but we think we can make some progress. What the Israelis say is that they have managed to persuade you at least to concentrate on Iran and to give what is --behind the scenes they are calling a bit of an ultimatum to the Iranians, that by the end of this year there must be some real progress. Well, the only thing I'd correct on that is I do not think the Israelis needed to convince me of that, since I have been talking about it for the last 2 years. What I have said is that it is in the world's interests for Iran to set aside ambitions for a nuclear weapon, but that the best way to accomplish that is through tough, direct diplomacy. Now--and what I was very clear about was that although I do not want to put artificial time tables on that process, we do want to make sure that by the end of this year we have actually seen a serious process move forward, and I think that we can measure whether or not the Iranians are serious. My personal view is that the Islamic state of Iran has the potential to be a extraordinarily powerful and prosperous country. They are more likely to achieve that in the absence of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region, not just responses from Israel, by the way, but potentially other states in the region--and that if what is preventing them from seeing that reality is 30 years of loggerheads between Iran and the United States, then this may be an opportunity for us to open the door and see if they walk through. Now, there is no guarantees that they respond in a constructive way. That is part of what we need to test. A couple of former members of the National Security Council actually suggest that you should go further, though, and that Iran should be regarded in the same way as Japan, that, in other words, nuclear reprocessing should be accepted and monitored by the international community. Is that remotely possible? I think that the key right now is to initiate a process that is meaningful, that is rigorous between not only the United States and Iran bilaterally but also continuing with the P-5-plus-one discussions in a way that is constructive. What I--without going into specifics, what I do believe is that Iran has legitimate energy concerns, legitimate aspirations. On the other hand, the international community has a very real interest in preventing a nuclear arms race in the region. Now, one---- But could Iran have the right to reprocess energy? One point that I want to make is that in my speech in Prague, I talked about how we need to reinvigorate a much broader agenda for nuclear nonproliferation, including the United States and Russia drawing down our stockpiles in very significant ways. To the extent that Iran feels that they are treated differently than everybody else that makes them embattled. To the extent that we are having a broader conversation about how all countries have an interest in containing and reducing over time the nuclear proliferation threat, that I think has to be part and parcel of our broader agenda. You are going on to Europe, to Normandy, scene of a great ally coming together. Have you convinced European leaders, do you think, taking a sort of broad look at Europe as a whole, that it is necessary sometimes to use force to get your way in the world? And I am thinking, obviously, particularly of Afghanistan, but almost in a wider sense, a kind of Venus and Mars issue. Are the Europeans going to be more onboard now to the American way of thinking? Well, look, I think any student of European history understands that the devastation of not just two World Wars but centuries of war across the Continent and across the Channel means that Europeans understand better than anybody the costs of war, and it is legitimate and understandable that they are hesitant. I think the United States has a similar attitude, that we should be thinking in terms of our national defense, not where can we initiate war. We had an attack against the United States that killed 3,000 Americans. There have been multiple terrorist attacks planned, and some successfully executed, against European states. And at some point, we have to make sure that we are eliminating those networks that would--could do our citizens harm. That is our first job as a state, as a Government, and---- And European leaders are onboard for that? And I think that they are onboard on that. Now, there are going to be tactical issues and strategies, and the politics of this can sometimes be difficult. Listen, the idea of U.S. troops in Afghanistan 7 years after 9/11--or 8 years after 9/11 is hardly popular. At some point, we have to make the case that it is necessary, and I think that, you know, what we tried to do with our strategic review was to give a broader framework of not just military but also diplomatic and development initiatives that would move in tandem with the military. And that framework, I think, is one that was heartily embraced by European leaders, by NATO. Now we have just got to execute, and execution is always tough, especially in a world recession where people are looking at their budgets. We are almost out of time, ENTITY. I wanted to finish by asking you just sort of a personal question. We have been through all these issues, and they must weigh on your mind constantly. How do you relax? What do you read? What do you--what does ENTITY do? Well, nothing is better at pulling you out of your world than having a couple of children. So I have got a 10-year-old and a 7-year-old, and they are planning pool parties and talking about homework and trying to figure out how to get the dog back on the leash and---- And family life works in this way. And it really does. I mean, one of the huge benefits of being ENTITY is I now have this nice home office, and I go upstairs and I can have dinner with my family just about every night, and they can travel with me when they are able. And so we have got, I think, a very good deal, and I am grateful that I have got such a wonderful wife and kids. That is my main form of relaxation. Now, the--if I can get in a basketball game, or a round of golf, or I pick up a novel every once in a while, that does not hurt. Are you reading anything at the moment? You know, I am reading a book called Netherland by Joseph O'Neill--almost finished, excellent novel. We will let you get back to it. I am sure you have other things to do before you go. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, ENTITY. Appreciate it.

{"id": 343, "text": "As you have watched what is happening in Congress, do you feel that House Republicans are coming any closer to anything that you could sign? No. If they offered you more, ENTITY, would you be willing then to negotiate things, like a delay in Obamacare in the individual mandate? ENTITY, let us be clear: We are not going to delay the Affordable Care Act. There are millions of Americans right now who do not have health insurance. And they are finally, after decades, going to be in a position where they can get affordable health care just like everybody else. And that means that their families, their kids, themselves, they have got the basic security that you and I enjoy. And the notion that we would even delay them getting that kind of peace of mind, potentially going to a doctor to get treated for illnesses that they currently have simply because the Republicans have decided, ideologically, that they are opposed to the Affordable Care Act is not something that we are going to be discussing. As we talk, ENTITY, we are on a day when, obviously, a shut-down is looming. You said earlier that you were going to be talking to the leaders. Did you mean Republican leaders and if so, which one? Well, I am going to be talking to all of them. And we still have a window; there is still an opportunity during the course of this day to avert a shut down and make sure that we are paying our bills. And if we -- What can you offer? ENTITY, when you say what can I offer, I should not have to offer anything. They are not doing me a favor by paying for things that they have already approved for the government to do. That is part of their basic function of government. That is not doing me a favor. That is doing what the American people sent them here to do, carrying out their responsibilities. I have said consistently that I am always happy to talk to Republicans and Democrats about how we shape a budget that is investing in things like early childhood education, rebuilding our roads and bridges and putting people back to work, growing our economy, making sure that we have got the research and development we need to stay at the cutting edge and that deals with some of our long- term debt issues. But we are not going to accomplish those things if one party to this conversation says that the only way that they come to the table is if they get 100 percent of what they want. And if they do not , they threaten to burn down the house. People who follow this closely, ENTITY, will know that you have negotiated in the past with Speaker Boehner and those negotiations have often fallen apart; that your vice president has negotiated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and sometimes those negotiations have succeeded, but there do not appear to be negotiations going on now. Do you believe there is anyone in Congress in a position of authority you can deal with who could deliver an agreement to you? Well, look. I like Speaker Boehner. I like Mitch McConnell. I think they are, you know, in challenging positions because right now they have been unwilling to say no to the most extreme parts of their caucus. And at the point where they are willing to say no to the most extreme parts of their caucus, I think that there are a whole bunch of Republicans both in the Senate and the House who recognize this is a bad strategy. They have said so publicly. I am in conversations with those senators on a regular basis, and some of those House members, and they recognize that the greatest country on Earth should not be doing business this way. And I think if John Boehner stood up and said, we are going to make sure that the government stays open, we are going to make sure that basic government functions are being carried out, we are going to make sure that America pays its bills on time, like we always have throughout our history, but I am still going to take principled stands on a whole range of issues where I differ with ENTITY. I think the vast majority of American people and the majority of Republicans would say that is the kind of leadership we expect. Would he lose his job? I do not think he would. But it requires some willingness on his part to put the long-term interests of the country ahead of short-term political interests. Ironically, over time, I actually think that would be good politics. Look, I want a successful Republican Party in the sense of one that is interested in governing. There is not going to be a Democratic president here permanently. You know, Congress is going to go back and forth over the next five, 10, 20 years. And what we want is both parties to be able to have principled disagreements, to have very tough fights, but to make sure that the underlying stability of the country is maintained and that we are not demonizing the other side, we are not locking ourselves into ideological positions that we cannot move off of, we are not boxing ourselves in. And unfortunately, that is what we have seen -- that is the pattern that we have seen over the last several years. Let me mention, ENTITY, that one reason this is such an emotional moment is that people on both sides of the debate over the Affordable Care Act seem to believe that once the individual mandate takes effect and people begin receiving subsidies, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, stays forever -- cannot be removed, because there will be political support for it. Do you believe that? Well, I do, but that is a pretty strange argument. Keep in mind -- if you are a Republican -- and we have heard some Republicans make this argument -- some of those who are leading the charge on this make this argument -- and essentially, what they are saying is, once this is fully implemented and millions of people who currently do not have health care have health care at reasonable prices and protections are in place for consumers across the board, that it will be sufficiently successful and popular that people will not want to repeal it. Well, that is a strange argument. So the notion is we have got to stop it before people like it too much. That is not an argument that I think most people buy. Well, part of the argument is sometimes, people come to like things that the government cannot afford anymore. Well, this is -- this is the argument that was made with respect to Social Security; this is the argument that was made to Medicare. It turns out, actually, people liked it, and we could afford it. And unlike the prescription drug plan that was passed by Republicans, which now is very popular with seniors, although at the time that it was passed was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls -- we paid for the Affordable Care Act. It does not add to the deficit. In fact, repealing it would increase the deficit, and so -- If the assumptions in current law held. Well -- but the assumptions so far not only have held, they have actually exceed expectations. Health care costs have gone up slower since we passed the Affordable Care Act. There were great predictions coming from the Republicans that health care costs would go up even faster; that has not happened. There were predictions that the market places that we are setting up -- essentially, the group plans where people buy health insurance -- would not offer a good deal to consumers. And so far, the bids have come in from insurance companies, and lo and behold, they have actually come under the estimates that the government had so far. So the truth is that every prediction about how bad the Affordable Care Act would be for individual consumers out there has not proven to be true. That is ENTITY speaking yesterday at the White House. Now, Medicare -- the program for seniors ENTITY mentioned -- has actually turned out to be hard work to afford. The cost of all health care has been rising for years. And one major question about the Affordable Care Act is whether it will meet its goal of containing those costs over time. Despite the government shutdown, the main parts of the law take effect today. Health exchanges are supposed to open; websites and other locations across the country where people without insurance can shop for private plans. I asked ENTITY if he was prepared for significant glitches as the exchanges open. And he answer was, absolutely. In the first week, first month, first three months, I would suspect that there will be glitches. This is 50 states, a lot of people signing up for something, and there are going to be problems. And I guarantee you, there will be problems because we have got precedent. When Massachusetts, just one state, set this up, it took quite a long time. It took several months before everything was smoothed out. Of course, the same was true with Medicare and Social Security and every other social program that we have set up -- the Children's Health Insurance Program. But what we are confident about is that people will be able to take a look and find out whether this is something that is going to be good for their families. You have talked a lot during your time in office about the widening gap between the rich and everybody else. This is a decades-long trend, but a good part of that trend has now taken part -- taken place on your watch. There was a study I was reading, 2009 to 2012: Overwhelming majority of the increase in income in this country went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Why is that happening on your watch? Well, it is one of my biggest concerns. And part of it has to do with the fact that these long-term trends have accelerated. Globalization, combined with technology, have stripped away a lot of the basic security that middle-income people had because a lot of those middle-income jobs have left. Either they were moved overseas, they were replaced with technology -- whether you are talking about a bank teller, a travel agent, a high-level administrator in a lot of companies, if you go to many manufacturers, it is all roboticized. So some of the -- that is part of the trend. But -- Are your efforts not helping with this? Well, there is no doubt -- The law was passed under a Democratic Congress. Well, no -- there are no doubts that what we have done has helped. So for example, the changes we made in the tax law that increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans while locking in tax cuts for middle-class Americans, that helped. That made the tax system more progressive. The economist Tyler Cowen was on our program the other day. He'd written a book about income inequality. And he argued, based on his analysis, that it is really inevitable, it is going to get worse, and the thing for public officials to do is to adapt to it rather than try to change it. Well, I do not accept that. America is, always been, at its best when everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to succeed. There is no doubt that these trends are powerful and they are global. I mean, we are seeing the same trends in Scandinavian countries that historically were -- prided themselves on great equality. We have seen it magnified in less developed countries and emerging markets. So these are global trends that we are going to have to fight against. But if we are educating a workforce that has the skills they need to compete, if we have a tax system that is fair and not rewarding those who can afford high-priced accountants and lawyers, if we are rebuilding our infrastructure in this country, not only to make us more competitive but because those create jobs that cannot be exported, if we are increasing a minimum wage so that it is reflective of the same purchasing power that existed many years ago, if we are creating more ladders of opportunity for people who are locked in neighborhoods that have been abandoned and small towns where factories have closed, if we do those things, then we can lessen the impact of these broader market forces. But what is true is that globalization and technology are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they create a situation in which consumer goods are cheap and they create a situation in which we can have access to goods and services that we would never have had before. On the other hand, it does create a situation in which a lot of the jobs that are created are at the very top, high-skilled, you know, creative work that cannot be replicated, or at the bottom, low-skilled jobs. What we do not have are those jobs in the middle that we have to really focus on building, because we can outcompete anybody when we have smart policies. Regardless of the budget situation, there is a debt ceiling approaching in a little more than two weeks. You have said you will not negotiate over an extension of the debt ceiling. I just want to make sure that I am clear on that. If there is no agreement, if the debt ceiling is -- the debt limit is reached, if the United States is going into default or at risk of going into default, you absolutely will not negotiate, even in that circumstance? Absolutely, I will not negotiate. And the reason, ENTITY, is because if we establish a pattern whereby one faction of one party controlling one chamber in Congress can threaten default, that the United States of America is no longer meeting its obligations and fulfilling the full faith and credit of the United States unless they get a hundred percent of what they want, then we have established a pattern that fundamentally changes the nature of our government. At that point, any president -- not just me -- any president is subject to that kind of blackmail continuously. If you had a Republican president in here and a Democratic speaker said, we are not going to raise the debt ceiling unless you pass background checks on guns; we are not going to pass the debt ceiling unless you raise the corporate income tax by 30 percent, you know, that Republican president would find him or herself in a similar position. That is not how our Constitution was designed. Raising the debt ceiling is not raising the debt, it is simply saying Congress is authorizing the Treasury to pay for those things that Congress has already approved. So a potential debt-ceiling crisis approaches, even as the president tries to manage ordinary business. He had hoped to name a new Fed chairman by now, giving Congress time to act this year to find a successor to Ben Bernanke. As he pondered that decision, I asked if the president wants the next Fed chair to change course for the Fed. He began by noting that the Fed is a dual mandate, one part is protecting the currency. Part of that mandate is also full employment, making sure that the economy is growing in such a way that people have the chance to succeed. And -- Should the Fed be doing more in that department? Well, I think that the Fed has to constantly monitor where the economy is moving, but we cannot put the entire burden on the Fed. And this brings us back to the original point about potential government shutdowns or potential default because we are not paying our bills. The -- we have dug ourselves out of a deep hole, and the economy now has grown. We have created jobs for 42 consecutive months. We have created 7.5 million new jobs. Manufacturing's come back in ways that many people would not have anticipated. The deficit, which was the main rationale back in 2011 for Republicans to engage in this brinkmanship, has gone down faster than any time since World War II and has been cut by more than half since I came into office. So when you combine that with the fact that we are producing more energy than ever before, that we still have the most creative businesses in the world, the most creative and effective and productive workforce in the world, we have got all the ingredients we need to succeed. What is holding us back are the bad policy decisions that have been forced on the American people by a faction of the Republican Party. And if we can just get out of gridlock and stalemate mode, make some basic decisions, deal with our long-term debts but recognize that we also have to invest in what it takes to grow the middle class right here and right now, then the burden will not be all on the Fed. The Fed will not have to take as many extraordinary measures to make up for the failures of the political system. And now is the time for us to do that because we have -- Has the delay in choosing a new chairman hurt the Fed? No, because I think that Ben Bernanke's done an outstanding job. He is maintained confidence. And whoever I appoint I think will continue many of the smart policy's that Ben Bernanke's made. But Ben Bernanke himself has said that his job would be a whole lot easier and the next Fed chairman's job would be a whole lot easier if Congress started doing what it is supposed to be doing.

{"id": 200, "text": "ENTITY, we have had a request in for an interview for some time, and you have chosen tonight for it. And I must say, on ENTITY behalf and mine, we are terribly pleased you picked tonight, because it was quite a news day here at the White House. You were about as busy as you could have been here. Well, we were talking, ENTITY, and we had a regular schedule of things that in itself was a busy day, and then we had a few little added items that well, I would rather be busy than sitting around not preoccupied, let me put it that way. Well, you were busy enough today, and I would like to begin with that. By the stroke of a pen,ENTITY, this afternoon you issued a proclamation that is going to mean people are going to have to pay more for gas. Can we get into that? How much more are we going to pay for gas? Well, under the proclamation that I signed today, which I hope is an interim administrative action, there will be some additional payments extracted from foreign oil of $1 a barrel, and that in and of itself will probably add 2 cents to 3 cents to a gallon of gasoline. If the Congress acts on the total package, which I hope they will do in a very short period of time, then we will be able to not only collect the necessary funds but we will be able to pay it back. The total cost, when the program gets into complete operation, will probably mean gasoline prices would increase 8 to 10 cents a gallon. Maybe a little more? Well, it is a little hard to tell, but the first increment of $1 that will be imposed on February 1 it will not go on automatically and immediately, because there are stocks that are in supply, and the total impact on the first dollar will not come for about 55 days but that will mean 2 to 3 cents increase in the price of gasoline, and as it goes up to $2, it will go up correspondingly at the filling station. At his news briefing on January 24, 1975, Press Secretary Ron Nessen stated: When ENTITY said 3 cents, he meant that when the full $3 increase in the import fees gets on, it would be 3 cents a gallon. ENTITY, I know that you want to convince the people this plan is the correct one, and yet, today on the White House lawn, a number of Governors from the Northeast were downright angry, threatening legal action. There are people on Capitol Hill on the Democratic side, especially-in the Congress, who think that your idea of a good marriage is roughly the same as Henry VIII's. I wonder if you have not overplayed your hand by taking the action that you did today. A lot of people think it was an arrogant action in an attempt to force Congress to go along with your idea about how to solve the energy package. Well, ENTITY, I think you have to look at it this way and I told the Governors who were down at the West Wing this afternoon that in the last 3 years, we have heard from various Administration officials, Members of Congress, my predecessor as President, that we had a serious energy crisis, and of course, that was accentuated by the oil embargo that was imposed in October of 1973. And despite the recognized fact that we do have a problem, a short-range problem and a long-range problem, nothing has really been done to achieve conservation on the one hand or new supplies on the other. There has been a lot of talk and I am not critical of anybody but it had not materialized into any action, either in the Congress or otherwise. It seemed to me the time for conversation had ended and that we had to act. I said a week or two ago in my State of the Union Message that I was only taking this action as a way to stimulate Congressional action. If I had backed off, there would have been two, I think, adverse impacts. Number one, I think the Congress would have delayed longer in acting. Number two, I think it would have been a sign of weakness around the world that we could not make up our mind, that we could not act decisively, we could not find a remedy. So, even though I have been charged with being a little hardheaded on this, in my judgment, the time for action had come. And I think it will bring action, the right kind of action. ENTITY, your problem involves taking some money from the taxpayers and giving back money to the taxpayers, and it is kind of tricky. As I understand it, you are going to take money from the taxpayers in terms of what they have to pay for energy and some food and plastics and metals and all the things that are related to that. You are going to ask the Congress to give some of that money back through tax cuts. What happens if the Congress does not move? Well, the action that I have taken, ENTITY, is only administrative action up to and through, prospectively, April 1. If the Congress has not acted in roughly 3 months and I certainly hope they will I can, of course, remove the import duty that I have imposed. I have the flexibility it is $1 the first month, $2 the second, and $3 the third. I have the flexibility to retain it at $1 or to leave it at $2. I just hope the Congress understands the need and necessity for new legislative action. I think my proposal of taking money from the economy and giving it back will mean equity in the first place; it will help us conserve energy in the second; and it will provide the wherewithal for us to develop and explore for new sources of energy. Now, this is a well-balanced program. If the Congress can improve on it, I am more than glad to cooperate with them. But the time for action had come, and that is why I took the rather stern action today. ENTITY, you have been quite adamant in your resistance to some of the proposals that have come from Congress. For instance, a number of the leaders, including Mike Mansfield, have talked seriously about gas rationing, and the White House opposition and criticism of gas rationing has been, I think, clear to everyone. You just would not sign it under any conditions. So, where is the give-and-take in the program? Well, ENTITY, I think you bring up the very fundamental question that I had to decide as we worked for about 2 months on what was the best approach, as we saw it. What are we trying to do? That is the main thing, ENTITY. We are trying to conserve energy in the first instance, and we are trying to provide funds for exploration and development of new sources of energy. And we are seeking, basically, to remove our country's vulnerability from foreign oil and energy sources. I was presented with two volumes of options, or alternatives, covering the whole spectrum of conservation and new sources of energy. We took a look at gas rationing. We took a look at the allocation of crude oil and the derivative products. In the case of gas rationing, here is what I found, and I think it is accurate. I found, for example, that it would not be gas rationing for 6 months or a year. This is a 10-year program of conservation. So when we put gas rationing on, it would have to be for a minimum of 5 years and probably 10 years. Well, in World War II, we had gas rationing for 4 or 5 years during a serious crisis, and even then we had black marketeering, we had cheating. And in peacetime, gas rationing for 4 or 5 or 10 years I just do not think would work. In addition, we found this: that everybody thinks that if you have gas rationing they are going to get their full share, and somebody else, or everybody else, is going to cut back. Let me give you this statistic, if I might. There are about 140 million licensed automobile drivers in this country and there is approximately 270 million gallons of gasoline a day, which means that if you divide the number of drivers into the availability of gasoline, it means about a gallon and a half per person per day, or about 9 gallons per week, or 36 gallons per month. And that is a cutback from the average of 50 gallons at the present time, because we have to save that much. Now, how many people can get along on a gallon and a half of gasoline, or 9 gallons a week? That is the way the mathematics works out. So, when you look at the impracticabilities the inequities, in my judgment-gas rationing would not work. ENTITY, you have obviously done your homework on the gas rationing question, but I do not think that anyone in Congress is proposing only gas rationing, but perhaps the combination of gas rationing and other factors. The question still is, if you are willing to change your program and to let Congress go into it, where are you willing to let Congress change it? Well, I think you can find some options, for example, in the most dire necessity of having to put a lid on the actual imports. In other words, if we take in from foreign sources as we are today about 7 million barrels a day of foreign oil, if a conservation program like I have proposed does not work, then I think we might have to move to arbitrary allocations. I think that is a less desirable answer, but it is a possible answer. ENTITY, do you blame people for being skeptical about your plan, given the record of your advisers in the economy and other areas? It was not very long ago that people around here were wearing WIN buttons and talking about 5-percent tax surcharges, for instance. So, can you blame the American public and Congress for being more than a little skeptical that this one will work out just as you say it will? I think there is always room for some difference of opinion, and I must say that I do not contend that my proposal is 100 percent right, because the options that I had to look at there were some honest differences of opinion. But you did indicate that the proposal for the economy that I submitted last October might not have been the right answer. I happen to think in October it was the right answer. But in the interval, between October and January, there were some very, very precipitous actions in the economy that nobody foresaw. We had the economic summit, as you know, ENTITY, and nobody at that summit told us that automobile sales were going to drop off as suddenly as they did in November and December and in January. Nobody who testified or spoke indicated that the unemployment would go up as rapidly as it did. What we have done in the proposals that I submitted on January 15 was to take into consideration the drop-off in automobile sales, the tremendous increase in unemployment, and to tailor our plan or program to meet unemployment, to provide jobs; because in the meantime, inflation had moderated, or the rate of inflation had moderated, so there was a change of economic circumstances, and in reality, I had to be flexible enough to change the emphasis. ENTITY, it seems to me I heard you say a few minutes ago that if the program you started today does not work, that you would go to allocations. Could you expand on that a little bit, how that would work? Would not that require a sizable bureaucracy in itself? No, I think it would be much less bureaucratically a burden than gas rationing. I did not mention in the conversation with ENTITY the number of bureaucrats that I am told it would take for gas 15 to 20 thousand for gas rationing. But you see, when the foreign crude oil or the products of crude oil come in from overseas, it is much easier to handle that than to handle the allocation through rationing at the gas station or through the 30 or 40 thousand post offices. So that allocation would be a possibility, if this does not work? That is correct. Now you told, I think it was Time magazine, that we might have gas rationing if we get another oil embargo. Is that correct? Another oil embargo which would deprive us of anywhere from 6 to 7 million barrels of oil a day would create a very serious crisis. But is that a likelihood, ENTITY ? As I understand it, of those 7 million barrels a day, only about 8 percent come from the Arab countries, or 10, or something like that. I cannot give you that particular statistic. It would depend, of course, on whether the Shah of Iran or Venezuela or some of the other oilproducing countries cooperated. At the time of the October 1973 oil embargo, we did get some black market oil; we got it from some of the noncooperating countries. But in the interval, the OPEC nations have solidified their organization a great deal more than they did before. So, we might have a solid front this time rather than one that was more flexible. In other words, you are worried not about an Arab oil boycott but a boycott by all the oil-producing countries that belong to OPEC? That is correct. Do you regard that as a political - It is a possibility. And in that case, that would produce the necessity for a gas rationing system? It would produce the necessity for more drastic action. I think gas rationing in and of itself would probably be the last resort, just as it was following the 1973 embargo. At that time, as you remember, ENTITY, in order to be prepared, Bill Simon, who was then the energy boss, had printed I do not know how many gas rationing coupons. We have those available now; they are in storage. I think they cost about $10 million to print. But they are available in case we have the kind of a crisis that would be infinitely more serious than even the one of 1973. ENTITY, you have talked also about energy independence, and it is a key to your whole program. As I recall, of the 17 million barrels of oil a day we use in this country, about 7, as you say, come from other countries. Let me just put it to you in a tendentious way. An awful lot of experts are saying that it will be impossible for us by 1985 to be totally free of foreign supplies of energy. Do you really think we can make it? The plan that I have submitted does not contemplate that we will be totally free of foreign oil, but the percentage of reliance we have, or will have, on foreign oil will be far less. At the present time, for example, ENTITY, 37 percent of our crude oil use comes from foreign sources. In contrast to 1960 we were exporting oil. But in the interval between 1960 and the present time, we are now using 37 to 38 percent of foreign oil for our energy uses. Now, if my plan goes through, if the Congress accepts it and we implement it and everything goes well, by 1985, if I recall, instead of 37- or 38-percent dependence on foreign oil, we will be down to about 10 percent. Well, a 10-percent cutoff with all the contingency plans we might have, we can handle without any crisis. ENTITY, may I just follow up on that? You are doing just fine, ENTITY. The other day at your press conference, you were asked about Dr. Kissinger's quote on the possibility of military intervention. And something surprised me, ENTITY. You have been in politics for a long time, and you are as expert a question-ducker as anybody in that trade. Why did not you duck that question? Why did not you just say, Well, that is hypothetical ? You did go into some detail on it. I did. I, in part, reiterated what I had said, I think, at a previous news conference. I wanted it made as clear as I possibly could that this country, in case of economic strangulation and the key word is strangulation we had to be prepared, without specifying what we might do, to take the necessary action for our self-preservation. When you are being strangled, it is a question of either dying or living. And when you use the word strangulation in relationship to the existence of the United States or its non-existence, I think the public has to have a reassurance, our people, that we are not going to permit America to be strangled to death. And so I, in my willingness to be as frank but with moderation I thought I ought to say what I said then. And I have amplified it, I hope, clarified it here. The New Republic this week has a story saying that there are three American divisions being sent to the Middle East, or being prepared for the Middle East. We called the Pentagon and we got a confirmation on that; that one is airmobile, one is airborne, and one is armored. And it is a little unclear as to whether this is a contingency plan, because we do not know where we would put the divisions in the Middle East. Could you shed any light on that? I do not think I ought to talk about any particular military contingency plans, ENTITY. I think what I said concerning strangulation and Dr. Kissinger's comment is about as far as I ought to go. Then we have reached a point where another question would be unproductive on that? I think you are right. ENTITY, you said the other day that speaking of that general area you think there is a serious danger of war in the Middle East; earlier this year, you were quoted as saying something over 70 percent. Has it gone up recently? I do not think I ought to talk in terms of percentage, ENTITY. There is a serious danger of war in the Middle East. I have had conferences with representatives of all the nations, practically, in the Middle East. I have talked to people in Europe. I have talked to other experts, and everybody says it is a very, potentially volatile situation. It is my judgment that we might have a very good opportunity to be successful in what we call our step-by-step process. I hope our optimism is borne out. We are certainly going to try. Is it tied to Secretary Kissinger's next trip to that part of the world? Well, he is going because we think it might be fruitful, but we do not want to raise expectations. We have to be realistic, but if we do not try to move in this direction at this time, I think we might lose a unique opportunity. Should we not succeed this time, ENTITY, do you think it is probably time that we have to abandon this step-by-step process and go on to Geneva as the Soviets would like to have us do? I think that is a distinct possibility. We prefer the process that has been been successful so far, but if there is no progress, then I think we undoubtedly would be forced to go to Geneva. I would not be any more optimistic; in fact, I would be less optimistic if the matter was thrown on the doorstep of Geneva. ENTITY, really, the Russians have been shut out of Middle Eastern diplomacy since Dr. Kissinger began step-by-step diplomacy. Why was that? Could not the Russians play more of a positive role than they are doing? They are arming the Arabs to the teeth, and that is really about all we have been able to see or all they have been allowed to do under the way that we have set our policies. I am not as authoritative on what was done during the October war of 1973 in the Middle East as I am now, of course. I can assure you that we do keep contact with the Soviet Union at the present time. We are not trying to shut them out of the process of trying to find an answer in the Middle East. They can play and they have played a constructive role, even under the current circumstances. So, I think it is unfair and not accurate to say that they are not playing a part. We are taking a course of action where it is more visible perhaps that we are doing something. But I say sincerely that the Soviet Union is playing a part, even at the present time. Would you tell us what you think about the idea that is going around a little bit and perhaps you have heard it as well, perhaps you know a great deal about it, I do not know that if the Israelis made a significant pullback on various fronts in the Middle East, that that could be followed by some sort of American guarantee for their security? ENTITY, I really do not think I ought to get into the details of what might or might not be the grounds for a negotiated settlement. This is a very difficult area because of the long history of jealousies, antagonisms, and it is so delicate I really do not think I ought to get into the details of what might or might not be the grounds for a settlement. Would you entertain a question based on the reported Israeli desire for a threefold increase in our aid to them? The United States, over the years, has been very generous in economic and military aid for Israel. On the other hand, we have been quite generous to a number of Arab nations. The State of Israel does need adequate military capability to protect its boundaries or its territorial integrity. I think because of the commonality of interest that we have with Israel in the Middle East that it is in our interest as well as theirs to be helpful to them, both militarily and economically. There has been no determination by me or by us as to the amount of that aid. ENTITY, I wonder if we can come back at you again about Israel's security in another way. As you know, reporters do not give up easily on some of these questions. I found that out, ENTITY. On a long-range basis, do you think that it is possible for Israel to be truly secure in the Middle East without a United States guarantee of some kind? Well, of course, Israel, to my knowledge, ENTITY, has never asked for any U.S. manpower or any guarantee from us for their security or their territorial integrity. I think the Israelis, if they are given adequate arms and sufficient economic help, can handle the situation in the Middle East. Now, the last war, unfortunately, was much more severe from their point of view than the three previous ones. And I suspect that with the Arabs having more sophisticated weapons and probably a better military capability, another war might even be worse. That is one reason why we wish to accelerate the efforts to find some answers over there. But I think the Israelis, with adequate equipment and their determination and sufficient economic aid, will not have to have U.S. guarantees of any kind. I wonder if we can move to another area in the world, or would you like to go back to the Middle East? I have one question I would like to put to ENTITY. ENTITY, when we talk about strangulation and I hope we do not talk about it any more tonight after this, because I do think it is the hypothetical, I agree with you on that what about the moral implications? If a country is being strangled by another country or set of countries that own a natural resource, is it moral to go and take that? It is their oil; it is not ours. Is not that a troublesome question? I think it is a troublesome question. It may not be right, ENTITY, but I think if you go back over the history of mankind, wars have been fought over natural resources from time immemorial. I would hope that in this decade or in this century and beyond, we would not have to have wars for those purposes, and we certainly are not contemplating any such action. But history, in the years before us, indicates quite clearly that that was one of the reasons why nations fought one another. ENTITY, what are our objectives now in Southeast Asia, in Vietnam, particularly? Vietnam, after all the lives that were lost there, Americans, over 50,000, and after the tremendous expenditures that we made in American dollars several years, more than $30 billion a year it seems to me that we ought to try and give the South Vietnamese the opportunity, through military assistance, to protect their way of life. This is what we have done traditionally as Americans. Certainly since the end of World War II, we have helped innumerable nations in military arms and economic assistance to help themselves to maintain their own freedom. The American people believe, I think, historically, that if a country and a people want to protect their way of life against aggression, we will help them in a humanitarian way and in a military way with arms and funds if they are willing to fight for themselves. This is within our tradition as Americans. And the South Vietnamese apparently do wish to maintain their national integrity and their independence. I think it is in our best tradition as Americans to help them at the present time. How much longer and how deep does our commitment go to the South Vietnamese? I do not think there is any long-term commitment. As a matter of fact, the American Ambassador there, Graham Martin, has told me as well as Dr. Kissinger that he thinks if adequate dollars, which are translated into arms and economic aid, if that was made available, that within 2 or 3 years the South Vietnamese would be over the hump militarily as well as economically. Now, I am sure we have been told that before, but they had made substantial progress until they began to run a little short of ammunition, until inflation started in the last few months to accelerate. I happen to think that Graham Martin, who is a very hard-nosed, dedicated man, and very realistic, is right. And I hope the Congress will go along with this extra supplemental that I am asking for to help the South Vietnamese protect themselves. ENTITY, that is $300 million you have asked for the South Vietnamese. And given what you have just said well, I am just going to phrase it this way will we see the light at the end of the tunnel if we give them $300 million? The best estimates of the experts that are out there, both military and civilian, tell me that $300 million in this fiscal year is the minimum. A year ago when the budget was submitted for military assistance for South Vietnam, it was $1,400 million. Congress cut it in half, which meant that South Vietnamese rangers going out on patrol, instead of having an adequate supply of hand grenades and weapons, were cut in half, which, of course, has undercut their military capability and has made them conserve and not be as strong. Now, $300 million does not take them back up to where they were or where it was proposed they should be. But the experts say, who are on the scene, who have seen the fighting and have looked at the stocks and the reserves, tell me that that would be adequate for the current circumstances. ENTITY, does it make you uneasy to sit on that couch in this room and have experts in Vietnam saying, only a little bit more and it will be all right? We did hear that for so many years. I think you have to think pretty hard about it. But a lot of skeptics, ENTITY, said that the money we were going to make available for the rehabilitation of Europe after World War II would not do any good, and of course, the investment we made did pay off. A lot of people have said the money that we made available to Israel would not be helpful in bringing about the peace that has been achieved there for the last year and a half or so, but it did. It helped. I think an investment of $300 million at this time in South Vietnam could very likely be a key for the preservation of their freedom and might conceivably force the North Vietnamese to stop violating the Paris accords of January 1973. When you look at the agreement that was signed and I happened to be there at the time of the signing in January of 1973 the North Vietnamese agreed not to infiltrate. The facts are they have infiltrated with countless thousands-I think close to 100,000 from North Vietnam down to South Vietnam. They are attacking cities, metropolitan areas. They have refused to permit us to do anything about our U.S. missing in action in North Vietnam. They have refused to negotiate any political settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. They have called off the meetings either in Paris or in Saigon. So, here is a country South Vietnam that is faced with an attitude on the part of the North Vietnamese of total disregard of the agreement that was signed about 2 years ago. I think the South Vietnamese deserve some help in this crisis. ENTITY, underlying all of this in much of this interview is a kind of supposition on your part, I guess, that the American public is willing to carry the burdens that it has carried in the past. Do you believe that? Is that your view of the world, kind of, and the view of this country? Yes, and I am proud of that, ENTITY. The United States we are fortunate. We have a substantial economy. We have good people who by tradition certainly since the end of World War II have assumed a great responsibility. We rehabilitated Europe. We helped Japan both in the case of Germany and Japan, enemies that we defeated. We have helped underdeveloped countries in Latin America, in Africa, in Southeast Asia. I think we should be proud of the fact that we are willing to share our great wealth with others less fortunate than we. And it gives us an opportunity to be a leader setting an example for others. And when you look at it from our own selfish point of view, what we have done has basically helped America, but in addition, it has helped millions and millions of other people. We should be proud of it. We should not be critical of our efforts. ENTITY, I would like to move on, if I could, and ask you, as a reporter, if you would care to share a little information with me on a paper you read recently on the CIA. You read a paper given to you by the CIA. There have been resignations at the CIA. Officials of the CIA have admitted some of the charges that have been made against them. How far did they get off the reservation, ENTITY? I did read the report that was submitted to me by Bill Colby, the head of CIA. And after reading it, I determined that rather than myself making a judgment as to whether they were violating their legislative charter or whether there was any guilt on the part of any individual, the present Director or any of his predecessors, that the proper thing for me to do was to turn the investigation over to a very reputable group of gentlemen who would look into the facts, take testimony, and make a report, number one, as to the charges; number two, make recommendations to me as to any disciplinary action or changes within the present personnel; and to make recommendations as to whether the charter of CIA ought to be revised. I asked the Vice President, Nelson Rockefeller, to head up this group of seven people, three Democrats, three Republicans, men of outstanding experience and, I think, excellent judgment, and they are in the process now. It would be premature for me, ENTITY, to pass judgment on the degree of violation of the charter. There have been admissions that there were some indiscretions or potentially illegal actions. But for me to say on this program that Mr. A did something that was illegal or the group did something totally wrong, I think it is better for me to wait and see what this Commission reports to me. ENTITY, another agency, the FBI, has recently been involved in a controversy about keeping track of Americans as well, keeping files on Members of Congress, among others. Clearing away everything else, do you think that there is any reason for those files to be retained? ENTITY, I think you have to look at what the responsibility is of the FBI. Number one, the FBI under no circumstances should do anything they should not spy on Members of Congress. I do not think they ought to spy on law-abiding American citizens. But there are certain areas where the FBI has a legal responsibility. The FBI has the responsibility to check on individuals who are charged with a crime any American citizen, including a Member of Congress. The FBI, if they are seeking to employ somebody or if somebody applies for a job, the FBI has an obligation to check on that person's record. And some Members of. Congress at the present time served in the FBI at various times prior to being elected to the House or to the Senate. So, the FBI ought to have files on those people. Now, in addition, as I understand it, the FBI in the course of investigating a person gets information concerning somebody else, and that may be information concerning a Member of Congress. I am told that that information that is gotten in a peripheral way does go into a file. That kind of information, in my judgment, ought to be reported to the Member of the House or to the Member of the Senate. But why should it be retained, even? If there is no criminality or evidence of it or they are not interviewing them for a job, why should they even retain it in any fashion? I think that is a good question, ENTITY. I would have no objection to having that kind of information disposed of. As I understand it, ENTITY, the way it works now is that the FBI tells a Member of Congress if they have heard some scurrilous charge against him, he denies it, and they keep both the charge and the denial in his file. I had not heard that, ENTITY, but I think that is kind of silly. You mentioned the charter of the CIA and you mentioned the responsibility of the United States Government to engage in a certain amount of looking at and investigating citizens who are not necessarily charged with a crime, as in job applications and in other things. Do you suppose that we could work out a better way of sharing this responsibility in the American Government? Could that come out of these FBI and CIA investigations? I think you have to differentiate, ENTITY, between the charter of the FBI and the responsibilities of the CIA. There is supposed to be a clear line of demarcation between the two And apparently there was not , at times. and for various reasons, that line was overstepped, and of course, the investigations, I think, will expose what caused it and how we can remedy it. But the FBI has domestic responsibilities, responsibilities within the continental limits of the United States. The CIA is supposed to be an intelligence gathering bureau aimed at overseas operations on this country's behalf. I think the CIA is vitally important to our total national security, both diplomatically as well as militarily. I can assure you that they do, in the areas that I am intimately familiar with, an excellent job of providing the Department of Defense and providing me with information that is important for decisionmaking process on what I think we should do militarily or diplomatically, and they do a fine job on behalf of the Department of Defense. Now, I do not think they ought to get into any domestic surveillance, and mistakes apparently were made going back as early as 1964 or 19,55. It has stopped now. And I have given instructions that under no circumstances shall it be started again, and I think the CIA has probably learned. But I do not think we should destroy the CIA in trying to straighten out the indiscretions or the mistakes that were made. ENTITY, on an unrelated subject I have always wanted to ask you this question about the credibility of American justice as, let us say, young Americans see it. We have just gone through the worst scandals in the history of the Presidency. Mr. Agnew, we are told, is going to become a millionaire at least his business partner says that. Mr. Nixon is in California. Some of these other people who were involved are getting huge book advances. How do you suppose that squares with the idea of justice as young people ought to see it in this country? That is a hard question to answer, ENTITY. I am sure it disturbs a lot of Americans young as well as old Americans who have worked hard all their lives, have made middle-income wages or salaries, lived an honest, decent life, raised a family, and find that for various economic reasons they are in trouble, and they see these stories about some of these people who have pled guilty or been convicted and gone to jail and - And some of the big ones not touched at all. That is correct. And yet, they come out with guarantees or prepayments of substantial amounts. I think it will bother a good many Americans, young as well as old. And I do not have any answer. I would not buy the books, let me add. That is the first non-Presidential plug for a book, I think, that I have ever heard. I have a question, ENTITY, that it just is not easy to phrase, so I will just have to bear straight ahead with it. As you know, I am certain, because I have been told that you have commented on this before, but it has been speculated on in print not only in Washington but elsewhere, and it crops up in conversation from time to time in this town the question of whether or not you are intellectually up to the job of being the President of the United States. When you hear that kind of talk or read that in print, does it bother you? It really does not , ENTITY. And I suppose people wonder why it does not bother me. My answer is as hard as the question that you asked. If grades one gets in school are a criteria and we have been doing it for years and are still doing it whether I was in high school or at the University of Michigan or at Yale Law School, I was always in the upper third or the upper 10 percent of my class. Now, if I do not have the academic capability being in either the upper third at Yale Law School or in the upper 20-some percent at the University of Michigan-there must be an awful lot of people much dumber than I. Now, I do not think that is the only way by which you judge people. I think grades are important, judgment is a pretty important factor, and a capability on the part of a person to work, to analyze problems is equally important. And I think the fact that I have done reasonably well, both in Congress, in first getting there, and number two, in getting to be a leader and retaining that post for five elections among my peers as a Member on our side of the aisle I think that does show some feeling on the part of responsible people that I have the capability of doing the job. ENTITY, I want to just ask you about a personal moment that I witnessed in Vladivostok. After you signed the agreement with General Secretary Brezhnev and there was a shaking of hands, and the champagne, I caught you looking out kind of into the distance for a moment there, and I thought I saw, at least in your eyes, a question of What in the world am I doing here a year after being in the House of Representatives? Do you sometimes find yourself, given the way you came to this office, stopping for a moment and thinking that and wondering as these events brush by you? I cannot recall that particular incident, ENTITY, but to be honest and frank with you, yes, I have thought I never anticipated that I would be in the White House, in this building where this program is originating. I had other political ambitions, and I prepared myself primarily for those objectives. But nevertheless, even though I have wondered how it all happened, I feel very secure in the capability that I have to do the job..And I can assure you that my feeling of security, my feeling of certainty that I can handle it grows every day. But nevertheless, you cannot help but wonder sometimes, how did it all happen. Could I phrase it this way, because I think that the growth on your part, as we in the press have perceived it, has been considerable. For a long while you represented Grand Rapids, Michigan, as you should have, but suddenly, you have been put into another arena, and your Government is about to borrow $28 billion in 6 months $80 billion in the next 18 months. Well, we are dealing with these enormous figures now that do not seem to me to square at all with the ideological and political outlook that you have had for much of your life. Could you talk about that? I think all of us, ENTITY, who work at a job and seek to broaden one's self in the process of step-by-step movement in a career, have to understand the much more complex problems that we face. As I moved from a freshman Congressman in 1949 to a Republican leader in January of 1965, and as I moved from being a new Republican leader in January of '65 to a Republican leader, 8, 9 years later if you have the capability and work at it, you inevitably get a broader look at life. And that gives you, I think, a better understanding, not only of the complexities at home but the enormous difficulties and complexities on a worldwide basis. I would be ashamed of myself if I did not think, from January of 1949, when I first took the oath of office in the House of Representatives, till now, I had not learned a lot, profited by mistakes, analyzed what I had done, right or wrong, and expanded my knowledge and understanding. It has been a great deal of satisfaction to me that I have been able to meet those challenges. And now you are here in the cockpit. I mean, you are really on the spot as President now. Have you learned in your months in this office and in this house do we tend to put Presidents too much on pedestals? Do we expect too much from the human beings who occupy this office? An awful lot is expected, ENTITY. But I think a person who is President of the United States should expect that kind of responsibility, and he should act accordingly. To do otherwise, I think, would be just wrong. I think a person who is President, either elected or, as I was, under the unusual circumstances, has to feel that there is an enormous responsibility and that the American people expect him to perform 150 percent of his capability, both as to mental and time and judgment and everything else. ENTITY, you said in an interview 2 recently that you thought you would have a better grasp of what the Presidency is and what your role is in it in about 6 months. If things do not work out quite the way that you want them to, will it change your mind at all about your own future in this office? ENTITY, I think I said that the public could judge my performance better at the end of 6 months than they could at the present time. It has been about 5 months since I have been President. We have had some tough decisions, both at home and abroad. We are facing a very difficult and very critical period domestically for the next 6 to 12 months. I said that, in the interview, based on the programs that I had submitted for the economy and for energy, I believe we will make some headway. And if we do, it will be discernible within 6 months, maybe not as much as I would like, but at least we will be out of the slump and starting to move upward. And then I think that is a better time for people to judge me than at the present time. ENTITY, if in early 1976 we are at double-digit inflation and unemployment is over 7 percent, would you be a candidate for office again? Those are pretty tough odds, and I think anybody has to be realistic. But I add very quickly, ENTITY, I do not think that is going to happen, because the resiliency of the American economy is such that we are going to rebound from this recession, and I think we will do it more quickly and in a better way than most pessimists say. So, I am not anticipating in 1976 that we are going to have that high unemployment. I think we will have more jobs, people will have a fresher, more optimistic point of view. So, based on that forecast, not the one that you speculated on, I am planning to be a candidate in 1976. On that note, ENTITY, for ENTITY Brokaw and for me, I want to thank you, and for NBC News, for having us here in this house this evening. It was very instructive for us. Thank you, ENTITY, and thank you, ENTITY. We have enjoyed having you here. Thank you, ENTITY.

{"id": 28, "text": "More than half of Americans have lost confidence in your ability to lead the country and get the job done. That may have been stunning to you? Disappointed? I have been dealing with stuff like this since 2009. How do you turn it around? There have been a number of times where, you know, the punditry said gosh, you know, how do you turn it around. And what we do is staying focused on what matters and chip away at it and try to make progress. People have health care. The economy has gotten a lot better. What I do worry about is that right now we have got a Republican Party that seems to only care about saying no to me. You have got Speaker Boehner talking about suing you for executive actions that he says has crossed the line. He says we elected a president; we did not elect a monarch or a king. Well, you notice that he did not specifically say what exactly he was objecting to. I am not going to apologize for trying to do something while they are doing nothing. Even if you get sued? You know, the suit is a stunt. But what I have told Speaker Boehner directly is, if you are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, why do not you try getting something done through Congress. The majority of the American people want to see immigration reform done. We had a bipartisan bill through the Senate, and you are going to squawk if I try to fix some parts of it administratively that are within my authority while you are not doing anything? You mentioned immigration. There is a humanitarian crisis on the border. Some of your critics have said you have to speak out more directly to the people of Central America and say: Do not come; if you come, you will be deported. Actually, we have done that. The problem is is that, under current law, once those kids come across the border, there is a system in which we are supposed to process them, take care of them until we can send them back. Is your message do not come ? Oh, our message absolutely is: Do not send your children unaccompanied on trains or through a bunch of smugglers. That is our direct message to the families in Central America. Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they will get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it. Let us talk about Iraq. How serious is this ISIS threat to people here in Minnesota, around the country? I was so struck by an article that Ryan Crocker, who served as Iraq ambassador under you, wrote last week. He said: Make no mistake. This is global jihad. It is coming our way. They have 2,000 fighters with Western passports that do not need a visa to get in. Are we under serious threat right now from ISIS? You know, I think we have been under serious threat my entire presidency, and we have been under serious threat predating 9/11 from those who embrace this ideology. But they are gaining strength, are not they? Well, they are gaining strength in some places. But we have also got a lot better at protecting ourselves. Let me ask you a final question on foreign policy. It comes from something you wrote back in 2006 in Audacity of Hope. You were talking about President Bush's foreign policy strategy and you said: Without a well-articulated strategy that the public supports and the world understands, America will lack legitimacy and ultimately the power it needs to make the word safer than it is today. The majority of Americans do not support your path on foreign policy. Are you failing by your own standard? ENTITY, I not only go back to the polls, but let me just say that throughout the first half of my presidency, polls consistently showed strong support for my foreign policy and -- But the public has to support it, does not it? But not at every minute, ENTITY. Not every week. Because there are going to be times where the world is messy. One of the things we also realized during the course of five years is that, if the problems were easy, somebody else would have solved them already. And one of the great challenges of this job but one of the great privileges of this job is that, you know, you are tackling stuff that is really tough. And I am glad that, after five years, I am still here able to do it. We really only had a couple of shots at the goal. Yeah. This has been a tough game. And now everyone knows not to bite. We have advanced from a nonfactor to being a solid middle -- we are a middle-of-the-pack team. We are not Germany yet or Italy or France, but -- or Argentina or Brazil. But we are now in the mix. You get a sense that it is captured the popular imagination. I was surprised by how much this has broken through. My little girl -- my nine-year-old came up to me and asked to watch the game Sunday, but she does not seem much into TV, but everybody's talking about it. Yeah. Well, if you think about it, part of it is what is happening with us as parents. Right? You know, even kids who end up being basketball players or whatever, a lot of times their first sport is playing soccer. I will tell you, though, we have to -- there have been elements, which I will not detail, of our foreign policy that have had to be shaped around the World Cup. Get out of here. Phone calls? You know, certain phone calls, certain meetings, initiatives that we might roll out that we have had to think about. Just because the whole world stops? It stops. Do you have an event with Angela Merkel after today's game? No. I think that would be -- unless she was giving me points. : I was thinking about why that is so. And it is part of maybe that the girls are getting older. When the girls were young, we would spend our time, you know, with them. And now we end up seeing them go off on their own. They have got the summer off. You are working. Are they having a good time? They are having a great time.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgeorgestephanopoulosabcnewsgoodmorningamerica", "title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News Good Morning America", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-good-morning-america", "publication_date": "27-06-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 399, "text": "We will make a still available. I believe that is what we will do. Standard practice. And with that, I will take some questions. Darlene. Hi. A couple of questions on Afghanistan. Did they -- did the President not discuss drawing down U.S. troops during the AfPak meeting? As you know -- Was that not a topic of discussion? It was not a topic of discussion. It was not on the agenda. The President has not received yet a recommendation from his commanders or the Secretary of Defense for a troop drawdown figure. That will obviously be a decision he makes relatively soon in keeping with the commitment he made when he announced his AfPak strategy back in December of 2009, that a drawdown would begin in July of 2011. But this was not a subject of today's meeting. Should we expect his announcement this month, or in July, the troop -- I do not have an update on scheduling. Obviously the operative date here is July 2011 in terms of the beginning of the drawdown, but I do not have a date for you. The President said in April that -- in an interview with AP, that the drawdown was going to be significant, and then Gates recently said it was going to be modest. So can you sort of -- is it going to be significant? Well, first of all, as I said, Darlene, the President has yet to make a decision on the numbers. We have always said that it would be real. There were skeptics who suggested at the time when the President announced his policy that the July 201 date for the beginning of a drawdown was not real. It will, in fact, begin then. The President is going to make his decision, as he has said all along, based on conditions on the ground, not whether or not there will be a drawdown, or the beginning of a drawdown, but the size and scope and pace of the drawdown. So, again, he has not made the decision, but it is -- he will make it fairly soon. In an interview earlier today he talked about the fact that this will be a summer of transition and has talked about some of the progress we have made in the mission, including obviously the elimination of Osama bin Laden, the fact that we have taken the fight to al Qaeda effectively, and have al Qaeda back on its heels; there has been some stabilization in Afghanistan, some real progress, that our mission there has achieved; and that it is part of a process that is underway of transferring security lead to the Afghan national security forces. And that process obviously will reach its culmination, as promised in Portugal, at Lisbon, at the NATO conference, will reach its culmination in 2014. Will there be a speech to the nation for this? I do not have a forum or a format or a venue yet for you. Obviously he will make a decision and then inform the public of his decision. But I would not -- speculation not withstanding, I would not put too much credence in that at this point, because he has not yet made a decision. ENTITY, the President gave an interview to a German newspaper over the weekend ahead of Chancellor Merkel's visit tomorrow. He said that the two sides agree on some things and disagree on others. Can you talk about some of the things that they disagree on? I think I'd need something a little specific than that. How about the IMF, and specifically funding for Greece, which is looking for further -- possibly further bailout money? Does the United States, and will the President specifically, encourage Germany to provide that funding in Europe, or would the United States support IMF money going into that again? Well, what we have said and what we continue to say, Jeff, is that our European -- we are in constant communication with our European counterparts about Europe's fiscal -- financial situation, rather. They said -- they have said that they will do whatever is necessary to tackle this problem, and we believe it is completely within their capacity to do that. I do not have any more specifics about it, but that is our position. Well, can -- somebody might hear that and say in their capacity means the U.S. does not want IMF funds, which would, by nature of the IMF, be using U.S. funding as well to go towards Greece. Well, without getting more specific, I think that by saying that it is within their capacity to do that, we believe that they are capable of handling this challenge successfully. And in addition to that issue, can you give us kind of a feel for what else will be discussed between the two leaders tomorrow? Well, I think it is a vital relationship, obviously. Germany is an important partner of ours globally, not just in Europe. And the President very much looks forward to meeting with the Chancellor again. I do not have the number of meetings they have had, but they have been numerous. And he looks forward to her visit and to the meetings that they will have, because it is a very important partnership. Would the President like to see Germany more involved in foreign policy issues such as Libya and Afghanistan? I am sure they will discuss the range of foreign policy issues that are out there that are of common interest to both countries. I think, again, the relationship is important, the cooperation is excellent, and I am sure they will talk about those issues as well as many others. Last question on that. Is this a state visit or an official visit? Now, my understanding, there is a nomenclature here that has to do with whether the visitor is a head of state or a head of government, and my understanding here is that because she is head of government, that this is an official visit. Wasn't it announced as a state visit? I'd have to check. I do not know. Again, this is a semantic technicality. It is official. But it is a state dinner tomorrow, right? It is a state dinner tomorrow. We can get you some of the details of the distinctions, but -- Mark must have gotten the invite. We are just awfully glad that she is coming as head of government of the -- May I help out with this? Yes, please. What can you tell us? Officially it is an official visit, with a state dinner. And the distinction is as you mentioned. I was right, is what he is saying. I always like it when -- Anybody else have something similar to say about my -- It will be -- it will be personal meeting, according to the President in the interview, ENTITY. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you, thank you. In the same way that the President asked General Cartwright to give him an alternative plan when he was coming up with the -- when they were coming up with AfPak plan back in 2009, is he soliciting proposals from any other generals or any other individuals in government as an alternative to the recommendation from the commanders that he is waiting for? Jake, not that I am aware of and I do not think that is the case. What needs to be understood here is that the debate and discussion about the President's AfPak policy took place, as you know, in the fall of 2009 and resulted in the President's decision of the policy that we have been implementing as an administration ever since, both militarily and through our civilian agencies. This decision about the size of the initial drawdown is one in keeping with the decision the President made back in December of 2009. There is not enormous debate about this, despite some reporting to the contrary. In fact, the context for this decision is fairly narrow, which is what -- the President is, as he has all along, moving to the next stage of implementing a policy that he thought long and hard about in making a decision that he made in the fall -- or rather late 2009. So he looks forward to the recommendation that he gets from his commanders through Secretary Gates. I believe if there are options contained within that recommendation I am sure those options will be reviewed and discussed. The way this process normally works, it is rare that there is simply one alternative put on the table. But I do not expect a -- this is not a reopening of a process that was completed in December of 2009. But Gates has said he expects the drawdown to be modest. Do you expect that the recommendation coming from Gates -- Well, I think that depends on -- -- is going to be anything other than a range of modest drawdowns? Again, it depends on how you define what modest is or significant is. The President -- it will be a real drawdown, but it will depend on the conditions on the ground, which he relies on his commanders to inform him about. Now, there will be, I am sure, some discussion about how you implement that decision, but the policy decision has been made. This is a step along the way of implementing that policy. Thursday night, the House -- or Thursday, rather, the House passed a resolution saying that the President has roughly two weeks to provide a whole bunch of information and answer a whole bunch of questions about the Libya military operation with the not-so-veiled threat that the Defense bill is coming up and that funds for that operation could be withheld if answers are not forthcoming. Does the administration intend to answer all of the demands from the House for information? And has the administration sought at all the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel at Department of Justice, as to how closely or whether or not the White House is in compliance with the War Powers Act? As you know, Jake, we believe that we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution on the issue -- But did you seek OLC's guidance on that? I am not aware of any special seeking of guidance that we asked for. We believe we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution. On the question of congressional consultations and the answering of questions, there have been numerous briefings, both classified and unclassified briefings, on the U.S. participation in the NATO mission as well as in -- on our other actions with regard to Libya. And those consultations will continue. And to the extent that those consultations -- within those consultations there are questions asked that we can answer, we will answer them without question. But we feel confident that, A, the President is executing a policy decision that he made in exactly the manner that he said he would; that our consultations have been consistent, and that we are acting consistently with the War Powers resolution; and finally that we would welcome and support a resolution similar to or exactly like the Kerry-McCain resolution in the Senate. So you are not going to provide any paper? It is just if -- Well, I do not know. I mean, if they ask for paper, we may provide paper, but only as part of the general consultations that we have been having. It is simply incorrect to suggest that we have not been informing or consulting with Congress regularly on this important matter, because we have, and we believe it is important to consult with Congress on things like this. I am not suggesting that Congress -- No, I know, I am not suggesting that you are suggesting that. I am simply -- The House is suggesting it very, very clearly. Well, again, I would say that in response to that, we have consulted regularly and we will continue to. And we will answer questions regularly, as we have. It does not sound -- correct me if this interpretation is wrong -- it does not sound like you take this House resolution very seriously. Well, we have said it was unhelpful, and we think it is very important, as we continue to act with our partners, to implement United Nations Security Council 1973 and implement the actions that we have taken, the non-lethal actions we have taken unilaterally and multilaterally -- that we continue to do that. We have made enormous progress. We think the progress will continue. We have been encouraged by the steps taken by the opposition in Libya. We have been encouraged by some of the declarations that they have made about their support for democratic reform. And we are encouraged by the regular indications that those around Muammar Qaddafi are beginning to realize that the future of that regime is very bleak and that the Libyan people need to be the ones who will decide who will lead them into the future. Last question, I am sorry, but it is just the House has passed this resolution fairly handily, clearly indicating they do not feel like they have been consulted enough, demanding a list of information about this operation. You are saying it is not helpful -- you are suggesting that you are not going to provide the information -- No, I did not say that at all. -- in written form unless they specifically request it. You might supply some of it; you might not supply other parts of this information. They have the legal authority to cut off funding for the Libya operation, and the defense bill is coming up in a couple weeks. You are not concerned about this at all? We obviously take seriously our obligation to consult with Congress, and to the extent that there are questions that need to be answered, we will of course endeavor to answer them. And we take seriously concern expressed by members about questions they have about our mission here. We do believe we have acted consistent with the War Powers resolution and we do think it would be -- we would welcome the support of Congress in the form of a resolution similar to the one put forward by senators -- the bipartisan resolution put forward by Senators McCain and Kerry and others. Beyond that, again, it will depend on the consultations we have with Congress, the questions we can answer as we go forward, but we want to continue to keep the pressure on the Qaddafi regime and continue our support for the NATO mission, which is protecting Libyan civilians from Qaddafi's forces. What is Congress has some questions --? Let me -- you know how this works. I will get to you. Go ahead. ENTITY, on Afghanistan, can you give us a sense of the President's process in coming to a decision? I mean, once he surveys his advisors, he sees where they are, what is next? Is he consulting with outside advisors? How often is he consulting with advisors? Well, he consults regularly with his team of national security advisors -- small nsa , not just his single National Security Advisor -- but members of his national security team on this issue. He has his regular Afghan-Pakistan meeting that he had today. And I am sure he will have additional meetings as he begins to consider the recommendations that he receives from Secretary Gates and General Petraeus, and then will evaluate the options before him and make a decision consistent with the original decision that he made in December of 2009 to begin the drawdown in July of 2011. Is he consulting with outside advisors at all? Well, I do not -- in general, the President sometimes seeks input from others who do not work within the administration. I do not know that he is doing that in this case. Again, this is not a debate here about a policy. This is the implementation of a policy that has already been decided on. And so I do not anticipate the seeking of opinion in some broad circle beyond a team of national security advisors that he has a great deal of confidence in. But it sounds like he is getting some -- there will be some differing opinions. It sounds like -- Well, that is why he is President. I mean, he has to make the final decision on these many issues. I would say that everyone understands what the policy decision is -- the policy decision he made in December of 2009; the fact that the beginning of the drawdown will begin in 2011 and will end with the full -- or rather, the process that begins with the drawdown or has begun already but which the drawdown is a part of, which is a transfer of security responsibility to an Afghan lead across the country, will be complete in 2014, as spelled out in Lisbon. And so this is a moment along the way -- it is an important one because it is the implementation of a key element of the policy decision he made in December of 2009, but it is a part of a policy decision; it is not a new thing. And on the golf outing with the Speaker, what is he hoping to achieve with that? Just resolve all their differences, 18 holes. They will have three and a half hours. I mean, really, what are they -- what is he -- Well, look, I think, as the President has said, he likes and gets along with the Speaker of the House. They have obviously spent a fair amount of time together earlier in this year and late last year working on a number of important agreements that were reached, both the tax cut deal in December, and the continuing resolution which secured funding for the government, and spending cuts for the rest of 2011. And obviously they have a lot to talk about. But I think it is -- this is more of a social outing. This is not -- they will not, despite what I just said, they will not resolve the budget negotiations on the back nine. At least I do not expect that. Any tears? I am sorry? Any tears? No, I do not think so. But he is looking forward to it. Will they share a cart? I do not think they have worked out the -- you know how these things are -- they have not worked out the fine details yet. But they -- look, they get along very well, I think. ENTITY, is there -- is President Obama giving any thought to personally attending the next round of deficit-reduction talks later in the week? No. The President had asked his Vice President, Joe Biden, to lead these negotiations. And I would simply say I think that the fact that he did that demonstrated the significance that the President places on these talks. As many of you wrote about or spoke about on air, the Vice President has been a key player in some major negotiations, including those that led to the agreement last December. And it is a fitting role for him to play given his strong relationships on Capitol Hill in both parties. So that process is important. It is very high-level. It involves members of the Senate and the House, in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, appointed by their leaders, so we certainly hope that the leaders have faith in those they appointed to negotiate on their behalf. Obviously, as we get to -- closer to an endpoint in these negotiations, there will no doubt be direct presidential involvement, engagement in some form -- whether that is phone calls or meetings or -- he is the President, and as with the decision he makes on troop drawdowns, that this will be -- when there is a deal, and we are confident there will be a deal, this will be decision that he makes for the administration. But he has a great deal of confidence in the progress the negotiations being led by the Vice President has made. And is there any frustration at the White House about the congressional schedule? One week Senate's here, the next week House is here. Does that make it more difficult? We obviously think it is important that the talks continue, and that is why we have a meeting that the Vice President will lead on Thursday, despite the fact that one of the houses is out. But we understand how this works, and that when you are bringing together members from both houses with members of the administration, that you have to work through scheduling conflicts, and that is what we are trying to do. On Iraq. What is the status of discussions with Iraq on possibly keeping U.S. forces there beyond the end of the year? I have nothing new for you on that. First of all, I'd like to say that we obviously are aware of the fact that we lost U.S. servicemen today, and we express condolences to their families once notifications have been made. And it is a stark reminder that those who serve in Iraq do so in a way that continues to place them at risk, despite the enormous progress that has been made there. And then on your question, I have nothing new to announce. The process, as you know, is simply that we are abiding by the status of forces agreement that will have us withdrawing the remainder of our troops by the end of this year. I and others have said that we will entertain requests by the Iraqi government if -- that we will entertain, in terms of discuss, possible requests for some sort of new status of forces agreement that would be obviously quite different from the one we have now. But as of now, we fully intend to fulfill our obligation under that SOFA and withdraw all our remaining forces. As you know, since the President has come into office, we have withdrawn 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq, and, again, according to the SOFA, we will draw down to zero by the end of the year. Admiral Mullen said in April that without an agreement within weeks, soon, we would have to start making irreversible decisions, he said. Presumably that means start bringing some troops home. Well, we have been bringing troops home consistently, and I think, obviously, there are 52 weeks in a year. And we are moving along according to the existing agreements we have, but obviously we have different means of discussing with the Iraqi government whatever ideas they may have about any other kind of agreement we might reach. But for now, we will keep the commitments that we have made. And there have been no talks on a new SOFA since the -- since Admiral Mullen -- Well, I mean -- I have nothing to announce on that. I have no specific negotiations that are underway. Obviously we are in consultation with the Iraqi government on a regular basis through our ambassador, through our military commander there, and through others, but no talks in that sense. On the President's AfPak decision, is cost in any way a factor of how many troops are brought home next month? Or the initial drawdown -- No. -- does cost impact that at all? No, as I said before in response to a question regarding a story about this, obviously, as enormously powerful and wealthy we are as a country, we have limited resources, and we have to make decisions -- the President has to make decisions about priorities. Having said that, his policy decision that he made in December of 2009 had as its objectives not -- had disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, and stabilize Afghanistan so it would not become a haven for terrorists as it had been in the past, terrorists who have designs on the United States and its allies. Those are the objectives, and the decisions he will make going forward regarding withdrawal and troop drawdowns will be based on the success of fulfilling those objectives and the conditions on the ground as he makes those decisions. And not cost? Well, certainly within the broader sense of we have limited resources, we have to make decisions about our priorities, obviously every decision is made with a mind towards cost, but this is about U.S. national security interests, primarily. I just want to close the loop on something you responded to earlier on Afghanistan. There is no -- the policy decision has been made. That is not changing. That is not what is up to review. Correct. This is simply about the number of troops that come home, period. Right. Okay, this is -- fair enough. On Libya, the -- you said it was unhelpful. Do you plan on responding to what the resolution called for, which is an explanation in 14 days? I do not have anything new for you on that beyond my answer to the question about this earlier. Again, we believe we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution. You do not believe you owe them any more explanation? Well, we owe them in a sense that we owe -- and we have said repeatedly, both prior to and throughout this period when there is been a mission in Libya, that we feel obligated to consult regularly with Congress. And we have. Why do they disagree? There are always disagreements in Washington about different things. I think the overall thing that we agree on is that we need to make sure that the NATO mission succeeds. We need to make sure through the non-lethal measures that we have embarked upon that we continue to keep the pressure on Qaddafi, and ensure that Libya in the future has -- its people have the opportunity to choose their future. And I think that we enjoy broad support within Congress for those goals. But the Senate has yet to pass this resolution -- you brought up Kerry-McCain -- Well, we do not obviously control -- we do not control the congressional calendar, regrettably. But the -- our position on that has not changed. We believe that there is bipartisan support for the actions that we are taking, and we would welcome an expression of it. And I know John Brennan is in the region right now -- Yemen -- has anybody in the administration been in touch with President Saleh in Saudi Arabia? Not that I am aware of with President Saleh. As you know, John Brennan has been in touch with the Vice President, the acting President in President Saleh's absence. Has he asked him to -- Well, I do not want to get into the detail -- Is it the same message to him as it was to Saleh? Agree to this transition of power? Could you expound upon what did he say -- Yes, the -- our position is that we support the agreement that President Saleh had talked about signing several times and did not , which would lead to a transfer of power. And we also have supported and we made calls for cessation of violence, and we mean that on both sides. And we want a peaceful and orderly transition, and that is consistent with the Yemenis' constitutional process; and we -- our position has not changed, and we believe that an immediate transition is in the best interests of the people and the best interests of maintaining stability in obviously a very unstable situation. Has Saudi Arabia been helpful to us on this? Well, Saudi Arabia is an important ally of ours, and obviously John Brennan -- Have they helped the situation? I think it is fair to say they have been helpful, and as our -- as have others in the region who have worked with us and others to try to bring about a transition there that is best -- is in the best interest of the people of Yemen, and from our perspective in the best interest of the national security interest of the United States. The Fed nominee is withdrawing his nomination. Does the White House or the administration already have other people queued up, considering Congress has blocked at least three or four nominees -- What I can say on that is that we will move quickly, we will move forward as soon as possible with a replacement nominee. I will take this opportunity to, again, as I did on paper, express our disappointment with the partisan obstructionism that led to Mr. Diamond to withdraw his nomination. I mean, this is an enormously qualified candidate, and you know the process is broken when a Nobel laureate in economics is denied a post in the Federal Reserve. And that is a problem. And we regret that very much. And we certainly echo the sentiment that Peter Diamond expressed in his op-ed this morning. And what is the impact -- I guess it may be hard to assess for him in particular for the Fed board -- but the impact of nominees not getting into their positions more broadly -- Well, more broadly, look, we have obviously a situation, when we talk about economic appointments, where this is a top priority of the President, it is the top priority supposedly of Congress, both parties, both Houses, and it is vital that we have people in positions, whether it is at the Fed or elsewhere, who are capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of the jobs that they have been nominated for in the name of improving the economic situation in this country. And again, when you have highly qualified, highly regarded nominees for posts like this, they should be -- the Senate should act accordingly and allow that nomination to go forward. And this is somebody, in the case of Peter Diamond, who had benefited from bipartisan support on several occasions through committee votes. So it is very regrettable. And just one more question on Libya. I know you were already asked this already, but if the administration has consistently consulted Congress, why do they continue to have so many questions? Well, look, it is their prerogative to have questions, and it is our obligation to answer those questions. I think that is partly how the process works. So we do not have a problem with the fact that they have additional questions. And we will endeavor to answer those questions, as we have throughout this process. Was the White House surprised by Peter Diamond's op-ed? No. And was there more that the White House or the President could have done to get his nomination through? I do not believe so. And for Merkel's meeting tomorrow, the President in his radio address cited the European debt crisis as one of the headwinds that is leading to a struggling recovery now. Is that something that he will stress with the German Chancellor tomorrow? I am sure it will be part of their conversation. Obviously the economy writ large is an issue that is of interest to both leaders and it is an issue that both are addressing in different ways. So absolutely, as the President noted in his address and has noted elsewhere, we have been hit with obviously the fallout from the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, high energy prices, and the continuing drag presented by the European -- euro zone economic issue. So I am sure that in many ways all three of those will be topics of conversation between the Chancellor and the President. And will the selection process for the next IMF head be part of the agenda? It is certainly possible. Again, I think the President has made clear what his view is, which is we support the timetable laid out by the IMF and we support the selection of the most qualified nominee. Do you expect them to talk about Christine Lagarde's candidacy, specifically? Not that I am aware of that they would speak about a specific candidacy, but I do not want to rule out what could be brought up. About a third of the troops in Afghanistan are not American. Is there a sense that the decision the President makes on a troop withdrawal will influence what allies do? And is there a fear that a precipitous withdrawal will take them out as well? Well, again, there is not going to be anything -- there is not going to be a precipitous withdrawal -- precipitous being an adjective that suggests haste that is not thought through, perhaps. And I think that the point has always been that this will be driven by a process that reviews the conditions on the ground, reviews the options presented by commanders on the ground through the Secretary of Defense, and will be very -- as reflected in the decision originally to -- with the policy decision he made in December of 2009 will be very deliberate and thought through. So I think we -- it is an international coalition. We work -- we coordinate with our allies and we will obviously inform our allies of our decision once it is made. But I think that the kind of cooperation we have had there will continue. And given that the last combat troops are scheduled to leave in 2014, in the context of a decade-long war, this is not a huge window. So talk about why this first July drawdown is so significant, given that tens of thousands of troops will be out by 2014 regardless. Well, it is the beginning of a process. It is important to remember that when the President came into office, there were a certain number of troops and he has increased them significantly because of his focus on the need to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda where al Qaeda central was located, in the AfPak region. That is where the attacks on 9/11 emanated from and obviously, as we discovered not that long ago, the region where Osama bin Laden himself was hiding. So he followed through on his commitment that he made in his campaign to refocus our attention on the original fight here, the fight that was so important, and we now have, because of the surge, so-called surge, reached a troop level that is allowing us -- has allowed us to make important progress in terms of stabilizing Afghanistan and beginning the process of transferring security lead over to the Afghan security forces. We are now at a point, as envisioned by the President's policy, where we can begin the drawdown. And the pace and slope will depend on conditions on the ground, but it will begin. And I take your point, but obviously how that is spaced out between now and 2014 will -- there is some room to decide what that slope looks like. And that is -- this is the first of those decisions. On that slope, the recommendation that the President gets, does he expect it to be more than just a July number? How much of the glide slope will be outlined in this recommendation? And if it is not fairly specific, do you revisit this every month in the monthly updates on how many troops we could bring back and when? Well, without anticipating or boxing in Secretary Gates or General Petraeus, I think that obviously this will be a proposal that looks at the situation we have now and envisions what the situation will be going forward. But as has always been the case, the process will be revisited according to what is happening on the ground. I mean, I think it would be foolish to say that a certain portion will come out today and a certain portion on six months and three days from now. I think that the answer is yes and no. Is there middle ground, though, I wonder, in the sense that you -- we know where you want to be in 2014. You might not be able to put exact numbers to exact dates, but will there be certain mileposts you set down between then and now that you can revisit based on -- Not that I can announce from now. I will leave that to the President to announce what decision he makes when he makes it. Again, we are still premature here because he has not even been given a formal recommendation by the Secretary of Defense on this. So to anticipate how that will look I think would be foolhardy on my part. In thinking about how he will convey this to the American people, do you think he will speak -- sort of review his policy and look forward over the next three years at all? Again, I think we are getting ahead of the process here. I am sure he will convey it. Suggestions for how and the format are way ahead of where we are right now. Thanks, ENTITY. Can I go back to Julianna's question about Peter Diamond? You said you thought that the White House did everything possible to push this nomination forward. Can you just outline what all you did do? I mean, did the President pick up the phone and call Mr. Shelby? Did he -- I do not have a tick-tock on the different actions that different members of the administration took in support of this nomination. We strongly supported it. We thought he was highly qualified. We regret that it is come to this and he is withdrawn his nomination for understandable reasons. Again, he had -- enjoys significant bipartisan support, as he should have, given his qualifications. And we think that the suggestion that he is somehow not qualified is just ridiculous because he is so qualified for this job. And more broadly, it is just -- it is important for us to move forward in this process because these posts need to be filled precisely because we have such important issues before us in dealing with the economy. And so we look forward to working with Congress, working with the Senate, to get the nominee who replaces Mr. Diamond confirmed and other nominations that are still pending confirmed. What kind of message, though, does this send to other potential nominees? Well, I hope it is isolated. I hope that the process can move forward. And it is not -- I am not suggesting that it is uniform. We have had obviously some nominees move forward and we appreciate that and we'd like to see others move forward. Yes, ENTITY, two questions on do not ask, do not tell. Under the repeal law that President Obama signed in December, do not ask, do not tell will not be off the books until 60 days pass following certification from the President, the Defense Secretary, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A lot of people who worked to pass the repeal legislation late last year are becoming worried if that certification does not take place before the end of this month, after September 4th, Secretary Gates retires, that there could be additional delays as we wait for Leon Panetta to come into position. So does the President want to see certification for do not ask, do not tell this month? I mean, I think the process is moving at the pace that we anticipated, and I also think that it is the President's policy and that it will be implemented regardless of who is Secretary of Defense. But the President -- the administration is surely concerned that if we wait until Leon Panetta comes in there could be additional delays -- We do not share that concern, no. ENTITY, could you talk to us about the official relationship now with the United States government and the Taliban? Secretary Gates made some statements over the weekend, and if you could kind of flesh that out for us -- Well, I am not -- you'd have to be more specific about what kind of statements he made. He was talking -- at the Asian Security Conference, he was talking about how in time we could work together, and things of that nature; there will be a relationship with the United States government and the Taliban. Could you talk -- give us any kind of information on that as the President is looking to draw down troops and bring everyone home by -- I think what this refers to is our oft-stated support for the reconciliation process that President Karzai has begun. The important contingencies -- or rather, the conditions of reconciliation -- not contingencies but conditions -- are renouncing violence, renouncing terrorism, laying down your arms, and abiding by the Afghan constitution. So obviously there has to be a political settlement in Afghanistan, and obviously that would have to include elements of the Taliban. And we support that process. Now, if at some future date when there is, we hope, relative peace in Afghanistan and there is been a robust and successful reconciliation effort, the people who used to be members of the Taliban who are now reconciled into the Afghan government, and we have a relationship with the Afghan government, then obviously that would include elements of the Taliban from the past. But again, the process for getting to reconciliation is not simply saying, I'd like to reconcile. And going back to what you just said, elements of the Taliban from the past, there is a history there. And I mean, are we at this point able to trust, to trust whatever the Taliban says and does? Well, there is an important thing to make sure is clear here, which is this is a process that is being undertaken by President Karzai, who is President of the country and believes that reconciliation is essential for a long-term solution in Afghanistan. We support him in that and agree with him. There obviously are irreconcilable elements, and we are taking the fight in Afghanistan to those elements, and have made progress and halted the Taliban's momentum. But going forward, reconciliation has to be a part of Afghanistan's future, and we support that process. When the President plays golf with the Speaker, will you ask them to let the pool see them tee off? I could ask. I do not have anything for you on the press circumstances surrounding that event as of yet. As you know, the President has not been completely -- It is way off in the future. -- transparent about his golf game or let the pool see him start or finish. I think the President enjoys playing golf on occasion in part because it is a nice break. There are not that many opportunities that a President gets to get outside and be away from the trappings of office. But in terms of the specific golf date that you mentioned, I do not have anything for you yet on how we are going to cover that. ENTITY, first of all, is that your swing that you were showing us -- I am a terrible golfer, yes. I was hoping you could tell us a little bit -- considering the national security challenges that are on the President's plate right now -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, et cetera, you know the list -- and what we saw last week in terms of the economic recovery slowing down, could you talk to us a little bit in terms of how he is balancing these two? You do not really have much of a choice when you become President. These are the two priorities you are handed, and for good reason: the national security of the United States, protecting the people of the United States at home and abroad, and the economic vitality, growth, and job creation of the nation. And these are the two priorities that the President focuses on every day. And these are complicated times, and obviously when he took office, we were in economic freefall, and that was the focus, appropriately, of the media's attention, of the country's attention, and the President's attention. But it is often lost -- or we forget sometimes that he also when he came into office inherited two wars that he had to spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of fulfilling his promise to draw down and end -- draw down troops and end the war in Iraq, a promise that he is keeping; and also the promises he made about how to successfully prosecute our effort in Afghanistan, another promise that he is keeping. And these are -- you cannot -- you do not have a choice. You have to do both, and that is just a reality of the office. And it is why it is such an important one. Just a quick follow-up. I feel like I missed this over the course of the last few months -- I might have been on vacation or something -- but when did the President stop doing the daily presidential economic daily briefing? I think it happens periodically -- But it used to be a daily thing with the PDB. I am just curious when it stopped being a daily thing. I will have to go check. Again, it sort of happens occasionally, does not happen all the time. And I think that was always the case, but I can check. I do not have any scheduling changes to announce, but -- Last week an al Qaeda spokesperson released a video statement saying something to the extent of a good way to get access to firearms is through gun show loopholes in America. And I am wondering how serious the White House is taking this statement, and also if they have directed the Justice Department to look into the matter. And how do gun control policies stand -- I am sorry, gun control policy talks stand with the administration? I know there was a task force that convened at the Justice Department a little while ago, but we have not heard an update since then. I honestly am not aware of the statement that you mentioned, Sam. And I would encourage you to go to the Justice Department on it. We are very mindful of any threats emanating from al Qaeda and take them seriously, so I am sure that the appropriate folks are aware of it and acting on it. But I will have to send you to Justice for that. Yes, ma'am, in the green. Thank you, ENTITY. The President is playing golf; do you have his -- what is his handicap? What is his handicap? Yes. That is classified. I cannot -- Please. Is Boehner giving him strokes? We have not -- I do not think any of that has been worked out. Again, I think this is just an opportunity for the two men to spend some time together. As the President has said, and I think the Speaker probably shares this opinion, that this is useful and valuable because they obviously both have a lot of responsibility for the kinds of decisions that need to be made in this country on behalf of the American people. So the fact that they can spend a few hours together playing golf I think is absolutely a good thing. And how that game goes, we will just have to see. Will it be a foursome? I do not have anything on who else will be playing. Thank you, ENTITY. On the debt ceiling, for the rest of the world, it is very difficult to understand what is going on in Washington because most of the country do not have those system, and for the rest of the world, it seems to be another political battle in Washington. But this one is different in nature because this one put the entire international financial community in danger if the U.S. Treasury could default. Right. So what is your message for the international community? And are you confident that you can resolve the issue by August 2nd? We are confident that Congress will vote to raise the debt ceiling. We believe that members of Congress have heard about the imperative here not just from us but from a variety of places and that that message is getting through; and it is one that is been expressed by leaders of Congress of both parties. And to your point, Toshi, it is not just the international financial community that would be adversely affected by a default. Everyone in this country would be adversely affected by a default. The consequences for the economy would be very serious, very grave, and that would affect growth. It would affect jobs. It would affect retirement accounts. It would affect every single American. And to your point in terms of the global impact, it would affect people around the world. And that is why it is so important to take this vote. It is a different circumstance than exists in a lot of countries. What people need to understand is that this vote, which is always one that the Congress is resistant to taking for understandable reasons, is to lift the debt ceiling in order to pay the obligations that the government has already made. This is not a decision to spend money. This is a decision to honor the obligations already made by the United States government, by the Congress, by administrations of both parties. And it has to be done because defaulting on our obligations, defaulting on the full faith and credit of the United States government would be a terrible, terrible idea with unpredictable consequences.

{"id": 225, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the ENTITY Thank you! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I am sorry; that is all the time we have. Thank you for joining us. This is a nice set. Thank you very much. It reminds me of the convention. We actually bought it. It was in a warehouse and we bought it. We had it chiseled. Let me give you Mug Force One. This is yours. Oh, nice. There is no water in it; let me get some for you. I will get that on the thing there. Thank you so much for coming by. There you go. It is fresh. It is fresh. Does that happen to you wherever you go? Is that just a wild when you because when you guys go to work, do people typically applaud? It is a nice feeling. It was a wonderful welcome. It does not happen, for example, when I go to the Republican caucus meetings. I see; slightly different. So here you are Here I am. you are two years into your administration, and the question that arises in my mind, are we the people we were waiting for? Or does it turn out those people are still out there and we do not have their number? How are you feeling about that? Well, you know, I am feeling great about where the American people are, considering what we have gone through. I mean, we have gone through the two toughest years of any time since the Great Depression. And in light of that, the fact that people have been resilient, that folks are still out there working and opening businesses and, you know, working in the community, looking after their families, taking care of their responsibilities, that is encouraging. So, there is still a lot of good stuff happening. But people are frustrated. You know, a lot of people are hurting out there, still, and you know, in that environment, I think they are hoping that we can do a little bit better here in Washington than we have been doing. Now, do you is that do you feel that as well? Because it is you know, you are coming from a place, you ran on very high rhetoric, hope and change, and the Democrats this year seem to be running on, please, baby, one more chance. Now, how did we go, in two years, from hope and change, we are the people we have been looking for to, you are not going to give them the keys, are you? Is it are you disappointed in how it is gone? Are you surprised that other people, even your base, can be disappointed? Or do you reject that narrative? You know, look, when I won and we started the transition, and we looked at what was happening in the economy, a whole bunch of my political folks came up and said, you know what, enjoy this now, because two years from now, folks are going to be frustrated. And that is in fact what is happened. When you have got 9.6 percent unemployment, when folks are seeing their homes underwater, when the economy is growing, but is still not growing as fast as it needs to to make up for the 8 million jobs that were lost, yeah, folks are going to be frustrated, and that is going to reflect itself in the political environment. But having said that, I look over the last 18 months and I say, we prevented a second Great Depression, we have stabilized the economy, an economy that was shrinking is now growing, we have got nine months of consecutive private-sector job growth, we have passed historic health- care reform, historic financial regulatory reform, we have done things that some folks do not even know about. What have you done that we do not know about? Are you planning a surprise party for us filled with jobs and health care? No, but you know, when you look at what we have done in terms of making sure that before we even passed health care, 4 million kids got health insurance that did not have it before, through the Children's Health Insurance Program. Expanded national service more than at any time since the beginning of the Peace Corps, made sure that credit card companies could not jack up your rates without notice. Over and over again, we have moved forward an agenda that is making a difference in people's lives each and every day. Now, is it enough? No. And so I expect, and I think most Democrats out there expect, that people want to see more progress. Right. But certainly in terms of the folks who voted for me, my expectation and hope is, if you look at the track record that we have accomplished in very difficult circumstances over the last 18 months, we have done an awful lot that we talked about during the campaign, and we are going to do more in the years to come. Well, that is what we will do, we are going to take a commercial break and we are going to come back and talk a little bit about how that progress will be or what the process was like; we will be back with ENTITY. We are back. We are here with ENTITY. So let us talk about you know, you were talking about a list of accomplishments that you feel very proud of that the Democratic Party you know, they do not seem to be running on the list of accomplishments. If anything, you know, I saw a commercial of a guy in West Virginia running for Senate, Manchin, who he took a rifle He shot the thing. and he shot the cap and trade bill. And I thought, oh, gosh, the Republicans are so oh, that is a Democrat? Oh, that is interesting. Have you convinced your own party that the legislative progress has been enough, and how do you feel about their reaction to it? Look, let me say this about members of Congress. Are you going to curse? No, I am not going to curse. I know a lot of folks feel frustrated about Congress, how it operates, the bickering, the weird rules, the filibusters, all that stuff. But the fact is that there are a bunch of folks who, during the course of this year, took really tough votes that they knew were bad politics because they thought they were the right things to do. There were a whole bunch of Democrats guys like Tom Perriello in Virginia, or John Boccieri in Ohio, or Betsy Markey in Colorado, who are basically in Republican districts. You know, they won in the big surge that we had in 2008, they knew it was going to be a tough battle, that these are generally pretty conservative districts, and yet still went ahead and did what they thought was right. And my hope in this election is that people who vote on the basis of what they think is right and have integrity and are not just thinking about the next election but are thinking about the next generation, that they are rewarded. Now, that is tough in this political process, because you have got millions of dollars of independent money that is pouring into those races, they are being hammered by negative ads every single day. And the question then becomes, do the millions of voices who came out in 2008, who said folks were interested in fixing our health-care system, wanted a serious energy policy, wanted the kinds of changes in our student loan program that have allowed millions more kids to have access to college that is what we ran on, that is what we have delivered and my hope is that those people are rewarded for taking those tough votes. And if they are, then I think Democrats will do fine on Election Day. Is the difficulty that you have here the distance between what you ran on and what you delivered? Is that you ran with such, if I may, audacity, you know so much of what you said was, great leaders lead in a time of opportunity, we are the ones we are looking for, yet legislatively it has felt timid at times. I am not even sure at times what you want out of a health-care bill. And this is ENTITY, I love your show, but Very kind of you. but this is something where, you know, I have a profound disagreement with you. And I do not want to lump you in with a lot of other pundits but You may. no, no look, this notion that health care was timid, you have got 30 million people who are going to get health insurance as a consequence of this. Right. You have got a patient's bill of rights that makes sure that insurance companies cannot drop you when you get sick, if you have been paying premiums, that makes sure there are not lifetime limits, makes sure kids who do not have health insurance can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26, and cuts the deficit by over $1 trillion. This is what I think most people would say is as significant a piece of legislation as we have seen in this country's history. And the notion that but what happens is what happens is, it gets discounted because the presumption is, well, we did not get 100 percent of what we wanted, we got 90 percent of what we wanted, so let us focus on the 10 percent we did not get as opposed to the 90 percent that we did. And right now there is a woman in New Hampshire who does not have to sell her house to get her cancer treatments because of that health-care bill. And she does not think it is inconsequential. She does not think it is timid. The suggestion was not that it is inconsequential or that it does not help The suggestion was that it was timid. Timid. Yeah, that was And I will tell you what I mean, and I do not mean to lump you in with other presidents. But I think if I were to try and coalesce, I think, whatever criticism of it may be, it is that you ran on the idea that this system needed basic reform Yeah. It feels like some of the reforms that have passed, like health care, have been done in a very political manner that has papered over a foundation that is corrupt. And I thought that That I think is fair, which is here is what I think is fair. That, over the last two years, in an emergency situation Right. our basic attitude was, we have gotta get some things done, in some cases quickly, that are in order to do that, basically worked with the process as opposed to transformed the process. And there is no doubt that that frustrated folks. It frustrates me. Look, I would love not to have a 60-vote requirement, which is not in the Constitution, but is in the Senate rules right now, that apply to everything we do, so I cannot get a deputy secretary of Treasury in the middle of a financial crisis because somebody's holding it up and is filibustering the appointment. So there are all kinds of things that happened during the course of these two years in terms of process that I'd like to see changed. Keep in mind that those areas where we had control over process, we actually made changes. So you know, we have got a whole bunch of rules about lobbyists interacting with the White House that are very different from any White House before. If somebody wants to come to visit the White House now, that list is given out to everybody. That is a change, but Did you just invite me to the White House? No, no. Because we'd have to disclose it and I do not think you would actually Right. You do not want people knowing that I was over there. Exactly. Let me explain more specifically, because I think that is , you know to say within the system/without the system, you know, in the health-care bill Yeah. you worked within the system. You know, during the campaign there was talk that we were going to be able to negotiate prices with Canadian pharmaceutical companies. Right. A deal was made with them, $80 billion over 10 years; okay, that seems like a quid pro quo, that seemed reasonable, but there is other things with the insurance companies. You know, I was talking with a woman in the audience before the show and she brought up an interesting point. You know, 2014 is when these exchanges kick in and there will be some sort of price controls, but up until that point there is really nothing in this bill that does not allow these insurance companies to raise rates. Not true. In fact, what we have done is we have empowered state insurance commissioners to review the rate hikes that are taking place in states. In some states, like North Carolina, they have already used it and rolled back premium increases by 25 percent. Does not that only trip, though, on egregious raises, like 30 do not they know, like, if you raise it 30 percent, so they raise it 29? You know, is that If if if the point, ENTITY, is that overnight we did not transform the health-care system, that point is true. Well, when you put it that way, it seems so petty! When I say that when we promised during the campaign, change you can believe in, it was not , change you can believe in in 18 months. It was, change you can believe in, but you know what, we are going to have to work for it. And the history of this country Yeah Let me make this point, because I think it is really important. Look, when Social Security was passed, it applied to widows and orphans, and it was a very restricted program. And over time, that structure that was built ended up developing into the most important social safety net that we have in our country. The same is true on every piece of progressive legislation, every bit of progress that we have made. When the Civil Rights Act passed, there were still a bunch of folks down South who could not vote. And you know, I am sure there were a bunch of commentators out there who said, you know what, this law's not doing the job, there is still folks who are not able to exercise their franchise. But the point was that we had created a structure, we had put a framework in place, that allowed us then to continue to make progress. That is what we have done over the last 18 months. That is what I expect we are going to keep on doing as long as I have got the capacity to do it, as long as I am ENTITY. All right, sir. We are going to take a commercial break and come back with more ENTITY. Welcome back to the show ENTITY. You expressed some frustration with those on the left that are still feeling dissatisfied. Do you think in any way the expectation was something that maybe even you and your campaign created? Were people being naive, in the sense of I remember very clearly you said, you know, we cannot expect different results with the same people. Right. And I remember when you hired Larry Summers I remember thinking, well, that seems like the exact same person No, no, no and why would you so in some respects, I get your frustration with this idea that, well, jeez, are you never satisfied? But again, the expectation, I think, was audacity, going in there and really rooting out a corrupt system. And so the sense is, has reality of what hit you in the face when you first stepped in, caused you to back down from some of the more visionary like bringing in a guy like Larry Summers, like First of all, if you look at how we have handled this financial crisis Right. if you had told me two years ago that we are going to be able to stabilize the system, stabilize the stock market, stabilize the economy, and, by the way, at the end of this thing, it'll cost less than 1 percent of GDP where the S&L crisis cost us 2.5 percent of our entire economy for a much smaller crisis, I'd say, we will take that, because we saved taxpayers a whole lot of money. And in fairness, Larry Summers did a heckuva job trying to figure out how to You do not want to use that phrase, dude. Pun intended. All right. You know, Larry was integral in helping to think through some really complicated stuff. Now, you know, the notion is, I think, that somehow managing a crisis of this magnitude is a matter of black-and-white and you have got some clear decisions that you can make and here is how you can do it and you shut down these banks and push this stuff aside, and somehow it is all going to be right. It turns out that, at every juncture where we are making decisions, we have got to make some calculations. If you shut down this bank, does that mean that you are going to have a cascade of 100 other banks that are going to be shut down? Does that mean that taxpayers suddenly have to pay for all that? Is that going to cost more taxpayer money? So a lot of the debates that were taking place in terms of financial regulatory reform, in terms of how to stabilize the financial system, were ones that required some expertise Right. and Larry helped to provide that. Now, having said that Yeah. I appreciate you being polite. It is just really hard not to talk! I know. Can I ask just one thing? If they had told you the same thing, stabilize the banks, stabilize the Dow, unemployment will be near 10 percent, would you have taken that deal? You know, if I had the capacity to have prevented the unemployment that happened, basically before we put our economic plan into place, obviously, we would've done that. But the problem was, we lost 4 million jobs before I was sworn in, 750,000 jobs the month I was sworn in, 600,000 the month after that, 600,000 the month after that. So most of the jobs that we lost were lost before the economic policies we put into place had any effect. And the but I want to go back to your earlier point, which is this notion that, you know, folks, I think, hoped that we could completely transform Washington. I understand that impulse. There are some very good people here, some good public servants who work very hard. There are some folks who are not so good, and the culture here is not always real healthy, and we are going to have to people chuckle here, yeah and so bringing about change in terms of how the legislative process operates, in terms of the power that lobbyists have, the power the special interests have, you know, that is a work in progress. It is just not going to happen overnight. But I do not regret, during the campaign, having said that we can change that process, we can make it more transparent. It is not going to be ideal. We can reduce the power of special interests, although special interests are still going to have power in a democracy. They are going to be able to petition their government, like everybody else, and they have got a lot of lobbyists and a lot of the cash to do it, but we can limit the amount of power that have. We can make sure that as a White House we are more open than previous White Houses. You know, there are folks, I am sure, who do not think that we have achieved the ideal. And so I guess on all these issues, my attitude is, if we are making progress step-by-step, inch- by-inch, day-by-day, that we are being true to the spirit of that campaign So you would not say you'd run this time as a pragmatist? You would not it would not be, yes, we can given certain conditions and No. No, I think what I would say is, yes, we can, but it is not it is not going to happen overnight. Do you believe government is nimble enough to handle these 21st-century crises? Is government agile enough? You know, you said, we want to build a 21st-century regulatory regime for business. By the time government builds that, obviously it'll be the 22nd century. But will not they have already started trading molecules in some sort of weird you know, does government still have the ability to be agile enough to handle these types of things? I think it is a legitimate question. I will tell you that there are a couple of things that have changed in our politics that are going to have to be fixed. One is the way the filibuster operates. As I said, that is just not in the Constitution. In fairness, Democrats used it when Bush was in office and felt very comfortable using it, although not to the extent that it is being used today. What we have been seeing is unprecedented. And that makes it very difficult for us to move forward in serious ways, and actually reduces compromise, because what ends up happening is that if Republicans know that they can block anything because we do not have 60 votes, then they feel no need to compromise. That means the Democrats, then their attitude is, well, we are not going to compromise; we cannot get 60 votes, and everybody moves in opposite directions. The same thing is true, I think, when it comes to how our districts are drawn. You know, we have got a lot of districts these days that are so safe 90 percent Democrat or 90 percent Republican that that also helps to polarize the electorate, so there are a couple of things that are structural that are probably going to need to be changed. But having said all that, we have made a lot of progress over the last 18 months that, from a historical perspective, you know, ranks up there with any legislative session we have seen in history. And we are going to have to continue to make some progress on things like energy, which did not get done, on immigration reform, that did not get done. And most importantly we have just got to do a lot more work in terms of generating the kind of jobs that ensure we have got a growing middle class and that people are able to live out the American dream, because right now I think there are a lot of folks who are worried that if we do not make serious investments in education, in energy, in infrastructure, in research and development, that we are going to start falling behind. Well, I thank you for being here, for taking the time. I know you are a very busy man, you have got lots to do. Well, ENTITY, I appreciate this. You know, the one other thing that might have made a difference is if you had held the Rally to Restore Sanity two years ago. That might have I did not know you could do that. That might have made a difference, but I enjoyed it. Can I just make a plug, just to vote. Make sure that folks out there I did not know where you were going with that. When you said, can I just make a plug, I was like, are you dropping an album? What is happening here? Go out there and vote November 2nd. A lot of you have early voting in your states; make sure to make use of it. Thank you, sir.

{"id": 394, "text": "Just a block from here, you may not have known it, you drove by houses with holes still in the roof, where there'd been live rescues. There is still FEMA markings in spray paint. And yet, New Orleans is like this. This is a symbol of recovery. Katrina was about so many things. It was about class and race and government and - and the environment. What ever happened to that national conversation we were supposed to have about it? Well, I think that we are still having it. I - I do not think that conversation happens in - one instance. I think that there is a constant evolving debate about what are our obligations to each other. How do we make sure that in moments of devastation that we are looking out for one another? How does government organize itself, both at the federal level interacting with state and local officials? How do we make sure that folks who were already vulnerable before a catastrophe hits are not made worse off as a consequence of it? And, you know, what you have seen I think in New Orleans is steady progress. But, you know, we have still got a long way to go. And part of the reason that I wanted to come down here today to mark the fifth anniversary, was just to send a message to the people of New Orleans, but also the entire Gulf Coast, that they have , you know, gotten hit pretty good over the last several years. And all of America, not just people here, not just folks in the White House, but all of America, remains concerned and remains committed to their rebuilding. Do you still get driven to anger over it when you see those pictures again after five years? Oh, absolutely. The - the children, the old folks, the people suffering in this city? Oh, well, you know, I still remember - I was in a London hotel room. I had just come back with Republican Senator Luger on a fact finding trip on nuclear issues. And we had gotten in - into London, we were at the hotel, and we suddenly we just saw this thing unfold. In ways that were searing to anybody with a conscience. And, you know, frankly, were a shock, I think, to many of us who did not think that something like that could happen in America. And you know, I meant - I meant - I referred today in my speech, immediately afterwards I flew back, went down to Houston with President Clinton and the first President Bush. And talked to folks who were - at that point - and I do not think even at that time we realized the full scope of the - of the disaster. But what - what it did do, though, was reawaken, I hope, a sense that we are all in this thing together. That, you know, we may be divided along political lines. We may have arguments, ideologically, about the best way to approach this or that problem. But when you have got something like a Katrina happen. When you have got major disasters. When you see people who are doing their best, but have just been overwhelmed that we have got to put all that stuff aside. And come in and make sure that we get the job done. The folks here still want a lot from you. I have been talking to them for a week. What would they ask you? They want you to come spend the night. They want you to treat their wetlands like an emergency, like the TVA or the Marshall Plan, because as they always say, they are losing a football field an hour. Right. Perversely, could BP money pay for the - the reengineering and the preservation of the wetlands potentially? Well, I think what everybody's understood is that we can build the best levees in the world. And we - we are going to be be on schedule for next year having gotten - all the levees strengthened, so that they can withstand a hundred year surge. You are confident? Well, I - we are on schedule right now. And I am going to be keep on making sure that we stay on schedule. We have already fortified 220 miles of levees. But the - the real protection for New Orleans and for the Gulf are the wetlands. And that is an environmental disaster that had been occurring long before Katrina. And I think in light of what is happened with the oil spill, this is an opportunity for us to take a look comprehensively all along the coast and say, How do we do things better? How do we do things smarter than we have done before? I assigned Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, who is a son of the Gulf. Former mayor, former governor of Mississippi. He is been traveling and listening and talking to folks all across this region. He will be working with our EPA director. All of our various agencies that are involved. To find out ways that we can leverage as much as possible the money that is going to be but needed for short term repair to make sure that we are doing things smarter over the long term. This was, of course, New Orleans' Katrina and Mississippi's Katrina. And you are familiar now that it is getting baked in a little bit in the media that BP was ENTITY's Katrina. And it is also getting baked in that the Administration was slow off the mark. Is that unfair? Well, I - it is just not accurate. If you take a look at our response the only thing in common we had with - the Katrina response was Thad Allen, who came in and helped to organize rescue efforts - and he did so under Katrina, he did so for us. But if you look, we had immediately thousands of vessels, tens of thousands of people who are here. And what we are seeing now is that we have got a lot more work to do. But the fact is because of the sturdiness and swiftness of the response, there is a lot less oil hitting these shores and these beaches than anybody would have anticipated, given the volume that was coming out of - the - the BP - oil - oil well. You believe it is still out there, though? Oh, absolutely. It - there is no doubt, but what we have seen is - is that the skimming, the burning, all the efforts that took place in coordination with local folks here, who often times new the landscape and new the waters better than any federal official did. As a consequence of that not only have we been able to stop the well. But we have actually seen less damage than might have occurred had we not had that kind of a response. Now, the key is to make sure that we are monitoring it carefully, based on sound science. And that it is a sustained effort over time. That is something that I am committed to. Let us talk about another topic that is part of the firmament here and everywhere. And that is the economy. The New York Times said this weekend, ENTITY has another new plan on the economy. Now would be a good time to find out about it. Do you have anything new on the economy? And while you have been away, we had a horrible GDP number last month. Well, look, we - we anticipated that the recovery was slowing. The economy is still growing, but it is not growing as fast as it needs to. I have got things right now in - before Congress that we should move immediately. And I have said so before I went on vacation, and I will keep on saying when I - now that I am back. We should be passing legislation that helps small businesses get credit, that eliminates capital gains taxes so that they have more incentive to invest right now. There are a whole host of measures we could take, no single element of which is a magic bullet but cumulatively can start continuing to build momentum for the recovery. But look, the - this was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the worst recession since the Great Depression. And so, what we know is that we are going to have to slowly, steadily build confidence. Push more investment out there. Target areas like clean energy that we know are going to be be growth areas in the future. Look at how we are doing our infrastructure, so that we can maximize the amount of jobs that are created. So, there - there are a range of steps that I hope we can get bipartisan support for. But right now, we are still - we are in the season, political season, which means that for the next two months there is going to be be constantly a contest in the minds of Members of Congress. And my Republican friends in Congress, between doing what the country needs and what they think may be advantageous in the - in terms of short term politics. Since you weighed into the Islamic Center near Ground Zero controversy, it - it is gotten larger. It is been nationalized, the debate. Will you revisit that topic? Well, look, I think my statement at the IFTAR dinner in the White House was very clear. And that is - is that if you can build a church on that site. If you can build a synagogue on that site or a Hindu Temple on that site, then we cannot treat people of the Islamic faith differently, who are Americans, who are American citizens. That is central to who we are. That is a core value of our Constitution. And my job as President is to make sure in part that we are upholding our Constitution. Respectfully, the next day in Florida, you seemed to walk that back. So - No, I - actually, let - let me be clear, Brian. I did not walk it back at all. The - what I said was I was not endorsing any particular project. I was endorsing our Constitution. And what is right. Now, the media, I think - anticipating that this was going to be be a firestorm politically - seemed to think that somehow there was inconsistency and there was not . And I was very specific to my team and will be very specific to you now. That the core value and principle that every American is treated the same. That does not change. I mean, think about it - I - at this IFTAR dinner I had - Muslim Americans who had been in uniform fighting in Iraq. Some of whom have served over 20 years. How - how can you say to them that somehow their religious faith is less worthy of respect under our Constitution and our system of government? You know, that is - that is something that I feel very strongly about. I respect the feelings on the other side. And I would defend their right to express them just as fiercely. ENTITY, you are an American born Christian. And yet, increasing and now significant numbers of Americans in polls, upwards of a fifth of respondents are claiming you are neither. A fifth of the people, just about, believe you are a Muslim. Keep in mind, those two things - American born and Muslim - are not the same. So - but I understand your point. Either or the latter, and the most recent number is the latter. This has to be troubling to you. This is, of course, all new territory for an American President. Well, look, the - the facts are the facts, right? So, we went through some of this during the campaign. You know, there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation, that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly. We dealt with this when I was first running for the U.S. Senate. We dealt with it when we were first running for the Presidency. There were those who said I could not win as U.S. Senator because I had a funny name. And people would be too unfamiliar with it. And yet, we ended up winning that Senate seat in Illinois because I trusted in the American people's capacity to get beyond all this nonsense and focus on is this somebody who cares about me and cares about my family and has a vision for the future? And so, I will always put my money on the American people. And I am not going to be worrying too much about whatever rumors are floating on - out there. If I spend all my time chasing after that then I would not get much done. Even a number as sizeable as this - what does it say to you? Does it say anything about your communications or the effectiveness of your opponents to - Well, look, Brian, I - I would say that I cannot spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead. It - it is what - the facts are the facts. And so, it is not something that I can I think spend all my time worrying about. And I do not think the American people want me to spend all my time worrying about it. What does it say to you that Glenn Beck was able to draw a crowd of perhaps north of 300,000 people on the anniversary of Dr. King's speech, on the site of Dr. King's speech? Message appeared to be, at times, anti-government, anti-spread of government. Anti-Obama administration. And in favor of - I guess - re-injecting God into both politics and the American discourse. Well, I have to say, I - I did not watch the rally. I think that one of the wonderful things about this country is that at any given moment any group of people can decide, you know, We want to - our voices heard. And - and so, I think that Mr. Beck and the rest of those folks were exercising their rights under our Constitution exactly as they should. I - I do think that it is important for us to recognize that right now, the country's going through a very difficult time, as a consequence of years of neglect in a whole range of areas. Our schools not working the way they need to, so we have slipped in terms of the number of college graduates, you know? A financial system that was not, you know, operating in a way that maintained integrity and assured that the people who were investing or who were buying a home or were using a credit card were not getting in some way cheated. We had a health care system that was broken and that was bankrupting families and businesses. All those issues are big, tough, difficult issues. And those are just our domestic issues. That is before we get to policy issues in two wars. And a continuing battle against terrorists who want to do us harm. So, given all those anxieties - and given the fact that, you know, in none of these situations are you going to be fix things overnight. It is not surprising that somebody like a Mr. Beck is able to stir up a certain portion of the country. That is been true throughout our history. What I am focused on is making sure that the decisions we are making now are going to be be not good for the nightly news. Not good even necessarily for the next election. But are good for the next generation. And I am very confident that those decisions are the ones that we have made. As you note it ties into an economy in down times. Do you have a message for the disenchanted? The angry? The angry who are unemployed and feeling victimized by this economy? Well, look, I think they have every right to be frustrated. And they have every right to be angry. And I think the message that I will continue to deliver in the months ahead and the years ahead is it took us a long time to get into this hole that we are in. This was the worst economic crisis that we have seen in generations. And we are making progress. We are steadily moving forward. A year ago today, we were still losing jobs, we are now gaining them. The economy was still contracting, it is not expanding. It is not happening as fast as people would like. But it is moving in the right direction. And the thing we cannot do is to try to go back to the same policies that created this mess in the first place. Now, part of the - I think the balance that we are going to be have to strike is the fact that, you know, we have got huge debt, huge deficits that amounted as a consequence of this financial crisis. A consequence of this incredibly deep recession. And that means that we are going to be have to do two things at once. We have got to keep on pushing to grow the economy. But we have also on the medium term and the long term have to get control of our deficit. And it would be ideal where we did not have to worry about one and could just focus on the other. But, you know, this generation, it is fallen on our shoulders to make some very tough decisions. The one thing I guess I would say to the American people is that we have been through tougher times before. And we always come out ahead. As long as we stay united. As long as we stay optimistic about the future. As long as we stay innovative. As long as we work hard and we apply ourselves. We have still got the best universities, the best workers, the best business climate of any economy in the world. And so, I have no doubt that we are going to be rebound and rebound strong. But when you are in the middle of it. And if you do not have a job right now. It is - it is a tough, tough situation. Finally, sir, because I see fidgeting - on Iraq. You are speaking on that subject this coming week. We watched the last of the combat troops leave live on on television. Our own Richard Engel wrote along with them. The end of Operation Iraqi Freedom. What would it take to send combat troops back in? A real and present threat to the 50,000 or so that remain in the so-called noncombat role would General Ordierno have to call you and say, We need more firepower back here. There were what? Fourteen coordinated bombings on one day. You know, Brian, I am not going to be speculate on what scenarios might occur. Here is what I know. The trend lines have been steadily declining violence. Even after we left the cities. What you have seen is lower and lower levels of violence. The Iraqi Security Forces are functioning at least as well if not better than any of us had anticipated. And there is great confidence on the part of the commanders on the ground. That even though you are going to be see some efforts at any given time for remnants of A.Q.I. and terrorist organizations to try to stir things up. That in fact you are not going to be see the kind of sectarian war break out in Iraq that had occurred. That does not mean that it is going to be be smooth sailing from here on out. That is why we have still got a training operation there. That is why we are going to be continue to conduct joint counterterrorism operations. That is why we have got to make sure that we have the troops there to protect our civilians who are really taking over the lead there. But the bottom line is - is that we have been able to successfully transition and turn over sovereignty and security operations to the Iraqis. Their job right now is to make sure that they get a government completed. And they are going through a political process that is natural in a fledgling democracy. But we are confident that that will get done. And that we are going to be be a long term partner within Iraq. But we are not going to be be operating in the same combat role that we have in the past. And finally, I am hoping to find you in a reflective mood on a cloudy day. We are the first to speak to you coming off your summer vacation. How does it recharge you? What do you think about? What do you see? What do you read about? How are you thinking about your job these days? You know, we went through the last two years of as intense a set of problems as I think any President's faced in a very long time. And I can look back and say we got some really tough stuff done that needed to get done. And as I look forward, my central focus is going to be be to make sure that I am constantly communicating with all segments of this country about why I feel optimistic about our future. You know, one of the - one of the actual great things about America as I was doing some - some - historical reading, during the break is we kind of go through these periods during difficult times where we think we are falling behind. You know, nothing's going right. We do a lot of soul searching. And then usually we come out of that funk and it is precisely because we do some self reflection. And we ask tough questions. And we have these contentious debates. And there is - you know - a lot of folks who have very strong opinions about various issues. That process helps guide us in a better direction. That is part of the reason why this is a more dynamic society than others. This is one that is adaptable. That can change. That can recover. That is resilient. And, you know, the one thing that I have never felt more confident about is that America will continue to lead the world, will continue to be resilient. And we are going to be just have to make sure that we stay steady and do not lose heart as we transition into a better future. And that means we are going to be have to make some tough choices now. But you know, we should - you know, we should constantly have our eye on - on that longer term price. What are you thinking about your jobs these days? Well, you know, I think that the first couple of years were, as I have said, about getting some very hard things done and contentious things done, but that needed to be done. I think the next couple of years, we have got to focus on debt and deficits. We have got to focus on making sure that we make the recovery stronger. And a lot of that is attracting private investment. Making sure that these companies who are making good profits are actually seeing the opportunities out there in a whole range of new areas and new ventures. So, there was a lot more implementation, management - probably less of the constant legislative functions that we had. But I - I am confident that both things are necessary. Both things are important. Enough work remaining to seek a second term out of. Well, you know, the - I - I am not spending a lot of time thinking about a second term. Right now, I am spending a lot of time thinking about what I got to do next week.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithbrianwilliamsnbcnightlynews", "title": "Barack Obama Interview With Brian Williams on NBC Nightly News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-brian-williams-nbc-nightly-news", "publication_date": "29-08-2010", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 253, "text": "Thank you for sitting down with us for a few minutes. We really appreciate it. Thank you. Yesterday you said in front of the DNC winter meeting, quote, Just in case there is any confusion out there, I am not going to walk away from health care. But specifically, how are you going to move forward? Well, what I have been doing is consulting closely with the leaders in the House, the leaders in the Senate, on the Democratic side, and I want to consult closely with our Republican colleagues. So they are going to be coming into the White House next week. And what I want to do is to ask them to put their ideas on the table. And then, after the recess, which will be a few weeks away, I want to come back and have a large meeting with Republicans and Democrats to go through systematically all the best ideas that are out there and move it forward. But part of the reason that people need to understand why we cannot back off on this, the major insurer one of the major insurers in California just announced that in the individual market they are increasing their premiums by 39 percent. That is a portrait of the future if we do not do something now. It is going to keep on beating down families, small businesses, large businesses. It is going to be a huge drain on the economy. We are going to have to do something about it, and I think we can. So you are inviting Republicans here to the White House. Does that mean, ENTITY, you are willing to start at square one? Well, I think that what I want to do is to look at the Republican ideas that are out there. And I want to be very specific. How do you guys want to lower costs? How do you guys intend to reform the insurance market so people with pre-existing conditions, for example, can get health care? How do you want to make sure that the 30 million people who do not have health insurance can get it? What are your ideas specifically? And if we can go step by step through a series of these issues and arrive at some agreements, then procedurally there is no reason why we cannot do it a lot faster than the process took last year. You say that jobs are your top priority this year. In retrospect, do you wish you had waited on health care until the economy grew stronger? No, because, keep in mind, jobs were my number one priority last year. That is why we passed the recovery act, to make sure that not only do we put $300 billion worth of tax cuts into people's pockets so that there was demand and businesses had customers. That is why we provided over $200 billion in assistance to states, so they would not have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters. And that all supported maintaining the jobs that we have. That is why we moved forward on infrastructure and clean energy and a lot of job creation. And having taken those steps very quickly at the front end, at the beginning of the year, it was important for us also to start looking at these issues that middle-class families have been struggling with for decades now. And do I wish we could have done it faster, that it had not been so painfully slow through the legislative process? Absolutely. But it was the right thing to do then. It continues to be the right thing. Speaking of the legislative process, when it comes to health care, people watched the sausage being made. Yeah. And, quite frankly, it made them pretty sick to their stomachs. Your White House was in the middle of all these negotiations, all these special deals that were given Well, I am not to certain senators. That is probably not a right characterization. But what is Well, you were aware of them. What is absolutely true is that getting something passed through Congress with 535 members is hard. It is especially hard in something as big as health care. It is going to be true when we try to get the financial reform so that we do not have the same kind of too-big-to-fail bailout nonsense that we had last year. Each of these issues are huge, complicated issues. There are tons of special interests and lobbyists up there. And each legislator, they think they are doing what is best for their state or for their district. And what we have to do is just make sure that it is a much more clear and transparent process. I have got to push Congress on that. We have got to make sure that we are watching out for that. But the end product, the actual agreements that were come to on health care, are ones that I am absolutely convinced benefit millions of people all across the country. But did some of these special deals, ENTITY, sort of They did not help. Get it passed at all costs turn your stomach too? They did not help. They frustrate me. But, you know, this is a democracy. Look, I would have loved nothing better than to simply come up with some very elegant academically approved approach to health care, and did not have any kinds of legislative fingerprints on it, and just go ahead and have that passed. But that is not how it works in our democracy. Unfortunately, what we end up having to do is to do a lot of negotiations with a lot of different people, many of whom have their best constituents' their constituents' best interests at heart. But cumulatively, what ends up happening is it ends up looking like each individual senator, each individual legislator, is just looking out for their own thing and do not have the larger public interest at heart. My job is to make sure that we stay focused on that larger vision of how do we lower costs for Americans over the long term. A lot of people, including Democrats, wrote to me saying you campaigned on the slogan Change you can believe in. But their lives and the ways of Washington, they wrote, have not changed at all. What would you say to them? Well, it is not true that they have not changed at all. Let us just take we are sitting in the White House here. Every single person who comes into the White House now is posted on a website, so you know every visitor to the White House. That is never happened in the history of the republic. We are eliminating lobbyists from boards and commissions that have significant power throughout Washington. That has not happened in a previous administration. There is more transparency on something like the recovery act and how taxpayer dollars are being spent than there is ever been on a project of this size and scale. So here in the White House, actually, we have instituted a whole range of changes that give people a lot more confidence in what we are doing. We have not done as much as needs to be done. So, for example, on earmarks, what people consider to be pork projects, what we have said is, Members of Congress, if you are going to introduce a project that benefits your district, you should post it on the Internet so people can see it before you vote on it, and we will put it on a centralized website. But all these things take time. I mean, you know, you are not going to transform a culture in Washington or anywhere else over the course of a year. You have just got to keep on chipping away at it. And that is what we have tried to do. Chris from Falls Church, Virginia writes, ENTITY, I lost my house two years ago and I have been out of work for a year. Can the federal government really stimulate the economy enough to start creating new jobs anytime soon? Without getting into too much policyspeak, what would you say to Chris? I'd say to Chris I know how tough it is been. I'd say that we are seeing the corner turn on the economy growing again. Last year at this time the economy had contracted, had shrunk by 6 percent. We know now that last quarter it had grown by 6 percent. That is a good sign that companies are starting to pick up hiring again, because they see the opportunities to go out there and make money. It is not happening as fast as we'd like, and that is why there are still some things we can do in terms of tax credits for small businesses, taking some of that TARP money that is been repaid and giving it to community banks so that they can lend it to small businesses, giving job credits to small businesses for hiring. Potentially a million small businesses out there could get $5,000 for each employee they hire this year. All those things, I think, are moving us in the right direction, and my hope is that for folks who are unemployed, they are going to start seeing concrete improvement in their own lives in the next few months. A cab driver told us to tell you he is scared to death of the deficit. And Congress could not even establish a bipartisan commission to study the deficit because Republicans were afraid it would raise taxes and Democrats were afraid it would cut spending. You can understand why people are not only afraid, but so frustrated. Well, it is important to remember that actually the majority of Democrats did vote to set up this commission. What happened was you had seven Republicans who had been co-sponsors of the bill who decided not to vote for it. And But some Democrats did not support it, correct? Well, no, of course. But think about this. You have got seven Republicans who are co-sponsors of the bill. It was their idea. And when I said, Yes, let us do it, suddenly they decided to say no. That is indicative of a lot of posturing on this issue. And what I think the American people want is just an honest assessment of the situation. Now, the honest assessment is this. We had a big structural deficit even before the recession. The recession made it much worse. We are not going to solve this overnight. And we do not want to either raise taxes or drastically slash government spending while the economy is still fragile. If Democrats and Republicans come together in a sensible way, putting everything on the table, not trying to position themselves politically ahead of time, then there is no reason why we cannot start putting in place some serious measures that will start driving the deficit down long term. The biggest thing, the most important thing that we can do on deficits and I would say this to your cab driver and everybody else is to get a health-reform package passed. The package that we put together, the Congressional Budget Office says, will cut the deficit by a trillion dollars. Even in Washington, that is real money. If we can start bending the cost curve on health care, that is the most important thing we can do to deal with the deficits long term. Have you ruled out trying confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York City? I have not ruled it out, but I think it is important for us to take into account the practical logistical issues involved. I mean, if you have got a city that is saying no and a police department that is saying no and a mayor that is saying no, that makes it difficult. But I think that the most important thing for the public to understand is we are not handling any of these cases any different than the Bush administration handled them all through 9/11. They prosecuted 190 folks in these Article III courts, got convictions, and those folks are in maximum-security prisons right now. And there have been no escapes. And it is a virtue of our system that we should be proud of. Now, what I have also said is that, you know, it is important for us to recognize that when we are dealing with al Qaeda operatives that they may have national-security intelligence that we need, and it is important to make sure that the processes and procedures we approach with respect to these folks are not identical to the ones that we would use if we are apprehending the local drug dealer. And that is why we put in place some very particular ways of dealing with these issues that ensure our security but also still uphold our due process. Are you talking about reading them the Miranda rights, their Miranda rights? Well, yeah In other words, like Abdulmutallab, who was read his Miranda rights? A lot of people are very upset about that because he was giving information to the FBI. Then his rights were read to him and he clammed up. Well, that is actually not what happened. What happened was he clammed up. And after we had obtained actionable intelligence from him, that is when the FBI the FBI folks on the ground then read him his Miranda rights. But keep in mind, Richard Reid was read his Miranda rights five minutes after he was arrested under the previous administration. Some of the same critics of our approach have been employing this policy for years. Having said that, should the practice of reading suspected terrorists their Miranda rights be reviewed? Absolutely. Everything should be reviewed. And what we have done is we have said let us have the best interrogators around. Some of those, by the way, are going to be FBI officials. Some of them are going to be police officers, who are very good at their jobs. Some of them are going to be national-security experts. Let us put together teams that are in charge of the interrogation process, because we want to make sure priority number one, when these kinds of events happen, have we gotten all the information we need to ensure that there is not going to be any additional attacks? But you have not ruled out New York City as a venue. We have not ruled out anything. We will make a definitive judgment based on consultations with all the relevant authorities. All right. And finally, a Super Bowl question. That is . I know you have said that you are rooting for the Saints a bit. You are impressed by what Drew Brees has done for New Orleans. But I am going to let you show off your sports knowledge for a moment. Who do you think will win, and why? You know, I think the Colts probably have to be favored, mainly because they have got perhaps the best quarterback in history. I mean, Peyton Manning is unbelievable. And, you know, they have got a team that has complete confidence in him. Everybody knows the system. There is enormous continuity with that team. So they are tough. I do have a soft spot in my heart for New Orleans, mainly because of what the city has gone through over these last several years, and I just know how much that team means to them. And I got to know Drew Brees when we shot a commercial for having kids get more active and get off the couch. And he is just a class act, terrific guy, wonderful family. But I would say that the Colts have to be favored. Now, one other factor that I have to confess here is that when my Bears went to the Super Bowl several years ago, it was the Indianapolis Colts that beat them, so I probably still have Ah, got an ax to grind. a little bit of an ax to grind. And you'd like to issue an executive order, I understand, mandating a close game. Mandating a close game. We had a great game last year. And I am hopeful that we have got the same kind of game we had with the Cardinals and the Steelers. All right, ENTITY, again, thanks so much for talking with us; appreciate it. Thank you.

{"id": 31, "text": "ENTITY, thank you for doing this. As we are walking towards your office I have to think you are going to miss this short commute. I am, it is one of the biggest benefits of being president that you really do not think about until you get here. I have never had to travel more than thirty seconds from home to office, and it is because of that that I have been able to maintain, you know, really a family life that has nurtured and sustained me during this time. How long did it take for the White House to feel like home though? You know, it, it took shorter, I think, for us, just because when you have got little kids, and you are tucking them in ? It is home. It is home, right? When you open a door and they are in their pajamas and they are , you know, wrestling with you and asking you, you know, to read to them and stuff, you know it starts feeling like home pretty quick. Not to mention having a mother-in-law upstairs, and the dog, and now two. It feels even more like home now because you have all these memories that were formed watching your kids grow up. You know you talk about the kids, and I know you all were pretty, a little bit apprehensive coming into the White House, they were young. Was it a good experience for them? You know, you do not know how it would have turned out if they'd grown up in Chicago instead, and a more normal environment. All I can say is they have turned out to be terrific young women. We were concerned mostly about whether they'd develop an attitude, right? How not, yeah. And they are, you know, sweet, kind, funny, smart, respectful people, and they treat everybody with respect. That is not just the biases of a parent. You know, we feel pretty good when we hear back from friends, cause they still have sleepovers and they go to other folks houses and when the parents say, oh you know, Malia, she is just so sweet, or Sasha helped to pick up the dishes, what is it that you are doing to ? They never complain about it? You know, they complained about Secret Service as they became teenagers, and Secret Service has done the very best job they could accommodating them, so it has not restricted any of their activities, but as you might imagine, if you are a teenager having a couple of people with microphones ? Always on your tail, yeah. and guns always following you around, that could grate on them. But you know, they have handled it with grace and I give Michelle most of the credit for how well they have done, but I also just think they are graceful, good young, young women. This part of the White House is so iconic. It is my favorite, yeah. This walk. It--it does not matter what time of day it is, in some ways I feel more attached to this walk even than the Oval Office. I believe it. Yeah. There is something about these steps and thinking about everybody who is walked here and all the business that is been done here. And business gets done on this walk. Yes, exactly. And even when you go up this ramp, and you think about FDR wheeling himself up, you know, got a little cigarette holder in his mouth, and it, that, that awe that you feel, that reverence that you feel for the place never entirely leaves. Well that is one of the things I was going ask you, because I know you kept in touch with people by reading those letters every day. Yes. How did you keep in touch with the presidency? It is an interesting question. I, more than anything, obviously the presidency is the people, and it is been interesting the emotions in the last few months. What you realize is that you may never have the team that is together in the same way, under the same pressures, and the attachments that you make to folks from your chief of staff down to ? It is the ultimate bunker. It is, and the people here have been extraordinary. We had a farewell dinner for some of my senior staff, and generally everybody likes to talk about how cool I was. I had trouble getting through just a few remarks, because not only do you appreciate the sacrifices they have made and the hours they have kept and the soccer games they missed and the birthday parties, but I also had a lot of young people who came in here, and this probably, you know, echoes with you, in your own experience, you were young when you got here. It did not feel like it when I left. Yeah, but you know, now suddenly you got members of your team who were 23, 24. They have met their wives here, or their husbands here. And you have a lot of eight year people. Yeah, and you, and they start bringing in their kids, who you think should be babies and now are in second grade or something, and you have watched them grow up. So I think what ends up happening is you end up maintaining those networks and those contacts, but the concentrated interactions and experience that you have here, I do not think, I do not expect you can duplicate anyplace else. We are about to walk into the Oval, and I was just wondering, the big gut-check decisions, did you make them in there or up in the Treaty Room at home? I think I made them on this walk sometimes. You know, there are times where I'd say the Oval Office, you use to gather the facts. The decisions you probably make late at night, or at least I do, I am kind of a night owl, up there. But there are some times where you think you have made a decision, but during that walk, where you are announcing the decision, you have just got to make sure that, you are prepared to live with it, because as you know George, a lot of these decisions are not-- the outcomes are uncertain. As you said, it is very busy, newsy day here, that shooting down in Fort Lauderdale this afternoon. Do we know enough now to know if it was an act of terror? As a general rule, until I have got all the information, George, I do not wanna comment on it other than just to say how heartbroken we are for the families who've been affected. These kinds of tragedies have happened too often during the eight years that I have been president. The pain, the grief, the shock that they must be going through is enormous. I have asked me staff to reach out to the mayor down there and make sure that coordination between the state and local officials is what it should be. But I think we will find out over the next 24 hours exactly how this happened and what motivated this individual. And also just a few minutes ago, this intelligence report came out on the Russian activities, declassified version. Pretty stark opening sentences. Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign. We further assess that Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-Elect Trump. President Putin was trying to elect Trump? Well, I think the report is very clear. Number one, the Russians sought to interfere with the election process-- that the cyber hacking that took place by the Russians was part of that campaign, and that they had a clear preference in terms of outcomes. What-- what I have repeatedly said is that you know, our intelligence communities spend a lot of time and effort gathering a lot of strands and a lot of data. There are times where they are very cautious and they say, We think this is what happened, but we are not certain. You are saying high confidence here-- The-- this time they have got high confidence, and having seen some of the underlying sources and information that they are basing this on I stand fully behind the-- the report. What does that tell you about what President Putin is trying to do right now? And I-- I think back to 2012 when Mitt Romney talked about Russia being the number one geostrategic threat, you kinda dismissed him in the second debate-- I did. Did you underestimate Vladimir Putin? You know, I do not think I underestimated him, but I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating. And so part of the reason that I ordered this report was not simply to re-litigate what happened over the last several months, but rather to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies. There are gonna be elections coming up among our NATO allies that we have to pay attention to. I anticipate that this kind of thing can happen again here. And so in addition to the report assessing what exactly happened, what we have also done is to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security and our intelligence teams are working with the various folks who run our elections. And one of the things that I have urged the president-elect to do is to develop a strong working relationship with the intelligence community and I think it is important that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, work with the next administration looking forward to make sure that this kind of influence is minimized-- He-- he met with the intelligence leaders this afternoon. Yeah-- Praised their work at the top. Still did not seem to accept their conclusions fully. He talked about Russia and China and-- and other countries. They made no assessment on whether this affected the outcome of the election. He said very clearly it had no effect on the outcome. What do you think? You know, I think there are a lot of factors going into an election. I think the bottom line is-- is that Donald Trump is gonna be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States of America. And it is not necessarily profitable to sort of try to untangle all the different factors that went into it. The issue here is you have I think the-- the clear example of how, if we are not vigilant foreign countries can have an impact on the political debate in the United States in ways that might not have been true 10, 20, 30 years ago in-- in part because of the way news is transmitted and in part because so many people are skeptical of mainstream news organizations that-- everything's true and everything's false. You know nothing-- nothing is-- is settled. Everything is contested. In that kind of environment, where there is so much skepticism about information that is coming in, we are gonna have to spend a lot more time thinking about how do we protect our democratic process and as I have been saying for years, we are gonna have to spend a lot more time on cyber security. That is one of the reasons why I'd ordered a commission-- But bottom line, this time Vladimir Putin got what he wanted. Well-- look, I-- I think that what is true is that the Russians intended to meddle, and they meddled. And it could be another country in the future. It could be another election where you know, the-- the alignments between Republicans and Democrats are different than they were this time and-and--who a foreign country prefers. And that is why I hope that this does not continue to be viewed purely through a partisan lens. I think there are Republicans as well as Democrats who are concerned about this. And the-- the two things we need to do, George-- number one, we have to spend a lot more time, energy, resources on cyber security. And it makes--what makes this difficult is because it is not just a government problem. It is a private sector and government problem. And there is gotta be a lot more cooperation. That was one of the key recommendations of this commissions that I got a report from just a few weeks ago. And the second thing we have to do is to make sure that all of us think about how we approach our elections and our democracy not only to secure them from vote tampering, but also to make sure that we understand when propaganda is being churned through the system. And-- and one of the things I-- I will be honest with you, George. One of the things that I am concerned about is the degree to which we have seen a lot of commentary lately where there were, there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seemed to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be. Does that include the president-elect? Well, what I will say is that--and I said this right after the election--we have to remind ourselves we are on the same team. Vladimir Putin's not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this country feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a threat to him, then we are gonna have bigger problems than just cyber hacking. You-- you have talked to the president-elect Trump now several times over the course of this transition. What have you tried to impress on him about the job? Well, as I have said before, the-- the conversations have been cordial. He has been open to suggestions, and the main thing that I have tried to transmit is that there is a different between governing and campaigning, so that what he has to appreciate is as soon as you walk into this office after you have been sworn in, you are now in charge of the largest organization on Earth. You cannot manage it the way you would manage a family business. You cannot manage it the way you would manage a Senate office. I-- I was a senator before I became president. And so you have to have a strong team around you. You have to have respect for institutions and the process to make good decisions because you are inherently reliant on other folks. So when I talked to him about-- our intelligence agencies, what I have said to him is-- is that there are gonna be times where you have got raw intelligence that comes in and in my experience, over eight years, the intelligence community is pretty good about saying, Look, we cannot say for certain what this means. But there are gonna be times where the only way you can make a good decision is if you have confidence that the process is working, and the people that you put in charge are giving you their very best assessments. How has he impressed you? You know, he is somebody who I think is very engaging and gregarious. Do you like him? You know, I have enjoyed the conversations that we have had. He is somebody who I think is not lacking in confidence, which is I think-- Some say that about you too. Well, that is what I was saying. It-- it is -- it is probably a prerequisite for the job, or at least you have to have enough craziness to think that you can do the job. I-- I think that he has not spent a lot of time sweating the details of, you know, all the policies that-- Does that worry you? Well, I think that can be both a strength and a weakness. I think it depends on how he approaches it. If he-- if it gives him fresh eyes, then that can be valuable. But it also requires you knowing what you do not know and putting in place people who do have the kinds of experience and background and-- and knowledge that can inform good decision making. And look, I-- I-- I think it is fair to say that he and I are-- are sort of opposites in some ways. Voters often do that, do not they? Yeah. Yeah. But so-- so let us say I am on the-- the policy wonk end of the spectrum. As much as I can dive into a briefing book and really work to-- to master various subjects that come before my desk, I am still not an expert on a huge amount of the stuff that we work on. But I do make sure that I have got people who are experts that are helping me make the best decisions possible. And if you do not have good people, and you do not have a good process and you do not have, at some level, the basic reverence for this office, and an understanding of the-- the incredible responsibilities and obligations, then, I think you can get into trouble. You are also not much of a tweeter. He was on a tirade this morning, sent out a lot of tweets early this morning. Clearly, according to him and his people, he is gonna keep on doing it when he is sitting there behind that desk. Good idea? On the one hand information is--is moving quick, and-- I-- I-- or-- or the way in which people consume information is changing so fast. Clearly this worked for him, and it gives him a direct connection to a lot of the people that voted for him. I-- in-- I have said to him, and I think others have said to him that the day that he is the President of the United States, there are world capitals and financial markets and people all around the world who take really seriously what he says, and in a way that is just not true before you are actually sworn in as president. People take seriously what you say as well. And during the campaign-- many of your speeches you say, All the progress we have made in the last eight years go out the window if we do not win. Still think that? No. I think that the-- the risk to all the progress we have made was at stake in the election because not just the president-elect but a lot of members of Congress, including now the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, have said that their principal agenda was to undo a lot of this progress. But as I have been talking about over the last several days when it comes to health care, the gains that we have made are there. Twenty million people have health insurance that did not have it before. The uninsured rate is the lowest it is ever been. The rise in health care costs since Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act was passed, have been at their lowest rate in 50 years. Those savings have extended the Medicare trust fund by 11 years. So we-- we have got-- we have got a baseline of facts. Here-- here-- here is -- here is where we were, here is where we are now. So it is true theoretically that all that progress can be undone, and suddenly 20 million people or more do not have health insurance. But as I think Republicans now are recognizing that is -- may not be what the American people, including even Trump voters, are looking for. And my hope is that the president-elect, members of Congress from both parties look at, Where have we objectively made progress, where things are working better? Do not undo things just because I did them. I do not have pride of authorship. I said today in a forum on health care if the Republicans can come up with a system that insures more people cheaper, better I will be the first one-- And I can tell by your smile you do not think they can do it? Well, I am skeptical that they can do it mainly because for seven years now, including when we first tried to pass health care, I said to 'em, Okay, if-- if this does not work tell me what does. In this room I remember having meetings with Republican senators who initially had been trying to engage but saw that the politics of 'no' were growing inside the Republican Party. And I remember having a conversation in the Oval Office with one of those senators who was-- was starting to get a little sheepish about what compromises might-- garner his support. And finally I asked him, Is there any changes I could make that would get you to support this? And he said, Probably not, ENTITY, which was a nice change in terms of just candor. But what-- what that means then is, is that now the burden is to take a look. All right, if-- if-- if-- if you think that we have overregulated in the environmental space what I can show you is that we have tripled the amount of wind power in this country, increased by tenfold the amount of solar power. We are producing as much oil and gas as we have ever produced. Gas is at two bucks a gallon. Utility rates and electricity rates are low. So you will, it seems like the energy policy we got right now is working pretty good. If you think you got a better idea in terms of how to approach this that is not gonna result in more pollution, and more asthma, and more illness then put your ideas out there. But do not just oppose things because, This was Obama's agenda. Sounds like that is what is happening right now. Well, that is what is happening at the moment. But you know, the American people-- are-- are both anxious for change. We are in a time of-- of flux. You know, the-- the globe is shrinking, the inform age-- information age is-- is bringing a lot of changes. People are anxious about their future and their children's futures. But they do not want folks to be reckless and they do not want this town to just be tit-for-tat. And-- you know, one of the gratifying things, I think, about the end of my presidency-- even though admittedly-- my successor ran against a lot of what we stood for, is when you look at the individual issues and the progress that we have made on a lot of those issues, we got the support of a pretty decent majority. Even on health care what you have seen is a lot of stories surfacing lately about people who said, Well, I voted for Trump but I do not think he is really gonna take away my health care-- So is Obamacare gonna survive? I think it will. Or-- it may be called something else. And-- and as I said I do not -- I do not mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they would not cooperate because they did not wanna-- make the system work, and re-label it as Trumpcare, I am fine with that. Because what I am thinking about are the millions of people, many of whom write me very personal letters-- Dear ENTITY, I did not vote for you. I was against Obamacare. And then my son who did not have health insurance signed up and we just found out that he had an illness. And thankfully he is now covered, otherwise he might not have gotten treatment and I might have lost my house. Dear ENTITY, You know, my husband got hooked on opioids and thank God we have coverage and were able to access substance abuse. He is clean now, he is gone back to work. You have people around the country who are benefitting from the steps that we have taken and as long as they continue to get helped, then at least I will know in my own mind that the work we did here had a lasting impact. You have often said that your toughest day in office was the day of the Newtown shootings. What was your toughest decision? Toughest decision was early in my presidency when I ordered 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan. As somebody who had run to end a large troop presence overseas. Now, I had said from the start that I thought Iraq was a mistake, that we should have stayed focused on Afghanistan. I think it was the right decision because the Taliban at that point had gotten a lot of momentum before I'd gotten into office, partly because we had not been paying attention as much as we needed to to Afghanistan. And since that time we have been able to build up the Afghan security forces and stabilize it. But that was the first time in which I looked out at a crowd of West Point graduates and knew that some of those might not come back because of-- because of that decision-- How disappointing --then how disappointing is it to you that even though it is far fewer, there would still be troops in Afghanistan, still be troops in Iraq as you leave? Yeah. Well, one of the things that I have learned, and I think we have all learned, is that we are not going to get the kind of decisive, permanent victories in this fight against terrorism that we would get from fighting another country. We are not going to get that MacArthur/Emperor moment, because by definition, even after decimating Al Qaeda in the Fata, even after taking out bin Laden there is still people there who have both the--the interest and the capacity if we do not maintain vigilance to strike against the United States. And these are still countries that are fragile enough that we are gonna have to partner with them in some way. But what we have done, I think, is build a model from a lot of hard lessons in Afghanistan and Iraq-- but in other places around the world, where we are working with them in an advisory capacity. It still puts burden on some troops of ours who are there as advisors and facilitators. But we do not have this huge footprint, we are less likely to be targeted as, you know, occupiers. And if you look at the current Mosul campaign again-- against ISIL, for example the-- the few thousand troops that we have there to support that effort allows the Iraqi military to move forward in an effective way. Now, would they do it as fast as if we had 50,000 or 100,000 Marines in there? Obviously not. But it does give us the ability to make sure that we are strengthening those folk who are interested in building up their countries rather than destroying them, and doing so in a way that is sustainable and does not put a constant burden on the amazing men and women that we have got in uniform. What has to be a disappointment on the home front is that-- it looks like the Democratic Party got pretty hollowed out on your watch, about 1,000 seats lost in the Congress, Senate, governors, state houses. Is that on you? I take some responsibility on that. I-- I think that some of it was circumstances. If you look at-- what happened, I came in in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And unlike FDR who waited-- well, did not take office until about three years into the Great Depression, it was happening just as I was elected. I think we did a really good job in saving this economy and putting us back on the track of growth. But what that meant is in 2010 there were a lot of folks who were still out of work. There were a lot of folks who had lost their homes or saw their home values plummet, their 401k's plummet. And we were just at the beginnings of a recovery. And the, you know, whoever is president at that point is gonna get hit and his party's gonna get hit. That then means that suddenly you have got a redistricting in which a lot of state legislatures are now Republican. They draw lines that give a huge structural advantage in subsequent elections. So-- so some of this was circumstances. But what I think that what is also true is that partly because my docket was really full here, so I could not be both chief organizer of the Democratic Party and function as Commander-in-Chief and President of the United States. We did not begin what I think needs to happen over the long haul, and that is rebuild the Democratic Party at the ground level. Part of your job now? Well, I think that it is something that I have an interest in. As-- as you know, George, my entire career, I started as a community organizer. Every one of my campaigns was premised on getting new people involved. And if there is a theme in my public career it is that if ordinary people get involved then good things happen. So I want to see the Democratic Party move in that direction. And what that means is that we are not just micro-targeting to eke out presidential victories; it means that we are showing up in places where right now we are not winning a lot. And if you look at sort of how politics has divided itself here in this country, the big divide right now is between urban areas, which have become increasingly Democratic, and rural or exurban areas that feel as if they are being ignored. And if Democrats are not showing up in those places, even if you-- even if you are not gonna win right away but if you are not in there at least making an argument that, Hey, you know what? It is the Democrats who are trying to raise your minimum wage. It is the Democrats who are trying to make sure you got health care or that your health care costs are not killing ya. It is Democrats who were making sure that your kids are not drinking polluted water. It is Democrats who are trying to reign in the banks if they engage in excesses so that you do not end up having a problem. If we are not there making the argument then the-- the cultural gulf that Republicans try to exploit saying, Ah, these city slickers: they are all looking down on you, they do not care about you. They are just trying to help out their various special interest constituencies, that argument ends up being successful. And so we have got to do a better job of showing up. And I was able to do that when I was the candidate. But I have not-- I have not seen or-- or presided over that kind of systematic outreach that I think needs to happen. This is JFK's desk, right? Yeah. He used it. Famous story about him: Clare Booth Luce, the diplomat, former Congresswoman goes to him in 1962. He asks her, What is on your mind? She says, The greater the man, the easier it is to describe him in a single sentence. And she said to him, What is your sentence? What is your sentence? What was JFK's answer? I do not care what history thinks. I am sure he did. I'd like to think that-- maybe the sentence is-- President Obama believed deeply in this democracy and the American people. Because-- as I reflect back on what is worked for me in this office it is been that I have -- I have gotten people who maybe did not believe in the process to get engaged. Ironically, I have even gotten the other side that maybe did not believe in the process to get engaged. I, you know, I-- I-- I am -- I gather I am the-- the father of the Tea Party. I-- I invigorated the grassroots in the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party. So, you know, I-- if-- health care got done because there were a lot of people out there who are not professional politicians, but are citizens, who pushed for it even when the politics was hard. But did you succeed on your own terms? Back in the campaign you talked about Ronald Reagan changing the trajectory of the country, setting on a fundamentally different path. Do you think you did that? I think I did in the sense that there is a whole generation coming up behind us that was engaged, inspired, worked for change during the course of my presidency, saw what was possible. And that-- that-- that generation, it is coming. They are not the majority yet but they are gonna be the majority soon. And when you look at what they believe in, when they, you look at how they value diversity, how they believe in science, how they care about the environment, how they believe in, you know, everybody getting a fair shot, how they believe in not discriminating against people for sexual orientation and you know, their belief that we have to work with other countries to create a more peaceful world and-- and to alleviate poverty, that is the majority of-- of an entire generation that is coming up behind us. They did not come out to vote? Well, you know, they came out to vote for me. And they came out to vote where that-- spirit was touched. The next phase and this is part of what I am interested in doing after I get out of the presidency is to make sure that I am working with that next generation so that they understand you cannot just rely on inspiration. There is a little perspiration involved in bringing about change too. That you have to be organized, that you have to vote even when it is not exciting. You have to be involved during midterm elections, you have to care about what happens at a school board level. You have to be involved in terms of what is happening in your local neighborhood and what issues are there. So-- so I think that there is gonna be a lot of work to do in order to consolidate the transformations that I was interested in. But I--but the spirit's there and-- and that is not just my imagination. I think if you look at surveys and attitudes among young people, you see it. I imagine you think the presidency's something you get better at over time? You do. But at what point does the experience become a liability? And what put this in my mind was reading Bob Gates' memoir. And he talks about being in the meetings with you and talking about the raid on Osama bin Laden, saying, Maybe he is getting too cautious; he is been there too long. Is that a risk? Well, what I will say is this: I believe in term limits for presidents because I think that there is no doubt I am a better president now than I was when I start. In fact, I-- I would argue that I-- I am the best president I have ever been over the last year or-- or two. My team is more effective than it is ever been. But what is also true is that number one, this is grueling. And sustaining the energy and focus involved in doing a good job I think starts to-- starts to gets tougher the longer you do it. The second thing is, the bubble's the bubble. And-- and I think we have done a pretty good job staying in touch with the American people. But at a certain point you cannot help but lose some feel for what is on the ground because you are not on the ground and-- and-- You did not think Donald Trump could win? Case in point. So-- so that tells me that there is-- there-- there is a utility in the democracy refreshing itself on an ongoing basis. And-- and that is part of what I tried to describe to my team and supporters after the election, there was a lot of disappointment. You know, I--what I have said to them is, Look, we-- we ran our leg of the race and we did a darn good job. I can document-- in fact, this past week we are -- we have put out memos from every agency showing what did we do. Try to be as honest as possible. There is a little hype involved obviously. It is spin because it is our agencies. We-- we feel some pride about it. But tried to be self-critical as well. And-- and I can honestly say, George-- and I do not think there is a lot of dispute for this. You-- you can argue that we did not get everything done that we wanted to get done, but I can make a really strong argument, and I think prove, that by almost every measure the country's better off now than when I started. W-- And so just to finish the thought, what that means then is that if we started here and we are now here, just like I described in health care, yeah, somebody comes in, they got new ideas, maybe ideas that are completely opposite of my ideas. Maybe some of it goes, maybe some of that progress goes back. Maybe they think of some things we did not think of, and so in some other areas-- we can learn something. But that just gives sort of the democracy an opportunity to test ideas, for those who lost to catch their breath, regain energy, reenergize themselves and then get back in the arena, and then we will make some more progress in the future. One-- one possible big exception: In the first line of your biography it is probably going to be first African-American president. Yeah. The heart of your promise when you first burst on the national scene, bringing everyone together. And you look now and most African-Americans think we have gone backwards on race relations over the last eight years. What do you say to that? I-- I am absolutely convinced that race relations on the whole are actually better now than they were 20 years-- Better now? Yes. But we have greater awareness of where we are falling short than we used to. Let us just take the example of-- community police relations. I mean, the truth of the matter is that-- that the problem of police shootings and reactions in the community-- George, you and I are about the same age. I-- I think you remember what happened in Los Angeles after Rodney King, I think you remember what-- the divisions that happened after the O.J. trial. I think you -- the-- the notion that somehow any of that is new is not the case. What is true, though, is now we have got a bunch of videos that whatever side of the issue you are on, raises the temperature on these issues and makes people really focused and-- and-- and-- and trying to figure out, What exactly is this? And I think that is a healthy thing. But I also-- I am not so out of touch that I do not see how young people interact today. And what is -- That horrific Facebook Live video yesterday-- And, well, it was horrific. And that is an example of something that it is not as if that is the first time that a hate crime has taken place in this country. Hate crimes have been taking place for hundreds of years in this country, but it is there on video. And the-- the-- the sort of seeing cruelty and callousness of that sort from young people is heartbreaking. And so naturally if you see a video like that you are gonna say to yourself, My God, this is horrible, and-- and rightfully so. But that allows us then to talk about how-- how-- how do we break free from those kinds of attitudes? And I think that we are in a position to continue to make progress, but it is gonna require us to both recognize what the problems are, also recognize the-- the-- the progress we have made. Last point I'd make on this, since we are on criminal justice: During the course of my presidency crime has been the lowest it is been probably since the '60s. But you would not know it if you were watching TV or looking at the internet, and you certainly would not know it, listening to this past campaign. There are some exceptions: Chicago, my hometown, in particular. But overall in the country this is a much safer place than it used to be. But if you ask the average person they'd tell ya, Naw, it is much more dangerous, despite the fact that violent crime has dropped precipitously. And so we have to recognize we have got some big problems on race, just like we got still big problems on crime, just like we got big problems on just about everything. But we also have to make sure that we have -- draw confidence from the progress that we have made, 'cause otherwise, you get into this cycle of cynicism. And you are also-- and I warn young people that I interact with about this-- you get into unrealistic expectations where you think that, Oh, we are gonna eliminate racism like that. After Obama's elected how could there be any racism? Well, you know, that-- that-- that was never a realistic expectation. I have one final question. I have a very strong memory of your inaugural. In that moment you are walking out of the Capitol, you see them all for the first time and you kind of pause and take it all in. Do you remember what you were thinking and feeling at that moment? The two inaugurations were different. The first inauguration I was thinking to myself, Let us make sure I do not screw this up. I think there is-- people always talk about how cool I am. I do not care how cool you are. JFK gave probably the greatest inauguration speech ever that first time, but I guarantee you when he first walked out there he was thinking, Goodness gracious this is-- this is-- this is big and I better be up to the task. I think the second inauguration you may recall I-- I finished my speech- You turned around-- --I was walking out and I decided, You know what? Let me turn back and-- and remember this. And-- and what I remember thinking at that point, having gone through both the ups and downs of my first four years, and seeing the sea of people was, What a remarkable country this is and how lucky am I that-- that we live in a place where the son of a single mom, not born into any kind of fame or fortune, in a pretty remote state somehow can end up be in a position to-- to make a difference. And at that moment, just a little under two weeks from now, when President-elect Trump finishes the oath, power passes from you to him, what emotion will you be left with? It is hard to say. It is hard to anticipate. I can tell you what I am feeling right now is that I am busier than I expected these last two weeks. A great deal of emotion around the people that I have worked with and the gratitude I feel for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of the American people, but also on behalf of me personally. And I think I will still feel that same appreciation for what Churchill and others have said is the worst form of government except all the alternatives. ENTITY, thank you very much. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgeorgestephanopoulosabcnewsthisweek15", "title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News' This Week", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-this-week-15", "publication_date": "08-01-2017", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 61, "text": "ENTITY, thanks for talking with us. Thank you so much for being here. Did you or anyone else in your administration tell Tom Daschle he had to step down as your nominee? Well, you know, I am not going to go into the details of it as has been reported, Tom made the decision that he was going to be too much of a distraction to carry out what he is so passionate about, which is health care reform. What I did tell him was that I take responsibility for this mistake, I mean, I think that Tom took responsibility for the mistake on his taxes. I think it was an honest mistake, and I made the assessment, I made the judgment that he was the best person to achieve health care reform and bring people together, but what became clear to me is that we cannot send a message to the American people that we have got two sets of rules, one for prominent people and one for ordinary people and, you know, so I consider this a mistake on my part and one that I intend to fix and correct and make sure that we are not screwing up again. Well, the reason I ask is because yesterday in this office you were asked whether you supported him and you said, absolutely. Yeah. And it becomes clear from your answer that you played a role in the decision for him -- No, no, no, no. I do not want to misstate the issue here. Tom made the decision here. He called me and indicated this was his decision. Would you have continued to back him? Well, I do not want to get into hypotheticals, ENTITY. Here is what I will say. I think Tom is an outstanding person. I think this was an unintentional mistake on his part, but a substantial one and there is no excuse for the mistake. He took responsibility for it. Ultimately, I have to take responsibility for a process that resulted in us not having an HHS Secretary at a time when people need relief on their health care costs, and so, you know, this is a mistake, probably not the first one I am going to be making in this office, but what I am absolutely committed to doing is fixing it, getting a highly qualified HHS Secretary and then making sure that we start providing some health care relief to families who so desperately need it. On your first day in office, you signed an executive order on lobbyists. Right. That you said marks a, quote, clean break with business as usual, and yet in less than two weeks, you have signed waivers to allow the hiring of lobbyists to be Deputy Secretary at the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary at HHS and Chief of Staff at the Treasury. Is that a clean break? Well, that is three out of hundreds of appointments that we have made. But it is three of the top jobs in three really important departments -- But let me say this, ENTITY. We disclosed these ahead of time. We set a very high bar and everybody acknowledges that we have the toughest standards, not only of people who have lobbyists previously and the restrictions on them working in this White House, but also going forward and those rules will still apply. Let us turn to the economic stimulus plan and the bottom line question. Yeah. Will it work? You are taking hits right now from all sides, right and left. Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs calls it a, quote, astounding mishmash of tax cuts, public investments, transfer payments and special treats for insiders. Why not just pull it back, forget about the February 16th deadline and get it right? Well, I think, actually, that we are closer to getting it right than all these critics, partly because all these critics -- Alice Rivlin from the left, Martin Feldstein from the right. Hold on a second, ENTITY, you want me to answer your questions -- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It turns out that all these critics have contradictory suggestions, do not they? Some of them are saying, well, it does not spend out fast enough except it turns out that they also want infrastructure projects that might last for four or five or six years. There is no magic bullet to these situations. Here is what this package does. It provides payments like unemployment insurance to people who've lost their jobs and are in desperate need of help and every economist says that that is a smart thing to do because that gets the money out right away. It provides support for people who've lost their health care because they have lost their jobs, and I think that is the right thing to do for families. It also invests in green technologies, infrastructure, that will lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth and most of the criticisms that have been leveled and that you have heard on your show about various pet projects that members of Congress might have put in there, when you tally all those up amount to less than one percent of the entire package. The last point I'd make is that many of the critics what they are calling for are more tax cuts, when, in fact, this is already $300 billion worth of tax cuts and many of the people on the other side of the debate consider many of those wasteful, but you know, I actually think that Mitch McConnell is right, that we should have some tax cuts in this package. This is not going to be a package that makes everybody happy, but the main criteria I have is it going to put people back to work? And I think it actually will. Is the February 16th deadline firm? Yes, because nobody disagrees with the idea that if we keep on putting this off that we are going to end up seeing more months with half a million people losing their jobs each month. We cannot afford to wait. You reportedly told Senate Democratic leaders when you met with them yesterday that you want some changes in the bill. So let us do if we can, sir, I used to do this with you as a candidate, but I am going to ask you as ENTITY to do a lightning round of quick questions and answers about specific changes, tax credits for people who buy homes or businesses, good or bad? I think it has some potential and I am willing to take a look at it. Federally guaranteed lower mortgage rates? Our intention has always been that in addition to this recovery and reinvestment package that we are also going to have a housing bill, that we have also got to fix the banking system, that we are going to have to make sure that, for example, issues like executive compensation for banks that are getting money through the TARP that that is dealt with. I actually agree with Democrats and Republicans that we have got to do more to provide relief to homeowners to prevent foreclosure. Strip out by the Buy American provision for steel and iron in the bill, which a number of our allies are saying is too protectionist. I agree that we cannot send a protectionist message. I want to see what kind of language we can work on this issue. I think it would be a mistake though at a time when worldwide trade is declining for us to start sending a message that somehow we are just looking after ourselves and not concerned with world trade. Since you became ENTITY, you have warned Republicans, quote, You cannot just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done. Now, how do you know that is a quote? Well, I read it in the media. Yeah. Did you not say anything about Rush Limbaugh? Well, you know, I just want to -- I am not sure that was the exact quote. All right. Let me throw another one at you. All right. And you tell me whether this was an exact quote. You were widely quoted when you met with the House GOP Caucus saying, Go ahead, feel free to whack me, I will watch Fox News and feel bad about myself. That one I did say. Perhaps, let me just raise the possibility -- Yeah. Are you a trifle thinned-skin? No, no, no, I said it in good humor. I think everybody understood that that was a joke. No, I think, ENTITY, it is fair to say that I do not always get my most favorable coverage on Fox, but I think that is part of how democracy is supposed to work, you know, we are not supposed to all be in lockstep here and you have always been very gracious to me. And if that improves or hurts or my stock at Fox, but thank you. It may hurt it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithchriswallacefoxnews", "title": "Interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-chris-wallace-fox-news", "publication_date": "03-02-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 540, "text": "Good evening, Mr. ENTITY. On behalf of all my colleagues present here and of the truly nationwide audience, I would like to thank you, first of all, for having agreed to do this interview. I understand that you have prepared a statement for the Japanese people that perhaps you would like to make right now. Please, Mr. ENTITY. Well, thank you very much. And may I say how delighted Nancy and I are to be back in Japan. The last time we visited Japan was 1978 at the invitation of one of your Diet Members, Shintaro Ishihara. I was also here in 1971, when I had the pleasure of seeing Kyoto, your beautiful, ancient capital city. There is so much in Japan's history and culture that impresses us. Americans are full of admiration for the Japanese people, the warmth of your ways, your spirit of initiative and teamwork, and your strong traditions of devotion to family, education, and progress. You have brought great development and prosperity to your country. We know that the struggle for better living was often difficult in earlier days. But endurance, tenacity, and sheer hard work-qualities which I understand are beautifully portrayed in your popular TV drama, Oshin -have brought your nation great economic success. Recently I received a letter from Masayasu Okumura, principal of the Nishisawa School in Akita Prefecture, which I understand is very far from Tokyo. Mr. Okumura invited Nancy and me to visit his country school and his 27 students. Mr. Okumura, I wanted to drop in on your school and talk with your students, but our stay in Japan this week has been too short. We wish we had time to meet more people and see more of your beautiful country, including such places as Kyoto, Hokkaido, Hiroshima, Nara, and Nagasaki. But we depart tomorrow, confident that our relations are strong and good. As I have said to the Diet today, we may live thousands of miles apart, but we are neighbors, friends, and partners, bound by a community of interests and shared values. Michitaro Matsusaki, one of Japan's earlier diplomats, said to Commodore Perry in 1854 what millions of us feel today: Japan and America, all the same heart. Our countries enjoy great prosperity. We live in free and open societies. But much of the world lives in poverty, dominated by dictators unwilling to let people live in peace and freedom. That is why our relationship is so important. Japan and America shoulder global responsibilities, but with every responsibility comes opportunity. We can share with the world our secrets of economic growth and human progress. We can offer the sunlight of democracy to people everywhere who dream of escaping the darkness of tyranny to decide their own destinies. Japan and America are nations of the future, builders of tomorrow, and together we can build a brighter tomorrow. We can make this world a much safer, more secure, and prosperous place. I know with all my heart that if we have faith to believe in each other, to trust in the talent and goodness of the hard-working people in our great cities and small towns, then, yes, we will make our partnership grow, and together there is nothing Japan and America cannot do. And now, I'd be delighted to answer some questions that you may have for me. Thank you very much, Mr. ENTITY. Mr. ENTITY, listening to your statement, like many other people I find that you are indeed a great communicator. I say this not because you said very kind words about our famous city of drama, but because I think that your personal style on television is more relaxed and informal than that of many other politicians. That is why, with your approval, Mr. ENTITY, I would like to conduct this interview in a very informal way so that the Japanese people can get a clearer view of your personality. Since your arrival, Mr. ENTITY, Japanese people have been following very closely your visit. And yesterday we saw that you enjoyed a lot about our demonstration of Yabusame at Meiji Shrine. What did you think of that typical traditional Japanese sport? And if I may ask, apart from horse riding, what are your personal hobbies, Mr. ENTITY? Well, horseback riding is certainly one, and all the things that go with having a ranch. I do a lot of the work whenever I have the opportunity to get there that has to be done around a ranch. As a matter of fact, just this summer we had a number of days at the ranch, and I managed to build, with the help of two friends, build about 400 more feet of fence that we built out of telephone poles. And it can get a little back breaking, but I enjoy that. Someone once asked me when I was ever going to have the ranch finished, and I said I hope never, because I enjoy that. But there are other things, of course. I enjoy reading. I enjoy athletics of other kinds. And now, thanks to the generosity of your Prime Minister since his last visit there-while I do not get to play golf very often, I will now be playing it with a brand new set of golf clubs which he presented to me. Well, you have now completed almost all the events of your very full schedule for Japan. Yesterday you gave us your official view of the visit, but I wonder if you could give us now a more personal view of this visit? Well, yes, I am very pleased with what has taken place here. First of all the warmth of the reception from all your people, and I mean not just the people of diplomacy and government that I had dealings with, but your people there on the streets and their showing of hospitality and friendship has been very heartwarming. But I have always believed that we only get in trouble when we are talking about each other instead of to each other. And since we have had an opportunity here to not only speak with your Diet but then to meet with your Prime Minister and others-and, of course, I have been greatly honored to have been received by His Imperial Majesty, your Emperor-I think that we have established a human kind of bond, not just one that is framed in diplomacy, but an understanding of each other as people. And I think that the world needs more of this. Mr. ENTITY, I would like you to know, in the first place, that many of my compatriots will be surprised and very happily so at the inclusion of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the list of the places that you'd like to visit or you wish you could visit. And to this end, of course, you will have to be a young sagacious man so that you will be able to fulfill your and our common desire in this regard. Now, are you going to be one? Are you going to be a sagacious man? Well, I am certainly going to try. This is too dangerous a world to just be careless with words or deeds. And if ever there was a need for the world to work toward peace and to work out of the dangerous situation that we are in, that time is now. On a more, a little more serious note, Mr. ENTITY, my question is exactly related to this point. And that is, because of the experience that we in Japan went through, we are very genuine in hoping even for a very minimum, limited progress in the arms control talks which are currently underway. And just as it took another Republican ENTITY with very conservative credentials to effect a rapprochement very successfully with China, there are Japanese who hope that, perhaps, your hard-line policy may lead to the relaxation of East-West tensions. And in light of these hopes and expectations, Mr. ENTITY, could you comment on these talks? And, also, I would appreciate it a great deal if you would give us your assessment of the current state of and, perhaps, future prospects for U.S.-Soviet relations, particularly in the arms control area. Well, now, if all of your question-you prefaced it with remarks about the People's Republic of China. Yes, we are working very hard to improve relations there and establish trust and friendship. And I think we have made great progress. I know there is a question that is raised sometimes with regard to our friends on Taiwan-the Republic of China. And I have to say, there, that I have repeatedly said to the leaders of the People's Republic of China that they must understand that we will not throw over one friend in order to make another. And I would think that that would be reassuring to them, that they, then, might not be thrown over at some time in the future. But with regard to the Soviet Union-and you mentioned my hard line. And that is-I know I am described that way a great deal. What is being called a hard line, I think, is realism. I had some experience with Communists-not of the Soviet kind, but domestic, in our own country, some years ago when I was ENTITY of a labor union there. And I feel that we have to be realistic with the Soviet Union. It is not good for us, as some in the past have, to think, well, they are just like us and surely we can appeal to, say, their kindliness or their better nature. No. I think they are very materialistic. They are very realistic. They have some aggressive and expansionist aims in the world. And I believe that, yes, you can negotiate with them; yes, you can talk to them. But it must be on the basis of recognizing them as the way they are and then presenting the proposals in such a way that they can see that it is to their advantage to be less hostile in the world and to try and get along with the rest of the nations of the world. And if this is hard-line, then I am hard-line. But it is important because of, also, your opening remarks with reference to the great nuclear forces in the world. We are going to stay at that negotiating table. We will not walk away from it. We are going to stay there trying, not as we have in the past to set some limits or ceilings on how many more missiles would be built, how much more growth they could take in those weapons, we want a reduction in the numbers. But really and practically, when we start down that road, and if we can get cooperation from them in reducing them, we should then continue down that road to their total elimination. Many years ago, after he became ENTITY, Dwight Eisenhower, as ENTITY, wrote a letter to a noted publisher in our country. And he said in that letter that we had to face the fact that weapons were being developed in which we could no longer see a war that would end in victory or defeat as we had always known it. But the weapons were such that it would end in the destruction of human kind. And, as he said, when we reach that moment, then let us have the intelligence to sit down at a table and negotiate our problems before we destroy the world. I see it also in another way that he did not mention. Once upon a time, we had rules of warfare. War is an ugly thing, but we had rules in which we made sure that soldiers fought soldiers, but they did not victimize civilians. That was civilized. Today we have lost something of civilization in that the very weapons we are talking about are designed to destroy civilians by the millions. And let us at least get back to where we once were-that if we talk war at all, we talk it in a way in which there could be victory or defeat and in which civilians have some measure of protection. Thank you very much, Mr. ENTITY. Mr. ENTITY, you referred to the current situation as being very dangerous. And in recent months we have witnessed one act of violence after another-the assassination of Mr. Aquino in the Philippines, and the shooting down of the Korean Airlines passenger jet, the terrorist bombing in Rangoon, and again in the bombing in Lebanon, Beirut, and the regional conflicts that persist at many different parts of the world, including the Middle East and the Caribbean. I think we certainly live in a very dangerous world, and your administration has advocated very strongly for building more effective defense capabilities of the United States and of its allies. Now my question is, Mr. ENTITY, my question is that the kind of danger that the world faces today would be minimized if the United States and its partners, including Japan, become stronger militarily? Yes, and this is part of that realism that I meant. I once did a lot of negotiating across a table as a labor leader on behalf of a union, and I think I know and understand the give and take of negotiations. But for a number of years now, recently, we have sat at the table in meetings with the Soviet leaders who have engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of mankind. And they sat on their side of the table looking at us and knowing that unilaterally we were disarming without getting anything in return. They did not have to give up anything. They saw themselves get stronger in relation to all of us as we, ourselves, made ourselves weaker. I think realistically to negotiate arms reductions they have to see that there is a choice. Either they join in those arms reductions, or they then have to face the fact that we are going to turn our industrial might to building the strength that would be needed to deter them from ever starting a war. Wars do not start because a nation is-they do not start them when they are weak; they start them when they think they are stronger than someone else. And it is very dangerous to let them see that they have a great margin of superiority over the rest of us. There is nothing to prevent them from then becoming aggressive and starting a war. Now, if they know that they cannot match us-and when I say us, I mean our allies and Japan and the United States-they cannot match us if we are determined to build up our defenses. So they then face the fact that as we build them up, they might then find themselves weaker than we are. It was all summed up in a cartoon in one of our papers. This was before the death of Leonid Brezhnev. Brezhnev was portrayed talking to a Russian general, and he was saying to the general, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. Let me just follow up my question. Some of the dangers that I refer to do not take place only in the context of the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. I think some of the regional conflicts have indigenous roots for that. And I just wonder if we are not having the kind of crises and dangers that do not lend themselves to the military solutions, which might call for some other approach to solving these problems and thereby reducing the tension in the world as a whole. Well, if I understand your question correctly, what we are talking about is-you mentioned the Middle East. Once upon a time, nations like our own with oceans around us, we could have a defensive army on our own land, we could have coastal artillery batteries, and we knew that if a war came to us, it would come to our shores and we would defend our shores. Today there are strategic points in various places in the world. The Middle East is one. Could the allies, Western Europe, could Japan stand by and see the Middle East come into the hands of someone who would deny the oil of the Middle East to the industrialized world? Could we see that energy supply shut off without knowing that it would bring absolute ruin to our countries? There are other areas. More than half of the minerals that the United States needs for its own industries comes from spots all over the world. Well, an aggressor nation, a nation that maybe has designs on other nations, recognizes that also. We have to look and see where are those strategic spots which we cannot afford to let fall. With the problem of Cuba in the Mediterranean-in the Caribbean, we have to recognize that more than half of all of our shipping of those necessities we must have come through the Caribbean. It was not an accident that back in the First World War that the German submarine packs took up their places there. We know that the strategic waterways of the world-the Soviet Union has now built up the greatest navy in the world, and the biggest part of that navy is here in the Pacific, in the vicinity of your own country. But they know, as anyone must know in world strategy, that there are a limited number of choke points, sea passages that are essential to your livelihood and to ours. You can start with the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal, but then the Straits of Gibraltar, but then right here in the passages that lead to your own island, the Malacca and the Makassar Straits. There are a total of no more than 16 in the whole world. And a nation that could dominate those narrow passages and shut them off to our shipping could secure victory without firing a shot at any of us. Let us turn to an economic issue. Mr. ENTITY, the American economy has been rapidly improving, we hear, yet unemployment is still high. Could you tell us what you believe will happen to the American domestic economy in the coming year and whether the improvement of the American economy, domestic economy will help to resolve remaining trade problems between the United States and Japan? Well, the American economy is improving. This recession that we have just been going through is the eighth that we have known in the last 40 or so years. And each time in the past our government has resorted to what I call a quick fix. It has artificially stimulated the money supply; it has stimulated government spending, increased taxes on the people which reduced their incentive to produce. And yes, there would be seeming recovery from the recession which would last about 2 or 3 years because it was artificial, and then we would be into another recession. And each time the recession was deeper and worse than the one before. Well, we embarked on an economic program that was based on reducing government spending to leave a greater share of the earnings of the people in the hands of the people. We not only reduced the spending, we reduced taxes. And it was set out to be a lasting and real recovery. When we started in 1981 our recession was about-roughly 121/2 percent. People were saying that it could not be eliminated in less than 10 years. Our interest rates were more than double what they are now. Our program, once put into effect, and as the tax cuts did have the effect we hoped they would have on the ability of people to purchase but also the incentive of their being allowed to keep more of the money they earned-the inflation for the last year has been running at about 2 1/2 percent or so, down from the 12.4. The interest rates, as I said, have been halved. We have a long way to go. The last thing to recover will be unemployment. But even there, last month our unemployment dropped to a rate that in our own optimistic predictions we had said would not happen until the end of 1984. And here it is in 1983, down to what we'd predicted that far ahead. We have come down from a very high unemployment rate to 8.7 percent. And I think that we are on the road to a solid recovery. I will tell you, when our political opponents were claiming that our plan would not work, they named it Reaganomics. And lately, they have not been calling it Reaganomics anymore. I assume, because it is working. But what it will do for the rest of the world and our own relationship, I think that our country-I think your country, largely-certainly between the two of us, we do affect the world's economy. The world has been in recession. And I think that the United States and Japan and, certainly, with us together, we can help bring back and bring out of recession the rest of the industrial world. Mr. ENTITY, you said that-in the National Diet this morning-that you have vigorously opposed the quick fix of protectionism in America. But there remains the danger of protectionist legislation to restrict Japanese imports to the United States. Do you believe such anticompetitive legislation will be passed? And in regard to this, what do you think of the steps which Japan has been taking to further open up its own markets? We heartily approve. And one of the things that we have been discussing are some of the points of difference that still remain between our two marketplaces. And I have pointed to the danger of those in our Congress who, because of the unemployment, think the answer could be protectionism. Well, I think that protectionism destroys everything we want. I believe in free trade and fair trade. And yet, the pressure on them as legislators to adopt these bills, these measures-I am opposed to them-and yet, as I say, I know they are under that pressure. And they are tempted. And they are talking of this. There probably have been 40 bills that have been brought up and proposed, all of which would have some elements in them of protectionism. But as I described it in the speech to the Diet this morning, protectionism is-that is the case of one fellow shooting a hole in the bottom of the boat, and then the other fellow answers by shooting another hole in the boat. Well, you do not get well; you get wet. And I do not want us to start shooting holes in the bottom of the boat. ENTITY Well, Mr. ENTITY, unfortunately time is running out. And that will be our last question. I understand you have a strong interest in increasing personal contacts between the Japanese and the Americans. ENTITY. Yes. Do you have any idea, specific idea how this could be accomplished? Well, yes. I think we can increase our student exchange. Almost 14,000 of your fine young people are in our country now. We would like to see more of ours coming here. There is talk now of the Association of Japanese and American Businessmen in using private funds, having an American House in Tokyo as we have a Japanese House in New York, both designed for more cultural exchange, more things such as student exchange and all. And I believe, again, that is another example of people talking to each other instead of about each other. Well, Mr. ENTITY, I am awfully sorry, but that is all the time we had. And I thank you very much on behalf of all these participants. Well, thank all of you for the opportunity. I am sorry the time went by so fast. Maybe my answers were too long.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrepresentativesnhktelevisiontokyojapan", "title": "Interview With Representatives of NHK Television in Tokyo, Japan", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-representatives-nhk-television-tokyo-japan", "publication_date": "11-11-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 326, "text": "ENTITY, a lot of people say this might be your first trip to London, but it is not. No, it is not. I have been there a couple of times. I remember, Laura and I went to see Cats in London. Gosh, I remember going to some nice pubs when I was a drinking man in London. It is a great city, and I am looking forward to going. We are looking forward to seeing you there, too. In fact, of course, you are famous for the fact that normally social- dressing up socially is not your favorite thing, and you once said that marvelous quote, Read my lips: No new tuxes. That is right. Are you going to take a new tux this time? I am going to take a tux, and I am going to take tails. And do not tell anybody, but I had to rent them. I am sure you will not tell anybody. This is entirely between us. I am looking forward to- it is a huge honor to be invited by Her Majesty to stay in Buckingham Palace. It is hard to imagine me even considering staying in Buckingham Palace when I was living in Midland, Texas. It is just one of those things. And Buckingham Palace has got a tremendous mystique to it, and so Laura and I are really looking forward to coming. And you pinch yourself about those things too. What would you like to see come out of this trip in terms of- in addition to the fun part? Well, I have got some business to do with Tony Blair. We have got a lot of things to discuss. We are going to talk about how to continue to spread freedom and peace. We will talk about how to work the compassion agenda on the AIDS Initiative, for example. We are going to spend some time talking about that. I value his advice, and I-every time I visit with him, whether it be on the phone or on video or in person, I come away with a-some interesting ideas about how to advance a positive agenda. Secondly, I look forward to speaking to the people of your great country. I am going to have a chance to give a speech to talk about the importance of our relationship, the unique relationship between America and Great Britain. And I will have a chance to answer some questions, I am sure, from what we call the Fourth Estate here, the mighty media. I look forward to it. And Tony Blair on Monday night-and he would probably have told you-is expecting there to be quite a lot of protesters about the war. What would be your message to those protesters? Well, freedom is a beautiful thing, I would first say, and are not you lucky to be in a country that encourages people to speak their mind. And I value going to a country where people are free to say anything they want to say. Secondly, I would say that I understand you do not like war, and neither do I. But I would hope you understand that I have learned the lessons of September the 11th, 2001, and that terrorists declared war on the United States of America and war on people that love freedom, and I intend to lead our Nation, along with others like our close friends in Great Britain, to win this war on terror, that war is my last choice, not my first choice, but I have an obligation as the ENTITY to keep our country secure. And at the same time, you will be working with Tony Blair, and what is the key to your working together so well? I mean, it is like you have a special relationship. Is partially the bond, the bond that you are both men of strong faith? I think so. Tony is a man of strong faith. You know, the key to my relationship with Tony is he tells the truth, and he tells you what he thinks, and when he says he is going to do something, he is going to do it. I trust him, therefore. I have seen him, under some tough-tough circumstances, stand strong, and I appreciate that in a person. The other thing I admire about Tony Blair is that he is got a vision beyond the current. In other words, he can see a world that is peaceful, and he agrees with me that the spread of democracy and freedom in parts of the world where there is violence and hatred will help change the world, that there are reformers in the Middle East that long for democracy, that long to live in a free world. And Tony Blair, like me, agrees-kind of rejects the elitist point of view that only a certain type of person can adapt the habits of freedom and democracy. And he knows that freedom in the Middle East will help change that world in dramatic fashion. So it is an historic moment which he has been willing to seize, and I am honored to be working with him to seize the moment. And in terms of as you look at the world, ENTITY, at the moment and you see the protesters in Australia or wherever they are and you see that poll that came out, an EU poll the other day that shows that the United States was second among the most dangerous countries in terms of war in the world-level, for God's sake, with North Korea and Iran- when you see things like that, do you think the world is out of step with America, or America is out of step with the world? Well, first of all, you have got to know, I do not pay attention to the polls. I just do not . I have got a job to do for the American people. It is a job that was changed on September the 11th, 2001, and I refuse to-I refuse to forget-I will never forget the lessons, is a better way to put it, of what happened to this country. And there are terrorists who are willing to kill innocent life in order to create fear and chaos. There are terrorists who want the free world to retreat from duties so that they can impose Taliban-type governments and enslave people. There are people like Saddam Hussein, who tortured and maimed and killed and, at the same time, threatened and created the conditions of instability. And I know some people do not understand the need to deal with that, but I feel firmly we must deal with those issues. But do you need to woo people more in the rest of the world? We wooed-we did a pretty good job of wooing them at the United Nations. After all, remember, 1441 was a unanimous vote that said, after a decade of sending messages to Mr. Saddam Hussein for him to disarm, 1441 said, Disarm or there will be serious consequences. And that was a unanimous vote. In other words, the world, at least the Security Council, came together and sent a clear signal. Obviously, there was a disagreement about the definition of serious consequence. But I can assure you, serious consequence is not more resolutions or more debate. Serious consequence was with dealing with Mr. Saddam Hussein today, before it became too late. And I understand people do not agree with that position. But nevertheless, I am convinced that the decisions we made- and there is a lot of countries that made that decision with us-that decision will make the world more peaceful and more free. That decision is in the long-term interests of people who love freedom. And will you ever be able to forgive Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Schroeder for their actions of that time in undermining the second resolution? Of course. It is like, I can understand why people express their disagreement with the policy. I understand not everybody is going to agree with every decision that I make or others make. But I have had meetings with Gerhard Schroeder and Jacques Chirac since then. They have been very cordial meetings. Gerhard Schroeder has now committed German troops to Afghanistan, which is a very important mission, to help stabilize that good country as it not only enacts a constitution but heads toward elections. And I appreciate the contribution of the German Government toward Afghanistan. I am proud to say that it is a vital contribution, and I appreciate their willingness to work with us. Again, we are not going to agree on every issue, but a Europe which works closely with America and an America which works closely with Europe means the world will be better off. The difference really is, between Tony Blair and them, is that Tony Blair sees Europe as a partner of the United States, and they perhaps see Europe as a rival of the United States. I do not think Germany sees that, for starters. In my conversations with Gerhard Schroeder, they never yielded that impression. I think Germany understands it is important for the bilateral relationship between America and Germany to be strong. It is in our economic interests that it is strong. It is in the interest of peace that it be strong. I understand there was kind of this notion of multipolarity, which means that somehow the values of America need to be offset. But we are for peace; we are for freedom. This country is leading the world when it comes to fighting AIDS. And I can assure you, having studied this issue a lot, and I understand the pandemic of AIDS on the continent of Africa, we will be better off-the people of Africa will be better off if Europe and the United States work together to fight the pandemic of AIDS. My only point is, there is a lot we can do working together. And what about the-I gather that you have some misgivings about the proposed European army, the danger that it might be a threat to NATO. Yes, here is the thing, first of all, I believe that the European defense force ought to take on more responsibility on those missions which NATO turns down. I think it is good for the United States' interests. I think it is good for NATO's interests, so long as the defense force does not undermine the vitality of NATO. And Tony Blair tells me that the discussions he is having with other European countries will in no way undermine NATO, and I take his word for it. He is been a man who is been true to his word on a lot of issues, and I believe he will be true to his word on this issue. Tell me about-in terms of Iraq, tell me about weapons of mass destruction. The fact that we did not find them, and so on, has been much discussed. But do you think that you were the victim of a failure of intelligence in a way? Not at all. No? No, not at all. I think our intelligence was sound. I know the British intelligence was sound. It is the same intelligence that caused the United Nations to pass resolution after resolution after resolution. It is the same intelligence that was used by my predecessor to bomb Iraq. I am very confident we got good intelligence. And not only that, Mr. David Kay, who went over to kind of lead the effort to find the weapons or the intent of weapons, came back with a report that clearly stated that Mr. Saddam Hussein would-had been in material breach of Resolution 1441. In other words, had the inspectors found what Kay found, they would have reported back to the United Nations that he was in breach, that he was in violation of exactly what the United Nations expected him not to do. We will find the truth. But this guy for many years had been hiding weapons, deceiving weapons. He had dual-use programs that could have been sped up. Nobody could say that Saddam Hussein was not a danger. Not only was he a danger to the free world-and that is what the world said; the world said it consistently-he was a danger to his own people as well. Remember, we discovered mass graves with hundreds of thousands of men and women and children clutching their little toys, as a result of this person's brutality. Go ahead. Sorry. But in terms of-did you feel, in terms of if there was not a failure of intelligence, that there was a sort of exaggeration in what was predicted? I mean, did you ever believe that stuff, for instance? Did you ever believe that stuff about him having weapons of mass destruction that could be unleashed in 45 minutes, or did you never really believe that? I believe he was a dangerous man. But you did not believe that. Well, I believed a lot of things. But I know he was a dangerous man. And I know that for the sake of security, he needed to be dealt with. After all- again I repeat this because it is a very important point that people in your country must remember, and that is, the world had spoken, universally spoken, about this man's danger for 12 long years. And in order for-at the very minimum, in order for a multinational organization to be valid and effective, something has to happen other than resolutions. And when an organization says, If you do not disarm -in other words, in order to say, They do not disarm, intelligence convinced a lot of nations, including France, that he had weapons. In other words, he had to disarm something. Dismantle your programs. If you do not do that, there will be a serious consequence. And the fundamental question is, what is a serious consequence ? It is not another resolution. It is not more empty debate. A serious consequence, in this case, was removing Saddam Hussein so that his weapons programs would not be activated. And David Kay found evidence of weapons programs. He found some biological weapons-evidence of biological weapons. And it does not take much time-- But we really need the big discovery, do not we? Well, that is pretty big, what I just told you. Now remember, for a long period of time, it was assumed that he did not have a nuclear weapons program. And yet, after 1991, the world had to- changed its attitude about this man's nuclear weapons program and admitted that it was very advanced. A nuclear weapon in the hands of somebody like Saddam Hussein, particularly given the lessons of September the 11th, 2001, would be a horrendous development. And we had to deal with him. And we did-in a way, by the way, that was a compassionate way. We spared innocent life. We targeted the guilty, and we moved hard and fast. And very little of Iraq was touched in toppling Saddam Hussein. Did we, in fact-people have said, ENTITY, as you know, that the same meticulous planning that went into winning the war did not go into winning the peace, and we were a bit unprepared for some of the surprises, the unpleasant surprises, you know, the terrorists and all of that that came along. Is that a fair comment? No--it is not a fair comment. We look at all contingencies and are dealing with the contingencies. Look, let me-if I could step back and maybe think out loud here about some of the stories or some of the speculation that was going on before we went into Iraq: One, the oil revenues would be blown up; the oil fields would be destroyed. They were not . As a matter of fact, oil production is up to 2.1 million or 2.2 million barrels a day, to the benefit of the Iraqi people. That is a very important point. Remember, there was speculation about sectarian violence, that the long-suppressed Kurds or Shi'a may take out their anxieties and their frustrations on the Sunnis. That did not happen. There was talk about mass starvation; it did not happen. Refugee flows that would be unmanageable-that never happened. And so a lot of the contingency that we had planned for did not happen. What has happened is that in a relatively small part of the country, there are Ba'athist-- You call it now the Ba'athist Triangle. --Sunni Triangle, they are attacking. And they are attacking not only coalition forces; they are attacking innocent Iraqis, because what they are trying to do is stop the spread of progress. It is almost a guerrilla war there, really. Well, I would call it a desperate attempt by people who were totally in control of government, through tyrannical means, to regain power. This is nothing more than a power grab. Now, there are some foreign fighters, mujahideen types or Al Qaida or Al Qaida affiliates involved as well. They have got a different mission. They want to install a Taliban-type Government in Iraq, or they want to seek revenge for getting whipped in Afghanistan. But nevertheless, they all have now found common ground for a brief period of time. And what we will do is, we will use Iraqi intelligence; we will use Iraqi security forces-we are up to about 118,000 Iraqi folks in one type of uniform or another securing the country-to be a integral part of chasing these killers down and to bring them to justice before they kill innocent life. But it must have taken us a bit by surprise, or otherwise we'd have prepared for it, the level of this-the combination of the, what, 700, perhaps, foreign terrorists who came into Iraq, and so on. That was-- I do not think so. I think a lot the people who came in initially wish they had not come in initially, or they are not wishing at all right now. But no, we understood it was going to be tough. We have been there for 7 months, David, which seems like a long time, particularly giving the news cycles the way they are. I am certainly not complaining about the news cycles, but nevertheless, there is a certain sense of impatience that has now crept into the world. And my job is to enable our operators and military to make adjustments necessary to succeed. We have got the same strategy, which is a peaceful Iraq. The tactics shift, depending upon the decisions of the enemy. We are making progress. That is not to say it is not tough. Of course, it is tough. What they want to do is, they want to shake the will of the free world. And the good news about having a partner like Tony Blair is, he will not be shaken. And neither will I, and neither will Jose Maria Aznar. I heard Berlusconi stand up with a strong statement after the Italian police had been murdered. And we, of course, send our sympathies and prayers to the Italian people. But Berlusconi said, They are not going to run us out. And that is what these terrorists need to hear. And more importantly, or as importantly, the Iraqi citizens need to hear that. They need to know that we will not leave the country prematurely. They need to know two things: We are not going to cut and run; and two, we believe they have the capacity to run their own country. The cut-and-run thing, obviously, is absolutely vital. And you have said you are not going to cut and run. You will be there as long as it takes. Tony Blair, in his speech on Monday night, said, We are not going to retreat one inch. I mean, we are there for how long it takes to produce a successful Iraqi democracy, are we? Yes, absolutely. Whether that is years and years or what? Well, we do not think it will be years and years, because, first of all, we think the Iraqi people are plenty capable of running their own country, and we think they want to run their own country. And just today I had discussions with Jerry Bremer, our Ambassador in Baghdad, who flew back to discuss ways-- Oh, yes-- Well, just to discuss ways to do-to assure the Iraqi people that we have confidence in their capability. See, some in the world, some in the world do not believe that Iraq can run itself. They believe that, Might as well let them have a military dictatorship or a tyrant. That is the only way they can be governed. I disagree, and Tony Blair disagrees with that. We believe that democracy will take hold in Iraq, and we believe a free and democratic Iraq will help change the Middle East. There are hundreds of reformers that are desperate for freedom. Freedom- freedom is not America's gift to the world or Great Britain's gift to the world. Freedom is the Almighty's gift to everybody who lives in the world. Is there any likelihood that Saddam himself could be behind this violence? Saddam Hussein is a violent man. Listen, he tortured and maimed and killed. He had rape rooms, and people disappeared because they spoke out against him. We have discovered mass graves. He is a brutal, brutal tyrant-brutal tyrant. We did the Iraqi people a great favor by removing him. So I would not be surprised that any kind of violence is promoted by him, but I do not know. I do not know. All I know is, we are after him. That is one of the interesting things. I mean, nobody has time for a moment for Saddam Hussein. Some people are worried in England and around the world by the idea of regime change, because they say, Once we have done regime change, Britain and America with Saddam Hussein, what can we say if India wants to do regime change with Pakistan, or Pakistan wants to do regime change with India? Well, see, I can understand their concerns, except they forgot the history. This issue has been discussed in the United Nations for over a decade. And the United Nations, as a multilateral international body, passed resolution after resolution after resolution calling for Saddam Hussein to disarm. In other words, the diplomatic process went forward. There was plenty of diplomacy. And to the critics, I would say that there will be diplomacy when it comes to India and Pakistan. The world will speak out clearly. The problem is, is that when the world speaks out clearly and then nothing happens, all we have got is empty words. It is tyrants that take advantage of that. Tyrants- if tyrants do not fear-feel like they can torture and kill with impunity, feel like they can blackmail the world, and all the world does is put out empty words, it makes multilateralism extremely ineffective. If I could take a second to remind your viewers that, obviously, not every situation needs to be solved militarily. Military option is the last option, as far as I am concerned. And I would refer people to North Korea, where we have got a multilateral attempt to convince Kim Chong-il to get rid of his nuclear ambitions. We understand, just like Saddam Hussein, that he has been torturous to his people-people in North Korea are starving to death-and that weapons of mass destruction in his hands given his history, just like weapons of mass destruction in Saddam's hands given his history, is a very dangerous element. It is a dangerous-it inhibits the capacity for peace and freedom to spread. But what I have done is, I have convinced China and South Korea and Japan and Russia to speak with one voice to the North Koreans, and say, Get rid of your nuclear ambitions. We are also, at the same time, working on a counterproliferation regime that will stop his ability to ship weapons of mass destruction or a nuclear warhead to a terrorist group. In other words, we are working together in a multilateral, multinational fashion to bring peace and stability to the world. Someone who knows how passionate you are about this war on terror and Iraq and so on said, I know ENTITY, and I think, in terms of his legacy, he'd rather-I will tell you how strongly he feels. He said he'd rather be defeated by the voters than by the terrorists. Is that true? I'd rather not be defeated by either. And we will not be defeated by the terrorists. I say that confidently, because the allies in the war on terror are strong and steadfast, and there is no stronger and steadfast ally in the war on terror than Tony Blair. He understands the stakes. He knows that freedom is being challenged. He understands as well that the spread of freedom and democracy, in the long run, will defeat terror. And that is why the battle-the stakes are so high in Iraq right now. By the way, Iraq is a front in the war on terror. And it is important for people to understand that, because the war takes place elsewhere. And in-one of the reasons that people say, in the Arab world-obviously there was your landmark speech last week-but in the Arab world, that you will not really be able to address the balance against America until the United States is seen not to tilt towards Israel in the Middle East. What do you think about that? I think about that: I think it is an excuse, because America-I am the first ENTITY ever to go to the United Nations-- And say, two-- Two states side by side in peace. --two states. No President has ever said that. And I said it, and I said it with conviction, because I believe it is in Israel's interest that there be a peaceful Palestinian state, and I know it is in the Palestinians' interest. However, to achieve a peaceful Palestinian state, the emergence of a peaceful Palestinian state, a state where people are willing to risk capital, a place where people are willing to develop an economy, there must be a focused effort to defeat terror. And there has not been with the current Palestinian leadership. I went in and embraced, in Aqaba, Jordan, Abu Mazen. And the reason I did so, David, is because he came to the Oval Office and he said, I will join you in the fight against terror. We are not going to allow the few to destroy the hopes of the many. As well, I could sense in his talk, in his feeling, that he has-he is got great trust in the Palestinian people. In other words, given the chance, the Palestinian people will develop the habits of democracy, and out of that will come a great state, a peaceful state. And I trusted him, and we were working with him. We were making good progress. And I was working with Ariel Sharon. I gave a speech on June 24th, 2002, which says, All of us have responsibilities, and you, Israel, have a responsibility. Do you think Ariel Sharon could ever emerge as a man of peace? Yes, I do. I believe he wants peace for his people. I truly do. I mean, he is a man who has presided over suiciders, where he has to go to the funerals of women and children because some cold-blooded killer is trying to destroy the hopes of all the people in the region. And it is -yes, I believe so. And I believe he believes in a Palestinian state. I have asked him in the Oval Office, I said, Listen, am I out there by myself on a Palestinian state, or will you support it? He said he will. But both of us understand, as do a lot of other people, that for a state to emerge, there must be a focused effort to get after the Hamas killers, for example, who want to destroy the hopes of the people that believe in a Palestinian state. And there has not been that effort. Anyway, let me finish my Abu Mazen story, if you do not mind. I embraced the guy, and I believe that he is a-I believe he is a partner with whom we can work, and he is shoved out. Progress is being made, and he is shoved aside by the old guard. And that is unacceptable behavior. It is just unacceptable. Guantanamo. You are going to get asked about, obviously, in England, what is going to happen to our British detainees. Tony Blair was talking about it in the House of Commons this week and saying, hopefully they'd be tried before a proper court or repatriated to be tried in the U.K. Will you have any good news for us on that? For him on that? You mean right here, sitting right here, me and you, talking-the good news is, one, they will be treated fairly, like they are. And two, I am working closely with Tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with. And I emphasize, a solution that he is comfortable with. These prisoners are being treated-these were illegal non-combatants picked up off of a battlefield. And they are being well-treated, and they will go through a military tribunal at some point in time, which is-a military tribunal, which is in international accord- or in line with international accords. As we approach the end of this interview, ENTITY-I could carry on for hours, actually, but I know you have got a lot to do, more than the rest of us. As we approach the end of this interview, what would you say is the most important lesson you have learned in life in the Presidency? The most important lesson in life in the Presidency is to have a clear vision of where you want to lead, and lead. I have got a clear vision: It is a world that is more free and therefore more peaceful; a world based upon human rights, human dignity, and justice; a world that does not discriminate between one group of people or-a vision that does not discriminate between one group of people or another, because I believe all people have the desire to be free. And I am willing to lead there. And the people of this country will make their-you asked about politics-they will make the decision as to whether or not they-I have have been honest with them and open with them and whether or not they like my leadership style. A lot of it will have to do with the economy, of course, whether I get another 4 years. But I think it is important to know where you want to lead, and lead. Would you hope to present to the country the same team, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell and Condi Rice, for the second term? It is been a fabulous team, and Cheney for certain. And I have not -obviously, I am not going to talk to my Cabinet ministers until after the election. But I am proud of this team. I put together one of the finest teams, one of the finest administrations any President has ever assembled. These are good, honest, decent, hard-working, experienced people who give me good, unvarnished advice and, when I make a decision, say, Yes, sir, ENTITY, we will go execute it. Well, thank you for your decision to do this interview. Thank you, sir.

{"id": 107, "text": "Thank you for appearing here on New York 1, sir. Thank you. Glad to do it. ENTITY, this has been a bitter, nasty campaign season across the country in which Republicans have made you the issue of local races in commercials linking you directly to the local Democrats. While many Democrats have held open arms to campaign with you, some have kept their distance. How do you feel that you are the direct target, your administration? Well, they have worked hard on this for a long time. The Republicans tend to be a Presidential party, and they are unfortunately now very extremist, very negative, and that is what they have tried to do. But you know, there is beginning to be a backlash. First of all, the American people see that I am keeping the commitments I made to them in 1992. In 21 months, we have moved the country forward. We are making the Government work for ordinary Americans with things like family leave and college loans. We have reduced the debt. We have reduced the size of the Federal Government. We have got more jobs coming into this economy. The world is safer and more prosperous than it was when I took office. People are feeling that, and I do not believe they are going to buy these Republican promises in this contract, this $1 trillion worth of hot check promises to go back to the 1980's and trickle-down economics. I also would point out, ENTITY, you know, there is beginning to be some division within the Republican ranks. People are recoiling; good Republicans are recoiling from this extremism and this negativism. That is why former First Lady Nancy Reagan hit Oliver North and, of course, Mayor Giuliani supporting Governor Cuomo I think a very statesman-like decision Mayor Riordan out in Los Angeles supporting Senator Feinstein, Mrs. Heinz in Pennsylvania attacking the Republican candidate for Senator up there. There are a lot of good Republicans who do not like what has been happening in our country, and they do not like seeing the Republican Party being so negative, so bitterly partisan, and so extremist. So I think we have got a chance in the last 8 days to get a real vote for the future and not a vote for the past. And I am very hopeful. ENTITY, you touched upon a couple of topics that I want to get to, but just yesterday you were campaigning for Democrats in Pittsburgh, and we are told that you are headed to New York once again to campaign Thursday for Mario Cuomo. The last time you were here, you said Mr. Cuomo is a national treasure, that he is New York's treasure. How do you explain him being in the tough battle against George Pataki? Well, I think, first of all, he has been Governor. And after you have been Governor awhile, you will pick up your fair share of enemies if you take on the tough decisions and you deal with the tough issues. Secondly, as we all know, Senator D'Amato and Mr. Pataki, their group, they are very good at attacking their opponents and they have done a good job of that. But I think Governor Cuomo is coming back. And I think if you look at the action that Mayor Giuliani took, he was a person who had to say, Look, never mind all this negative back-and-forth, how are the people of my city going to live, and are they going to be better off depending on who the Governor is? So he endorsed Governor Cuomo. When I said Governor Cuomo was a national treasure but is New York's treasure first, I would just remind the voters of New York who wonder whether he really wants to be Governor again that I offered him a chance to have a very different career in Washington, DC, and he rejected it to stay with New York, because he wanted to have a chance to be Governor while he has a partner in the White House, someone really committed to helping improve the fortunes of the people of New York. That was clear evidence to me that his heart was first, foremost, and forever with the people of New York, and I think that they will be very well pleased with his performance in the next 4 years if they will give him a chance to be Governor. Thank you very much, ENTITY. We will see you in New York on Thursday.

{"id": 541, "text": "We are grateful-the bureau chief has deferred to me to let me ask the first question. And first of all, I'd like to say we are grateful that you have taken the time to meet with us today. And if-since I know your time is very limited, we'd like to just get started right now. ENTITY, some Members of Congress are proposing a delay in military aid to the contras to allow time for another attempt to draw the Sandinistas into negotiations with the contras. Would you accept some delay-if not 6 months, which I know you do not want-but some delay in providing military aid if that meant Congress would approve your request? Well, I think there is several ways in which things like that are being suggested. First of all, from the time that they would-if they would vote to approve this aid, there would be a period of time before it would actually be carried out. And, yes, if there is any possibility that during that time, and perhaps to forestall such aid, that they would then be willing to come to the negotiating table-as we have tried to get them nine times already-and to negotiate with the contras, that'd be fine. But if we are talking about some kind of a compromise where the Congress imposes a delay and takes the trigger away from me in- You mean like requiring a second vote? Yes, there would be a second vote and so forth, I think this would be most counterproductive because the Sandinistas would feel they could hang on longer with the hope that we still would not get what we are asking for. It sounds like the trigger is the problem. If, for example, a delay of, say, 60 to 75 days, after which the aid would go whether-without a second congressional vote, does that seem like the basis for a compromise to you? Well, I'd be willing to talk to them about something of this kind. I would not want to commit to this because, as I say, the important thing is that the Sandinista government must not be left any loopholes in which they believe there still might be a denial of this help. So, your real problem is the trigger in the second vote? Yes, yes. They have to know that we mean it and that we are going to help the contras. ENTITY, some administration officials have said that 18 months of military aid to the contras is all that will be needed to bring the Sandinistas to the negotiating table and that you will not be back for more. Alfonso Robelo, one of the contra leaders who you met with here last week, has said he does not feel that anything more than 18 months would be needed, and he did not feel that they would want to prolong the bloodshed there beyond that. What happens after 18 months and the contras have still not forced the Sandinistas to the negotiating table? Well, I think this is something that you have to look at if such a time should come. But I am pleased that those men who are most familiar with the resources of the contras have that feeling. They are acquainted with their ability. There is no question that when we were able to give them some help, the contras were giving the Sandinista forces great problems. But you have got to remember that for the last couple of years, other than the humanitarian aid, they were shut off. And that is why they are so limited in the numbers. They have got a potential force of around 25,000. There are about 6,000 now fighting in Nicaragua. But this is a matter of the lack of arms and munitions. Well, it does sound, Mr. ENTITY, that you are not saying that 18 months is necessarily the end of it and you might, in fact, have to come back for more. Is that correct? I would-yes, I think it would be foolish to commit yourself to anything of that kind because this, too, then could stiffen the Sandinistas' resistance and say all we have to do is hold out for 18 months. Mr. ENTITY, you have said that the overriding issue in Central America is America's national security. You have also said, if I may quote: We send money and material now so we will never have to send our own American boys. Is it possible that someday American troops will have to be sent? Well, here is the thing everyone is overlooking. Here is this third Communist-well, let-I cannot call it an attempt. Here would be the third of the bases that they had established, the Communist bloc, and the first one on our mainland. And they, themselves, have made it plain that they are part of the expansionist philosophy, that Marxian philosophy and belief of a one-world Communist state. Now, what you have to say is, if we do nothing and this is allowed to grow and expand and carry its revolution across other borders, then the threat would remain that there would come a day when their hostilities would be directed at our own interests. And that is the time in which you could say that, yes, then American forces would be involved because the hostilities were directed at us. I do not see it, as some interpret it, that, well, we are leaving the door open; that we may still use troops down there. I do not think we'd have a friend left in Latin America if we used American forces. The image of the great colossus of the North is still too much in their minds. The contras do not want us. They want our help, they want the tools. They have made it plain; they will furnish the manpower. So when I said three, I noticed you kind of paused and looked at each other there. Let me point out something that everyone is neglecting up there on the Hill to pay attention to. When we, in the Grenada operation, got possession of all those documents, as well as the arms and the weapons that were already installed in Grenada by the Soviet bloc, we got documents from the Soviet Government, from the Cuban Government addressed to the Communists there in Grenada. And over and over again they referred to that they had Cuba, they had Nicaragua, they had Grenada, and then they went on to discuss what the future goals were and the other targets there in Central America and the Caribbean. So that there was no question about this being a target for Soviet expansionism, using proxies the way they have now with Cuba and all. So the goal is made very plain. Now, this last-again, this threat that a Nicaragua could pose, when I was in Grenada the nine Prime Ministers of the tiny Caribbean island nations unanimously-and they brought it up, I was not even discussing this subject. They brought it up to me. They said, You must continue helping the rebels in Nicaragua because this Nicaragua, under this government, is the greatest threat to our existence, to those nine nations. So, we are not the only ones that see this as a cancer that must be excised. Now, as part of the request to Congress for aid to the contras, there is a provision that would allow the use of CIA contingency funds, and I was wondering, on top of the $100 million that you are asking, I was wondering, well, why is the use of these funds considered necessary, and what would they be used for? Well, because under restrictions that have already been put on us by Congress, we cannot give advice, we cannot offer training, we cannot exchange intelligence information with the contras. And we feel that if we are going to help them with weapons and arms that we ought to be freed of those restrictions and allowed to provide this other assistance to them. I see. By that other assistance, do you mean additional funding over and above the $100 million? No, it is not that as much as it is-well, or whatever the cost might be and being able to give them military intelligence and help with military planning. One of the conditions, sir, the United States has set for Nicaragua is the holding of free elections. If free elections were held and the Sandinistas won, would we accept the result? I think we'd have to. This would-then we'd be back to a case similar to the Philippines in which the whole goal of the revolution and of the negotiations would be a government that would be chosen by the people of Nicaragua. Remember that the contras are supporting a guarantee that was given to the Organization of American States of what the revolution against Somoza was supposed to gain. They provided that information to the Organization of American States when they asked the Organization to try and persuade Somoza to step down to end the killing. And he did. But before they asked him to, the Organization asked the revolutionaries to give them what were their revolutionary goals. And they were provided, and the goals were a pluralistic, democratic society, free speech, freedom of religion-all the things that go with democracy. And it was the Sandinistas, as one faction of the revolution, that ousted their fellow revolutionaries when they got control-took over and installed a totalitarian, Communist regime. Now, the contras say what they want is to get back to the original goal which requires letting the people of that country make the decisions to how they want to be governed. Mr. ENTITY, in your current campaign to try to raise votes for the contra aid next week, you and some of your aides have been emphasizing that the people who do not support you on this are going to be held accountable by history, or by whomever, for their failure to back you up on it. And my question is since this includes a lot of Republicans, as well as Democrats, whether you are going to be unwilling to support in the coming congressional election those people who do not support you on this vote? No, and I think-let me-no, I think the thing has been-that whole question has kind of been exaggerated into assailing the motives of the people that would vote against us. Well, we are not doing anything of the kind. What we are pointing out is what I said earlier-that the choice here is either negotiations leading to a political settlement or this cancer continuing to grow. What we are trying to point out is that this is not an argument about two methods of dealing with the problem-if one wanted to do one thing and wanted another, but the goals were the same. What we are trying to make them realize is that it is an either/or situation. Either we are able to press them into negotiating and coming to a political settlement or they remain a Communist base, another Cuba. Does that mean you will not have any political hard feelings toward Republicans who do not back you up on this? Well, I think I'd better-I'd just better swallow hard and not answer a question like that. Mr. ENTITY, in reaction to your order that the Soviets have to reduce their mission at the United Nations, the Soviets have sent up a formal protest note and said that such actions as that do not create the climate for a summit. Do you have any comment on that? Well, yes. So far we have not heard-or I have not certainly heard of anything from the General Secretary. But remember, this is not like an Embassy where there is retaliation or-this is the one place, the United Nations-and it is the only one, and it is here in our country. And they have a delegation that is larger than the next two delegations, to them put together. And there is no way that you can justify the size of their delegation here except that they have other goals than just the- In other words, they are spies. Is that what you are saying, Mr. ENTITY? Yes, and I think that we have enough knowledge of their actions to know that they are there for that purpose-for other purposes and for espionage, not for the doings of the United Nations. Mr. ENTITY, it does seem, though, that the promise of Geneva just 6 months ago is largely unfulfilled right now-arms control talks have bogged down, there is inability to set the date for a new summit, and now the staff reductions. Has a new chill entered U.S.-Soviet relations? No, this project has been on our minds for quite some time. The arms talks-I still continue to be hopeful because the General Secretary in his proposals-this is the first time I can recall any Soviet leader actually being willing to eliminate weapons they already have. And we in turn accepted a great many of their figures and their proposals, but there were-it is a complicated thing because we do not both have the same numbers of the same kinds of weapons, and so we then put in some-taking their proposal in which, as I say, in overall terms: 50-percent reduction, ultimate elimination, and so forth-we accepted. We put in some other things that we thought were essential to such a program, and there were no further negotiations. In other words, they have, at the moment, seem to be in a position in which we accept their offer entirely or else. And we think that negotiations mean that you try to find a common meeting ground on some differences that you may have in there on figures. And we have not had a response. We put before our people there in Geneva the framework for meeting their proposal and with some changes that we felt should be made because of fairness and expediting the program, and we have had no response. Well, I mean, is it your sense, though, that this 6 months' post-summit period has been as hopeful as you had thought it might be, or has it, in fact, been something of a downer for you, a disappointment? Well, we did not come home with any euphoria or anything from that meeting. We did come home pleased with the fact that they had agreed and shown an agreement to have future meetings. We do not think that is been done away with. But also, we have had people over there-Charlie Wick has had people with him over there on the matter of exchange, cultural exchange and youth exchange, and all of this. And apparently they were better meetings than we have ever had in the past with them. He met with officials at extremely high levels. They were most enthusiastic about wanting to go forward with these exchanges, so-and the fact that I have a communications channel to the General Secretary. No, I think that the conditions are better than they had been before. Mr. ENTITY, the General Secretary links a summit and progress on arms control and, on the other hand, does not seem to have loosened the strings on his negotiators in Geneva. Do you think that Mr. Gorbachev really wants an arms control agreement, and do you think he really wants a summit meeting this year? I have to say his willingness and his eagerness to have us come there in the following year leads me to believe that nothing has changed on that. With regard to arms control, yes, because I think he is very much aware of the economic situation in his country and the part that their massive military buildup has played in that economic problem. And I think that he would much prefer to have practical arms agreements, arms reduction agreements, rather than to face a continued arms race. Sir, may I ask you, have you a deadline for setting the date for a summit meeting? Must it be done, for example, before you go to the economic summit meeting? No, I have not asked for that kind of a deadline. We have made it plain to them that it would be very difficult, inconvenient for us to-the one hint that was put out by them of possibly September or later-well, we have an election in our country. Now, I know they do not understand our elections as much as they should, not having free elections of their own. But we have explained that it must be earlier, before we actually get into the full extent of that election campaign. Is it at all possible that you could meet after the election? I do not -we have not -I suppose, but by that time we are getting pretty late in the year. We'd listen to that and look at it. I had not thought about anything after that time. But your preference is still June or July? Or July, yeah. Mr. ENTITY, may I ask you a question about the Strategic Defense Initiative? If some parts of it prove feasible earlier than others, would you be in favor of deploying those parts when they are feasible, such as the ground-based protection of our Minuteman and MX missiles? I'd have to seriously think about that, because I have already said, and I told General Secretary Gorbachev, that we viewed this as a defense for all of mankind and as something that could really make it possible and practical for the elimination of nuclear weapons every place. To go forward with a deployment without a lot of further meetings and exchanges would then appear that we might be seeking to get a first-strike advantage. And I think that would be the most dangerous thing in the world, for either one of us to be seen as having the capacity for a first strike. So your inclination would be to wait until the whole thing is both feasible and negotiable? Or if whatever, as you say, in part, became feasible, okay, then go earlier to both our allies and to the others and say, Look, here is the potential now for this weapon and we want it to be used for all mankind, and see what we could work out. Mr. ENTITY, one other thing, you have spoken of a proportional response to the Soviets' treaty violations as you see them. And yet you have not announced that response yet. Are we about to have it sprung on us soon? Well- - Have you decided? We have not sat down actually with regard to theirs and what our response would be. But this one, on this one, this only has to deal with the SALT II. Yes. The other thing, the nuclear test ban, this one, we are willing to meet them on that except that we cannot get a satisfactory answer yet on real verification. Now, we have offered to let them come here with whatever equipment they wanted to bring and be witness to one of our underground tests. This is a treaty where we think they have been in violation. It is rather difficult to determine from the great distance whether they have exceeded the agreement on the size of the explosion. And we would want better verification before we go forward with some of these. Well, could we be sure of the safety and reliability of our weapons if we abandon all testing, if there were a comprehensive ban? No, I think the greatest-here is where again that their proposal is unfair to us. It is in the time that they set. They are ahead of us in modernizing and expanding their weapon systems, developing new ones. We are still playing catchup. They have tested and are now deploying their modernized and their newer weapons. For us to stop where we are still playing catchup, leaves us in a position of increased inferiority to them. And it would not be fair for us until we have made the same tests comparatively with our-that they have made with their new and improved, modernized weapons. Then we could talk, but with better verification than we now have-we could talk such a test ban. Mr. ENTITY, on the space shuttle disaster, our paper had a story last week that the White House had issued a national security decision directive in 1984 which targeted 24 shuttle missions a year and operating in the black for the shuttle program. Do you believe that the kind of pressure that that put on the shuttle program could have been, in any way, responsible for what happened down there? No, and we have never done anything except to approve their schedule. They have told us what they were capable of doing, and I have put out a thing like-that we want it by a certain time down the years here, if possible to have a manned space station. And this is a program that I have announced, and they were to go after it, but we have never, ever-and I-some of those rumors that came out that we had insisted on this particular launching. We have never from here suggested or pushed them for a launch of the shuttle. I would-good Lord, I would feel that I was way out of my depth in trying to do that. I am not a scientist and they are. They are the judge of that. Immediately after this happened, you responded to your conversations with the families of some of the victims and said that you were determined that the program would go forward. In view of things that have been discovered by your commission since then, and in view of some of the statements by the astronauts themselves that they had serious reservations about the safety of the program based on what they'd learned-two things: Do you think that the public relations aspect of it in which teachers, journalists, and others would go along should be continued or curtailed under those circumstances? Well, we want the program. When I responded to the-I responded to the families. Every family, those people that I talked to, in their conversation, they made it plain to me that they felt this program had to continue; that this was what their loved ones, now departed, would have wanted. And they wanted me to tell them, and I told them, yes, it will. Yes, we have no intention of canceling the program because of this tragedy. You know, when you look at it, you have 24 times right and i accident, i wrong-you cannot cancel out the program. But I have also said since, and we have all agreed here, that now that these things are coming out, that the program must rectify all these shortcomings that had never before been mentioned so that we know that the safety factor that should be there is there. Well, do you think that those civilians should still be allowed to, considering all that? Oh, yes, you asked about that. Yes. You know, from the very beginning-almost the very beginning, once we established that it was practical-there have been people up there conducting experiments-scientists, for example, who are not astronauts, but who are there to carry on the great advances that have come to us by way of those shuttle experiments-in medicine and other things-are so great that I do not see any reason why this policy should not continue. And so you think that teachers and journalists and those should go, too? I think that all of them-you have to look at each one to see, does it have some value or is it just publicity? Everything that is been done so far, there seemed to be a logical value in this. You know, here we have a privately supported junior astronaut program in our country that is become quite a feature of our educational system and all. And so, I think you could-I think the teacher thing had a value. But I think that every case should be looked at as to what was the possible value of having a civilian along. But I do not think we should just blanket it that only astronauts are going up there to loose satellites and do things of that kind. The experiments that can be conducted and the things that we have learned from that program, things that have to do with heart ailments, the possibility that we now have of a medicine for the first time to cure diabetes that can only be produced in outer space. Well, do you think we should build a new shuttle to replace Challenger or lay off some of those assignments on unmanned missions? I have not had a chance to talk with the people involved there about three and what the difference would be between three and four myself. And I would be more or less inclined to go by the information that they might have as to what would be the setback in having 25 percent of the flying force eliminated. Could I just-you could use the word shortcomings, Mr. ENTITY, you said shortcomings that have come out in the course of this investigation. Is it your feeling at this point now, after having seen what has evolved in the course of the Presidential Commission's study that in fact there were shortcomings in the way that NASA has handled this particular I think I am going to-all I know are the things that we keep hearing about. I am going to have to wait until I actually hear from the Commission and their evaluation of what they have learned and the fact that astronauts have said there were other potential liabilities that they had become aware of. Let us read out on all of those. We do know now that, while we are still waiting to have it actually declared what was the cause of this tragedy, we still know that the rings on those two particular rockets are affected by cold. Experiments have revealed that. So, whether that turns out to be the ultimate cause or not, it ought to be something that we find an answer to. It does appear, though, that what is transpired in the aftermath of the tragedy has been concern on your part about procedures, if not knowing for sure, but concern, is that true? Yeah. I would-I think what-or as far as anyone can know, you know. There is a limit beyond which you cannot go. Anyone who gets in an airplane knows that, that there are things that can happen. Mr. ENTITY, thank you for your time, sir. Well, thank you. I think I will leave that to you, or I am going to tear my - Linda Chavez Mr. ENTITY, are you going to make it over to Maryland to campaign for your former staffer, Linda Chavez? Well, she- with the nomination first. Oh- -get you into that. No, I cannot participate in primaries. Thanks a lot. I did have to ask this last question: Have you ever sent out for Chinese food in this place? I have always wanted.- No. Have you ever wanted to?

{"id": 227, "text": "ENTITY, thanks so much for talking to us again. Great to see you again. So let me start with a report today. In an interview you said America does not torture, however, the Senate report clearly confirms that we did torture many detainees after 9/11 during the Bh Administration: Rectal feedings, broken legs, near drownings, dying of hypothermia. Are we in danger right now of an attack either at home or abroad becae of this report? Well, let me unpack that question. First of all, I did not say we did not torture. What I said was You said, America does not torture. Well, what I said was once I banned these enhanced interrogation techniques, which I had said were torture, that is not something we are going to be doing moving forward after I had issued that edict. But unfortunately, as the Senate report shows, we engaged in some brutal activity after 9/11, and, you know, this is an accounting of some of the problems that the CIA program engaged in. I recognize that there is controversies in terms of some of the details, but what is not controversial is the fact that we did some things that violated who we are as a people. And I know that there have been concerns about the release of this report and the potential dangers it poses. We have taken precautionary measures in our embassies and around the world. There is never a perfect time to release a report like this, but it was important for , I think, to recognize that part of what sets apart is when we do something wrong, we acknowledge it. The CIA cannot act alone. Is this the responsibility of President Bh? Did he betray American values? Well, as I have said before, after 9/11, I do not think that you can know what it feels like to know that America's gone through the worst attack on the continental United States in its history. And you are uncertain as to what is coming next. So there were a lot of people who did a lot of things right and worked very hard to keep safe, but I think that any fair-minded person looking at this would say that some terrible mistakes were made in allowing these kinds of practices to take place. In part becae, I think, study after study has shown that when people get tortured, when people are beaten, when people are put in a position of severe stress and pain, oftentimes they are willing to say anything to alleviate that stress and pain. So the information we get is not necessary better than doing things the right way, and my goal is to make sure, having banned this practice as one of the first things I did when I came into office, that we do not make that mistake again. But we have to recognize that when we are under threat and we are afraid and the public is clamoring to do something, that is when we have to be most on guard, becae, you know, there are times where we can slip into the kinds of activities that I do not think we want to see repeated. Can you categorically say that your Government has not tortured anyone, including those detainees in Guantanamo? I can categorically say that anybody who engaged in any behavior like this would be directly violating my executive orders and my policies as ENTITY and would be held into account and would be breaking the law. On another issue, the killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, clearly shows that we do not live in a post-racial society as many expected when you were elected. Well, I did not expect that. You probably did not either, but But many people expected you probably to do more on race relations, dealing with white privilege. Do you get angry with this? Well, you know, I Is it your responsibility? I think that if you look at the history of race in America, it is ually not a single moment when suddenly everything gets solved. It is a process. I think that becae of our policies there is more equality than when I came in, with respect to healthcare, with respect to access to college, with respect to opportunity. I think becae of the work that Eric Holder has done under my direction. The criminal So we are doing better on race? I think the Criminal Jtice System is improved. I think that if you talk to younger people, your daughter, my daughters, their attitudes absolutely are better when it comes to race. Eric Garner, and they see Trayvon Martin, and they say Yeah. there is not really a lot of improvement. Well, but, you know, the folks who say there is not a lot improvement I do not think were living in the '50s and remember what it was like to be black or Hispanic and interacting with the police then. They do not even remember what it was like 20 years ago. There has been improvement. The question is what more do we need to do, and what is clear, when you look at some of the reports that have occurred around the country, is that not only is there still a lot of spicion and mistrt between police officers and communities of color. But what is also true is that there are still instances in which a young black boy or brown boy is not being evaluated, in terms of risk, precisely in the same way as a white young person might be by the police. Now, that can be solved through better training, better accountability, better transparency, and so the task force we have put together is designed to do precisely this. But I think it is important to realize that even as we ph to get on top of these issues around the country, and nobody's going to be phing harder than me becae I have been subjected to these kinds of misperceptions in the past, that You have been discriminated? Of course, you know, I think it'd be pretty hard to grow up in the United States of America without having any experiences of discrimination, but what I do know is in my life things have improved, and they are going to continue to improve. And so we have to recognize that issues of racial prejudice and discrimination, they are embedded deeply in society, and they do not transform overnight, but each successive generation, what we have seen in America is we have seen improvement. And I am confident that if we are foced on it and are willing to talk about these honestly, ten years from now things will be better and twenty years from now even better than that. ENTITY, let me ask you about immigration. Seventeen governors filed a lawsuit against you trying to block your executive decision Yeah. on immigration. They say, and I will quote, that you are abdicating your responsibility to faithfully enforce the laws and that you are violating your Constitutional duty. Are you concerned about being impeached? No, becae what we have done is not only lawful, based on the evaluations of the Office of Legal Counsel, but is of the same type of action that was taken by every Democratic and Republican president over the last 20, 30 years. I understand that. But many times you said that you did not have the legal authority to go ahead you said, I am not the king. I am not the emperor of the United States. Yeah. Even on March 2011 on a Univision town hall meeting you told , and I quote, With respect to the notion that I can jt spend deportations through executive order, that is jt not the case. That is exactly what you did. No, no, no. Why did you change your mind? No, becae, ENTITY, at the time, and I can run back the tape on your questions and some of the questions of that town hall, the notion was that we could jt stop deportations period, and we cannot do that. What I have said very clearly, consistently is that we have to enforce our immigration laws, but that we have prosecutorial discretion given the limited resources, and we cannot deport 11 million people. So it is not that you changed your mind on this? What was Or that you were convinced otherwise? what was clear was that we could reprioritize how we deploy the limited resources we have to foc on the borders, to foc on criminals. We began that process as soon as I came into office. We amplified that approach through the DACA program that we instituted, and then we continued to see what else we could do. And Jay Johnson, I think, has done a terrific job in saying, here are our priorities. We are not going to separate families. We are going to focus on criminals. We are going to focus on borders. We are going to focus on new arrivals. Because one of the things that I think is important to understand is that although we are reprioritizing to make sure that we are not in the business of separating families, we are still sending a message to people who have not yet come here, we are going to be enforcing those immigration laws so that newcomers, people who just arrived, you are likely to be sent back. And we are going to still be focused on making sure that, not just from Mexico but anywhere around the world, that we can actually enforce better the laws that we have. In the meantime, the people who have lived here, let us make sure that they are treated as the members of our community that they truly are. But if you as you were saying, you always had the legal authority to stop deportations, then why did you deport two million people? ENTITY, we are not going to For six years you did it. No. Listen, ENTITY You destroyed many families. They called you deporter-in-chief. You called me deporter-in-chief. It was Janet Murguia from La Raza. Yeah, but let me say this, ENTITY Well, you could have stopped deportations. No, no, no. That is the whole idea. That is not true. Listen, here is the fact of the matter. You could have stopped them. ENTITY, here is the fact of the matter. As ENTITY I am always responsible for problems that are not solved right away. I regret millions of people who did not get health insurance before I passed health insurance and before I implemented it. I regret the fact that there are kids who should've been going to college during my presidency, but because we did not get to them fast enough, they gave up on college. The question is, are we doing the right thing, and have we consistently tried to move this country in a better direction. And those, like you sometimes, ENTITY, who suggests that there are simple quick answers to these problems, I think I never said that though. Yes, you do, because that is how you present it, and I think when you when you present it But you had the authority when you present it in that way, it does a disservice, because it makes the assumption that the political process is one that can easily be moved around, depending on the will of one person and that is now how things work. What I am just saying We spent that entire time trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill done that would solve the problem for all the people. So right now, by the actions that I have taken, I still have five million people who do not have the ability to get registered and be confident that they are not deported. In fact, what is going to happen, sometime over the next two days, week, month is that that they are going to be some folks who are still caught up in the system because we have to go and train ICE workers so that they are responding in a different way. And so the question I have for you, ENTITY, because you are going to have a big voice, is are you going to do a good job in, now that we have taken these actions, making sure that people understand what their opportunities are, how we can take advantage of it, and how we can build to make sure that going forward, not only as many people register as possible, if you have been here for five years, if you have a child who is an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, that you are likely to end up signing up so that we build up that capacity, and we lay the groundwork for passing comprehensive immigration reform. Because if we do not do that, then it is true that there are going to be a whole bunch of folks who try to push back, and this is necessarily a temporary measure designed to help as many people as we can right now, but we have still got a big fight that we are going to have to take in the future. I could continued on immigration, but You could Yeah. and I'd be happy to do it, but you are probably running out of time. We are, right, yeah, so I have like two or three minutes. Go ahead. So let me just go with another issue. On Cuba, the fifth anniversary of the arrest of Alan Gross in Cuba, are you making efforts towards his release? Is there going to be a prisoner swap with the three Cuban spies being held in Miami? You know we have been in conversations about how we can get Alan Gross home for quite some time. With the Cuban government? We have been working through a whole variety of channels. We continue to be concerned about him. We think that he should not have been held in the first place. With respect to Cuba, generally, I have made very clear that the policies that we have in making remittances easier for Cuban families and making it easier for families to travel, have been helpful to people inside of Cuba, but the Cuban government still needs to make significant changes. Beyond that, I do not have any announcements. All right. Bill Cosby has been lately in the news because of rape accusations. What is the best way to deal with something like this right now? Well, I think that it is important to not focus on one case, but to focus on the broader concerns that I have about how women, and sometimes men, are subjected to sexual assaults. And that is been true in our military, that is true in our colleges and universities. We are focused at the White House on making sure that we are raising awareness. Part of it is passing laws, but part of it is also changing minds and culture. Not only to make it safe for those who've been assaulted to come forward, but also to change the mindset of men, particularly our young men who are coming up, so that they understand that no means no, that respect for women and individuals is what makes you strong. That is an ongoing process, sort of like the process we talked about with respect to race. Politics can change policy. It can change laws. It can change law enforcement. And it then combines with changes in culture and perceptions and over time we make progress. You know, Dr. King said once that, The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. And, you know, I am a big believer in the notion that even though sometimes history moves backwards, sometimes it moves sideways, that if people of goodwill keep pushing, eventually we have a more just society. And that is , you know, hopefully, part of my role as ENTITY and that'll be part of your role as a journalist. I hope so. Okay. ENTITY, thanks so much. Enjoyed it. Thank you.

{"id": 450, "text": "Why has it been so easy for critics to say the administration does not have its story straight on Benghazi? Well, look, the fact of the matter is that this is a tragedy. There is all kinds of legitimate questions to ask because anytime a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans who were serving our country get killed, we have to figure out what happened, and fix it. And most importantly, we have got to bring those folks who carried that out to justice. That is exactly what we are going to do. But I do take offense, as I have said at one of the debates, with some suggestion that in any way, we have not tried to make sure that the American people knew, as information was coming in what we believed happened. And- Was it the intel community that gave you bad information early on? That-that Because the story keeps changing. Well, that is what we are going to find out from the investigation. But the truth is that across the board, when this happened, my number 1 priority was, secure Americans, figure out what happened, bring those folks to justice. We are in the process of doing that right now. Congress has been getting the flow of information continuously from day 1. And what my attitude on this is, if we find out we that there was a big breakdown, and somebody did not do their job, they will be held accountable. Ultimately, as commander-in-chief, I am responsible, and I do not shy away from that responsibility. My number 1 responsibility is to go after the folks who did this, and we are going to make sure we get them. I have got a pretty good track record of doing that. So, how do you feel? It is like - you got to be excited. I am excited. But at the same time, it is like Dr. J, when he went around, you only have 9 more days to do this. Well, we are going to be campaigning as hard as we can. One of the things that happens at this point is - it is just kinetic energy. You are just running, and you just want to make sure that your voters are enthusiastic, that you are getting your message out in a clear and concise way. Right. And... Why did you look at me when you said concise? Because ENTITY because ENTITY, exactly... Because some people accuse ENTITY of maybe not being clear enough about the next four years. I do not know who would do that. Not me. Well, but it is also, you know - in rallies like this, at this point, what people just want to know is not every point on every plan. What they want to know what is the vision that you have got for the country, and the good news is, I am feeling very optimistic about the next four years. I think the country is bouncing back, as we always do from tough times. Right. I want to make sure that I lead over these next four years. But, this is though. When I say that this is like Dr. J, you know. He went around last year, and it is bittersweet. It is. This has to be bittersweet for you. 'Cause I saw you out there, and I thought, Oh my god. This guy is not going to be doing this again, after and then, you are going to have to be like Bill Clinton and find other people to campaign... It is true. It has to be bittersweet for you. Well, you get a little nostalgic. I mean, you start thinking about your first campaign. I was thinking about my first campaign, when I was running for state senate. Right. We had like four volunteers around the kitchen table, designing our own flier, taking it over to Kinko's, you know? And now, I am not going to be doing this much longer. And you know, the nice thing is though, the energy, the crowds that we have seen, makes me feel as if we are running this campaign in the right way. We are ending strong, and I think we are going to do well. So, let us talk about the next 4 years, and try and get specific as possible. What is- How would you define your mandate for the next four years? And what is ? I'd like to know the sacrifice that will not be asked of just the 1% but of the 99% as well? Well, there is no doubt that our first order of business is going to be to get our deficits and debt under control. And the good thing is that there is a forcing mechanism. You know, the Bush tax cuts end at the end of the year. We know that we have got the sequester looming. That would not be the right way to do things, that is taking a machete to something, as opposed to a scalpel, and after the election, I think that both Democrats and Republicans have to step back and say, You know what, this is something that the country wants to solve. If I have won, then I believe that is a mandate for doing it in a balanced way. We have already made a trillion dollars worth of cuts. We can do some more cuts. We can look at how we deal with the health care costs in particular under Medicaid and Medicare in a serious way, but we are also going to need some revenue. If we get that piece done, and we kind of settle on the big question, how much government are we going to have, and how are we going to pay for it? Then, a lot of the other stuff falls into place. Can you get Medicare done? Because... I think we can. Because Republicans demagogue it. Democrats demagogue it. Everyone's demagogued it through the years. Can you go to the Republicans, and say, Guys, wait a minute, we got to do this together? Well, look, here is what we can do. I mean, look, I am on record. I think turning it into a voucher, premium support is a bad idea. I do think though that anybody realistically looks at it and says, you know, if we are spending 17% of our GDP on health care, and every other country is spending 11%, and their outcomes are better, that difference is 6%, that is our deficit and our debt, and so, let us find good ideas. Now, I stole a whole bunch of ideas from a Massachusetts governor that I think over time is going to save us money, and you know, part-the $716 billion dollars that Governor Romney suggests that I stole from Medicare is actually money that we are saving in the system, and extending the life of Medicare, so I think there are ways that we can do this in a creative way, but if we get that piece done, then, immigration reform, I think is there to get done. And I think your side is going to need to get it done because you cannot continue to alienate the fastest growing segment of the country, and it is the right thing to do. I think that infrastructure, ENTITY, when you were in Congress, since when did roads and bridges become Democratic issues? Those have been historically Democratic and Republican issues. A guy named Ike kind of liked infrastructure, did not he? But the thing is, we got a whole bunch of deferred maintenance. Interest rates are low. Contractors are begging for work ? Putting folks back to work right now as part of an overall package, This has also got long term deficit reduction, can jumpstart the economy, at the same time that housing is starting to recover. And the education agenda that I have got is one that even Jeb Bush has occasionally complimented, because you know, we have said, you cannot just give more money into a system without reforming it, and there is got to be a lot more accountability. So, there are a whole range of issues, I think where we can actually bring the country together, with a non-ideological agenda, the question's going to be: How do Republicans react in Congress post-election? Because there is going to be a war going on inside that party. It just has not broken out. It is been unified, in opposition to me. So, let us say you win. Yeah. Boehner still is Speaker, and the House goes either Democratic or Republican by 1. You are still in the same situation in the next four years, you were in the last four years. So, what is going to make the difference. We have talked about this to you, one-on-one before, what makes the difference over the next 4 years? What is there for Americans to hope and believe that Republicans and Democrats can work together? I truly believe that if we can get the deficit and debt issue solved, which I believe we can get done, you know, in the lame duck, or in the immediate aftermath, of the lame duck, then that clears away a lot of the ideological underbrush. And then, you know, now, we can start looking at a whole bunch of other issues, as I have said has historically not been that ideological. Let us take an example. You know, Republicans say that I have over-regulated. Now, the truth is, I put out fewer regulations than George Bush did. Some were significant. Obviously, Dodd-Frank, welfare reform, Wall Street reform is a big example of that. But I have actually initiated a whole process to look back at all the old regulations to see, are there ones that do not work? That should be a project Republicans are happy to work with me on, because you know, if we are going to streamline government, we are going to do it smartly. I have said I want to consolidate a whole bunch of government agencies. We should have one Secretary of Business, instead of nine different departments that are dealing with things like getting loans to SBA or helping companies with exports. There should be a one-stop shop. Now, the reason we have not done that is not because of some big ideological difference. It has something to do with Congress talking a good game about streamlining government, but protective about giving up their jurisdiction over various pieces of government. So, there are going to be a whole things of government that I think we can work on, the first thing though is, let us go ahead and get settled, how big a government, how do we pay for it? If we solve that problem, and I think we can solve it, and we have to solve it, then, I think we will be in a position to make some progress in the last four...", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmikabrzezinskiandjoescarboroughmsnbc", "title": "Interview with Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough of MSNBC", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mika-brzezinski-and-joe-scarborough-msnbc", "publication_date": "29-10-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 375, "text": "I want to thank Director Goss for his hospitality. It was such a pleasure to come out and see hundreds of folks who work here at the Central Intelligence Agency. I came for a couple of reasons. One, I wanted to assure the people here that their contribution was incredibly vital to the security of the United States and that, together, we have achieved a lot in securing this country. There is a lot of really incredibly bright, capable, hard-working, dedicated Americans who work in this building. So my first mission was to thank them. And the second thing was to explain that the reforms that we will be implementing through the good graces of Ambassador Negroponte, if confirmed by the Senate, will actually help the CIA do its job better. And I got a great reception. I want to thank you, again, Director, for your hospitality. We are making progress in the war on terror. The world is changing. And this country of ours will continue to do our duty, which is to find terrorists, bring them to justice through good intelligence and hard work and some brave souls, and at the same time, work to spread freedom and liberty around the world. I will answer a couple of questions. ENTITY. ENTITY, your CIA Director, Mr. Goss, said yesterday that he has to wear five hats now and that he was concerned there were some ambiguities in the new arrangement about his relationship with Mr. Negroponte and Secretary Rumsfeld. Do you feel there are such ambiguities, and will you move to-if there are, will you move to clear them up? And will this prevent-will this present a problem for the flow of intelligence in this time, this transition period? That is an excellent question. Porter and I have discussed this, of course, because I do not want there to be any interruption of intelligence coming to the White House, and there will not be. As a matter of fact, Porter Goss comes every morning with the CIA briefer to deliver the briefing. And that, of course, will go on. And it is -secondly, we do not even have Ambassador Negroponte confirmed yet. In other words, it is hard to implement reforms without somebody to be the reformer. And so the process is ongoing. Obviously, when his name gets up to the Senate, we hope there is a speedy confirmation. But one of the purposes of the whole process, ENTITY, is to make sure that information flows are smooth and that efforts are coordinated. The CIA is the Central Intelligence Agency; it is the center of the intelligence community. But there is a lot of other intelligence gathering operations around Government. And the job of Ambassador Negroponte is to be-to take the information and make sure it is coordinated in its distribution to not only the White House but to key players in my administration. And so I am confident that the process will work. Obviously, one of the reasons I came here is because I know there is some uncertainty about what this reform means to the people of the CIA, and I wanted to assure them that the reforms will strengthen their efforts and make it easier for them to do their job, not harder. I am glad I came out. ENTITY, on Social Security reform, what is your judgment about where this process stands right now, with polls showing the public skeptical; some Republicans, like Senator Grassley, are seeming to back away from your proposal; and Democrats wanting to declare it dead. I would say this: I am- know we are at the early stages of the process. I have only had nine trips around the country so far-or nine States on my trips. I have got a lot more work to do. Now, I do believe we are making progress on the first stage of getting anything complicated and difficult done in Washington, and that is to explain the problem. And the surveys I have seen, at least, say that the American people understand we have a problem. And I am going to continue going out to explain that to people, the nature of the problem. And the problem is, in 2018, the system starts losing money. In 2027, it is 200 billion in the hole, and it gets bigger every year thereafter. In other words, we cannot pay for the promises we have made. That is the problem. And my second phase of this explanation to the American people is to say to seniors who have retired or people near retirement, you do not have anything to worry about; you are going to get your check. I have got a lot of work to do on that, and I understand that. But we are making progress. People are beginning to say, We have a problem. The next phase, when people say we have a problem, is going to be, What are you going to do about it? And I am willing to put out some ideas about what to do about it. In my judgment, ultimately, I think politicians need to be worried about not being a part of the solution. And so I am looking forward to continue to make the case. As you know, ENTITY- you have followed me a lot-I like to get out amongst the people. I get energized- I get energized by being with people, and I get energized when I think about taking on big problems, because that is why we got elected. The American people expect people to come together to solve problems. And I am looking forward to listening to Republicans and Democrats. I said, Put your ideas out there. There will be no political third rail when it comes to Social Security. Now is the time for good people of good will to come together and get the problem fixed. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that a consumption tax, maybe even a national sales tax, might spur greater economic growth. What do you think about that? I think that I am going to wait until the tax commission I put together, the reform commission headed by former Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, former Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, comes forward with some ideas. I told the American people I want to work to simplify the Tax Code and make it easier to understand, so people are spending less time filing paper, and I believe a simplified Tax Code will spur entrepreneurial activity. And so I am looking forward to what the commission has to say. You mentioned Usama bin Laden earlier this morning, and you have said several times that there is progress being made on the war on terrorism. But more than 3 years after September 11th, you still do not know where he is. How would you assess the adequacy of the intelligence you are getting on bin Laden, and do you expect that he is going to be found any time soon, even within your second term? If Al Qaida was structured like corporate America, you'd have a chairman of the board still in office, but many of the key operators would no longer be around. In other words, the executive vice presidents, the operating officers, the people responsible for certain aspects of the organization have been brought to justice- a lot of them have been. And we are- spend every day gathering information to locate Usama bin Laden and Zawahiri, obviously people like Zarqawi. We are not resting on our laurels. We have had great successes, and-but that does not mean that we should stop. And one of the reasons I came out here was to remind people that we have had great successes. I appreciate their successes- Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh. I can go down the list. But there is more work to be done. And it is a matter of time. As far as I am concerned and as far as the CIA is concerned, it is a matter of time before we bring these people to justice. And I cannot thank the intelligence gatherers, the analysts, and the operators- I cannot thank them enough for the sacrifices they are making. Last question. ENTITY, on Iran, you spoke to Condoleezza Rice yesterday, we were told. What can you tell us about the pros and cons that you are weighing now as you reach a decision on going forward with the EU? Yes, let me just tell you how I see the state of action here. First, I am most appreciative that our friends in Europe agree with the United States that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon, period-no ands, ifs, or buts. And I thought that was a very important statement from the leaders I met with. And by the way, Mr. Putin feels the same way. And to me that is a very-a positive start for achieving our common objective. First, you got to agree to the goal, and the goal is no weapon. Secondly, I have told our European friends who are handling the negotiations on behalf of the rest of the world that we want to help make sure the process goes forward. And we are looking at ways to help move the process forward. The guilty party is Iran. They are the ones who are not living up to international accords. They are the people that the whole world is saying, Do not develop a weapon. And so we are working with our friends to make sure not only the world hears that but that the negotiating strategy achieves the objective of pointing out where guilt needs to be as well as achieving the objective of no nuclear weapon. And I felt good about our visits. I did visit with Condi yesterday, and I am about to go visit with her again in the Oval Office to discuss not only this issue but other key issues, including Lebanon, where the message is loud and clear from the United States and France and many other nations that Syria must withdraw not only her troops but her secret service forces out of Lebanon now. And I look forward to talking to Condi about getting an amplification on her visit with our allies overseas. I look forward to not only hear their words; I want to hear about their body language. I want to hear about their enthusiasm for the project. I think I am going to find it was quite high because the people now understand that if you believe in democracy, why not let the democracy in Lebanon flourish and grow? And the United States of America strongly supports democracy all around the world, including Lebanon. And it cannot flourish so long as Syrian troops are there. It is time for Syria to get out. Listen, thank you all.

{"id": 453, "text": "Mr. ENTITY, your interest in Basketball has been well documented, in that there are a few things going on in your world everyday, how often do you get to come out here and play? Well, these days I probably play once every two to three weeks. Not as often as I like, but during say, the Health Care Debate, when things are just, you know, going crazy over on Capitol Hill, a lot of times I will just come out here and shoot or I will play a game of HORSE it takes an edge off things. Now these days when you are involved in Pick-Up games, do you feel that you are dealing with less physical contact since you became ENTITY? Well it is true I usually have guys with guns around. Yeah, I noticed. The So, if somebody, you know, takes a real hard fall -- foul, they could get in trouble. Nobody ever lets me with because if you let me win, you will never hear the end of it. I will talk a little trash about you. I will make you feel bad about yourself if we beat you real bad. Now, I am assuming that Bowling is not on the schedule? The You know, my bowling has greatly improved. So Marv, you are touching on a slightly sensitive point. I am not going to walk off the set here but, we do have a bowling alley here at the White House and I have gotten a lot better. Now do you find yourself, as we all have back in the day on the playground, doing play-by-play to yourself? You come out here, maybe count it down. For example the game is tied -- The In the back of my mind, ENTITY is making the call. So, it is Obama with the ball. Top of the key, three seconds left... Unleashes for three. Yes! The I have your voice in my head as I am shooting the three. That is sad. Now I know you do not want to be accused of tampering for your Bulls but, any advice that you might have, for LeBron James as he approaches free agency? The I think that the most important thing for LeBron right now is actually to find a structure where he is got a coach that he respects and is working hard with teammates who care about him and if that is in Cleveland, then he should stay in Cleveland. If he does not feel like he can get it there, then someplace else. The one thing I remember about the Bulls was it was not until Michael had confidence in Phil Jackson, Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant; it was not until you got that framework around you that you could be a champion. Same thing happened with Kobe. First with Shaq then later with Gasol, you know, he is gotten that sense of a team around him and I think LeBron has not quite been able to get that yet; that is what he needs to find. Could you, on behalf of the Bulls, throw in perhaps a night in the Lincoln Bedroom or ride on Air Force One? You know, like I said, I do not want to mettle. I will say this, Rose, Noah -- It is a pretty good core. It is a pretty good core. You know, you could see LeBron fitting in pretty well. If you were NBA Commissioner for a day, what changes would you make? You know, I will be honest with you, I think the game is in a good place right now. The way they are calling the game right now returns basketball to where its supposed to be; more of a finesse game. The biggest change I'd probably propose right now is, the commissioner needs to figure out how to price tickets so that ordinary people can go to the games. I mean I think that ticket prices have gotten so high, and I understand that salaries are high, ticket prices are going to be high but, you know, you hate to think that the only person that can go to a game is somebody who is got a corporate account. And that is something that I'd love all professional sports, that is not just NBA, but all professional sports to be thinking about a little more. Alright the Phoenix Suns, in the news recently wearing the Los Suns jerseys on Cinco de Mayo. And they took a stand opposing Arizona's immigration policy, how do you feel about sports franchises getting involved in political issues? You know, I think that just because somebody's a sports figure or you got a sports team does not mean that you are not part of the community and you are not part of our democracy. I think it is terrific that the Suns, who obviously feel very strong about their community, recognize that a big part of their community felt threatened by this new law. You know, when I was growing up, you had figures like Arthur Ashe and Bill Russell who routinely would talk about the world around them. You would not always agree with them but, that sense that, you know, people are engaged in the big issues of the day, I think is a positive thing and I do not think that either players or franchises need to always steer away from controversy. I happen to personally think that the Arizona Law is a bad idea, I have said so publicly and I see no reason why these guys cannot make the same statement. Here in Washington, it is a great deal of excitement. Wizards, now in possession of the overall first round pick. John Wall of Kentucky would be, I would guess, the early line favorite. What is your, I know you watch a lot of college basketball, what is your scouting report? Wall is a terrific player. I mean, you know, he is got the NBA speed, NBA body, great jump shot, unselfish, really impressive. There is only upside for that kid. And I think it'd be great for him to come to Washington. I became very close to Abe Pollin, who was a great supporter, he and wife. He just passes away recently but there is an example of a guy who constantly gave back to his community. I mean, almost single-handedly, he invested in downtown Washington at a time when it was in really bad shape. You know, generated huge affection in this city and it was wonderful to see his widow there; getting that number one pick and I only wish the best for that franchise. What is the Presidential pick for this season's NBA Champions? The Boston surprised me. They gelled in the playoffs in a way that they had not all through the season. Rondo's become one of the best point guards in the league in no time. I mean, when he gets a real jump shot, he is going to be unstoppable but I have got to go with the Lakers again. I think Gasol may be the best big man in the league right now. He is different from Dwight Howard but he is playing -- Great footwork. -- unbelievable footwork. Speed savvy, he is playing magnificently. Kobe is, you know, the fiercest competitor in the league and they have got, you know, what I continue to believe is the best coach in the NBA right now in Phil Jackson so there going to be formidable and I think it'll be a tough series. You know, Boston's a veteran club but the Lakers are looking pretty good. Mr. ENTITY, we appreciate your taking the time and I really like your back yard. Listen, you are welcome, Marv, to call play-by-play in any pick up game that we have. I want you to let Kenny know and Charles know, that I appreciate them. And I am curious about Charles' golf game though. I want to see if that swing ever got fixed. A lot of people are curious about that. Charles is a great guy, great friend but that is , it is a scary golf swing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarvalbertturnernetworktelevisiontnt", "title": "Interview With Marv Albert of Turner Network Television (TNT)", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-marv-albert-turner-network-television-tnt", "publication_date": "22-05-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 349, "text": "Were you surprised by the intensity of the reaction, and the hostility from the AIG bonus debacle? I was not surprised by it. Our team was not surprised by it. The one thing that I have tried to emphasize, though, throughout this week, and will continue to try to emphasize during the course of the next several months as we dig ourselves out of the economic hole that we are in, is we cannot govern out of anger. We have got to try to make good decisions based on the facts, in order to put people back to work, to get credit flowing again. And I am not going to be distracted by what is happening day to day. I have gotta stay focused on making sure that we are getting this economy moving again. I mean you are a constitutional law professor. Yeah. You think this bill's constitutional? Well, I think that as a general proposition, you do not want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals. You want to pass laws that have some broad applicability. And as a general proposition, I think you certainly do not want to use the tax code to punish people. I think that you have got a pretty egregious situation here that people are understandably upset about. And so let us see if there are ways of doing this that are both legal, that are constitutional that uphold our basic principles of fairness, but do not hamper us from getting the banking system back on track. You have got a piece of legislation that could affect tens of thousands of people. Some of these people probably had nothing to do with the financial crisis. And some of them probably deserve the bonuses that they got. Well... I mean is that fair? Well, that is why we are going to have to take a look at this legislation carefully. Clearly the AIG folks getting those bonuses did not make sense. And one of the things that I have to do is to communicate to Wall Street that, given the current crisis that we are in, they cannot expect help from taxpayers but they enjoy all the benefits that they enjoyed before the crisis happened. You get a sense that, in some institutions that has not sunk in. That you cannot go back to the old way of doing business, certainly not on the taxpayers' dime. Now the flip side is that Main Street has to understand, unless we get these banks moving again, then we cannot get this economy to recover. And we do not want to cut off our nose to spite our face. Your Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has been under a lot of pressure this week. And there have been people in Congress calling for his head. Yeah. Have there been discussions in the White House about replacing him? No. Has he volunteered to, or come to you and said, Do you think I should step down? No. And and he should not . And if he were to come to me, I'd say, Sorry, Buddy. You you have still got the job. But look. He is got a lot of stuff on his plate. And he is doing a terrific job. And I take responsibility for not, I think, having given him as much help as he needs. You know, this whole confirmation process, as I mentioned earlier has gotten pretty tough. It is been always tough. It is gotten tougher in the age of 24-7 news cycles. And a lot of people who we think are about to serve in the administration and Treasury suddenly say, Well, you know what? I do not want to go through some of the scrutiny, embarrassment, in addition to taking huge cuts in pay. Have you offered some of these high level positions the Treasury to people who would have turned them down? Absolutely. Yeah. And and not because people did not want to serve. I think that people just felt that, you know, that the process has gotten very onerous. Your Treasury Secretary's plan... Geithner's plan, and -- your plan really -- for solving the banking crisis -- was met with very, very, very tepid response. And you had a lot of people criticize...a lot of people said they did not understand it. A lot of people said it did not have any -- enough details to solve the problem. I know you are coming out with something next week on this. But these criticisms were coming from people like Warren Buffett, people who had supported you, and you had counted as being your... And nd Warren still does support me. But I think that understand Warren's also a big player in the financial markets who is a major owner of Wells Fargo. And so he is got a perspective from the perspective of somebody who is part owner of a bank. You have got members of Congress who've got a different perspective. Which is, We do not want to spend any more taxpayer money. You have got a whole host of players, all of whom may have a completely different solution. Right? And you know, one of the challenges that Tim Geithner has had is the same challenge that anybody would have in this situation. People want a lot of contradictory things. You know, the banks would love a lot of taxpayer money with no strings attached. Folks in Congress, as well as the American people, would love to fix the banks without spending any money. And so at a certain point, you know, you have got just a very difficult line to walk. You need the financial community... Right. ...to solve this crisis. I do. Do you think that the people on Wall Street and the people in the financial community that you need trust you, believe in you? Part of my job is to communicate to them, Look, I believe in the market. I believe in financial innovation. And I believe in success. I want them to do well. But what I also know is that the financial sector was out of balance. You look at how finance used to operate just 20 years ago, or 25 years ago. People, if you went into investment banking, you were making 20 times what a teacher made. You were not making 200 times what a teacher made. There is a perception right now, at least in New York, which is where I live and work. Right. That, um, people feel they thought that you were going to be supportive. And now I think there are a lot of people say, Look, we are not going to be able to keep our best people. They are not going to stay and work here for $250,000 a year when they can go work for a hedge fund, if they can find one that is still working-- Well, that-- that-- and make a lot more. I have told them directly. 'Cause I have heard some of this. they need to spend a little time outside of New York. Because you know, if you go to North Dakota, or you go to Iowa, or you go to Arkansas, where folks would be thrilled to be making $75,000 a year -- without a bonus -- then I think they'd get a sense of why people are frustrated. I think we have to understand the severity of the crisis that we are in right now. The fact is that, because of bad bets made on Wall Street, there have been enormous losses. I mean there were a whole bunch of folks who, on paper, if you looked at quarterly reports, were wildly successful, selling derivatives that turned out to be... Worthless. Completely worthless. And insuring them. And insuring them. Now you know, gosh, I do not think it is me being anti-Wall Street just to point out that the best and the brightest did not do too well on that front, and that you know, maybe the incentive structures that have been set up have not produced the kinds of long term growth that I think everybody's looking for. Were you surprised at the depth of this recession when you got here? Did you know it was this bad? I do not think that we anticipated how steep the decline would be, particularly in employment. I mean if you look at just, you know, hundreds of thousands, now millions of jobs being shed over the course of two months -- or three months, that slope is a lot steeper than anything that we have said -- we have seen before. Now, there is a potential silver lining, which may be that things are so accelerated now, the modern economy is so intertwined and wired, that things happen really fast for ill, but things may recover faster than they have in the past. Do you believe that there is still some systemic risk out there? That the financial system could still implode if you had a big failure at AIG or at Citicorp? Yes. Citibank? I think that systemic risks are still out there. And if we did nothing you could still have some big problems. There are certain institutions that are so big that if they fail, they bring a lot of other financial institutions down with them. And if all those financial institutions fail all at the same time, then you could see an even more destructive recession and potentially depression. I am optimistic about that not happening. Because I think we did learn lessons from the Great Depression. Is there some limit to the amount of money we can spend? Yes. Or print trying to solve this crisis? There is. And are we getting close to it? The limit is our ability to finance these expenditures through borrowing. And, you know, the United States is fortunate that it has the largest, most stable economic and political system around. And so the dollar is still strong because people are still buying Treasury Bills. They still think that is the safest investment out there. If we do not get a handle on this, and also start looking at our long-term deficit projections, at a certain point people will stop buying those Treasury Bills. Do you have any idea when this might end? Or when things might start getting better? Well, we are already starting to see flickers of hope out there. refinancings have significantly increased. Interest rates have never been lower. That promises the possibility at least of the housing market bottoming out and stabilizing. It is not going to happen equally in every part of the country. I just want to say that the only thing less popular than putting money into banks is putting money into the auto industry. So... 18 percent are in favor. That is ... Seventy-six percent against. It is not a high number. You are sitting here. And you are -- you are laughing. You are laughing about some of these problems. Are people going to look at this and say, I mean, he is sitting there just making jokes about money-- How do you deal with -- I mean, wh -- explain - Well... ... the mood and your laughter. Yeah, I mean, there is got to be... Are you punch drunk? No, no. There is gotta be a little gallows humor to get you through the day. You know, sometimes my team talks about the fact that if you had said to us a year ago that the least of my problems would be Iraq, which is still a pretty serious problem, I do not think anybody would have believed it. But we have got a lot on our plate. And a lot of difficult decisions that we are going to have to make. Afghanistan. Speaking of which. Yeah. What should that mission be? Making sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests and our allies. That is our number one priority. And in service of that priority there may be a whole host of things that we need to do. We may need to build up economic capacity in Afghanistan. We may need to improve our diplomatic efforts in Pakistan. We may need to bring a more regional, diplomatic approach to bear. We may need to coordinate more effectively with our allies. But we cannot lose sight of what our central mission is. The same mission that we had when we went in after 9-11. And that is these folks can project violence against the United States' citizens. And that is something that we cannot tolerate. But what we cannot do is think that just a military approach in Afghanistan is going to be able to solve our problems. So what we are looking for is a comprehensive strategy. And there is gotta be an exit strategy. There is gotta be a sense that this is not perpetual drift. Afghanistan has proven to be very hard to govern. This should not come as news to anybody given its history. Right. As the graveyards of empire. And there are people now who are concerned. We need to be careful what we are getting ourselves into in Afghanistan. Because we have come to be looked upon there by people in Afghanistan, and even people now in Pakistan. Right. As another foreign power coming in, trying to take over the region. I am very mindful of that. And so is my national security team. So's the Pentagon. Afghanistan is not going to be easy in many ways. And this is not my assessment. This is the assessment of commanders on the ground. Is Iraq was actually easier than Afghanistan. It is easier terrain. You have got a much better educated population, infrastructure to build off of. You do not have some of the same destabilizing border issues that you have between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And so this is going to be a tough nut to crack. But it is not acceptable for us to simply sit back and let safe havens of terrorists plan and plot One question about Dick Cheney and Guantanamo. I am sure you want to answer this. Oh, absolutely. A week ago Vice President Cheney-- said essentially that your willingness to shut down Guantanamo and to change the way prisoners are treated and interrogator -- interrogated -- was making America weaker and more vulnerable to another attack. And that the interrogation techniques that were used at Guantanamo were essential in preventing another attack against the United States. I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney. Not surprisingly. You know, I think that Vice President Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we cannot reconcile our core values, our Constitution, our belief that we do not torture, with our national security interests. I think he is drawing the wrong lesson from history. The facts do not bear him out. I think he is -- that attitude, that philosophy has done incredible damage to our image and position in the world. I mean, the fact of the matter is after all these years how many convictions actually came out of Guantanamo? How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney? It has not made us safer. What it has been is a great advertisement for anti-American sentiment. Which means that there is constant effective recruitment of Arab fighters and Muslim fighters against U.S. interests all around the world. Some of it being organized by a few people who were released from Guantanamo. Well there is no doubt that we have not done a particularly effective job in sorting through who are truly dangerous individuals that we have got to make sure are not a threat to us, who are folks that we just swept up. The whole premise of Guantanamo promoted by Vice President Cheney was that somehow the American system of justice was not up to the task of dealing with these terrorists. I fundamentally disagree with that. Now do these folks deserve Miranda rights? Do they deserve to be treated like a shoplifter down the block? Of course not. What do you do with those people? Well, I think we are going to have to figure out a mechanism to make sure that they not released and do us harm. But do so in a way that is consistent with both our traditions, sense of due process, international law. But this is the legacy that is been left behind. And, you know, I am surprised that the Vice President is eager to defend a legacy that was unsustainable. Let us assume that we did not change these practices. How long are we going to go? Are we going to just keep on going until -- you know, the entire Muslim world and Arab world despises us? Do we think that is really going to make us safer? I do not know a lot of thoughtful thinkers, liberal or conservative, who think that that was the right approach. So have you gotten into a routine? I have. You know, I typically work out in the morning. Michelle's often there with me. What time? After the workout, have breakfast, read the papers, read my morning security briefing. And then I come down here and talk to our National Security team. Then we talk to the economic team. After that, who knows? Anything goes. But typically between seven and 10:00 I sort of know what I am doing. And this is the living quarters. This is the living quarters, up on the second floor. We got a gym right over there up on the third floor. And the second floor is our bedroom's on this side, and we got a dining room on that side. And yeah, pretty nice digs. How are you finding the job? It is exhilarating. It is challenging you know, I find that the governance part of it, the decision making part of it actually comes -- comes pretty naturally. I think I have got a great team. I think we are making good decisions. The hardest thing about the job is staying focused. Because there is so many demands and decisions that are pressed upon you. What is the hardest decision you have had to make in the last 60 days? Well, I would say that the decision to send more troops-- into Afghanistan. You know, I think it is the right thing to do. But it is a weighty decision because we actually had to make the decision prior to the completion of strategic review that we were conducting. When I make a decision to send 17 thousand young Americans to Afghanistan, you can understand that intellectually - but understanding what that means for those families, for those young people when you end up sitting at your desk, signing a condolence letter to one of the family members of a fallen hero, you are reminded each and every day at every moment that the decisions you make count. What is the most frustrating part of the job? The fact that you are often confronted with bad choices that flow from less than optimal decisions made a year ago, two years ago, five years ago, when you were not here. A lot of times, when things land at my desk, it is a choice between bad and worse. And as somebody pointed out to me the only things that land on my desk are tough decisions. Because, if they were easy decisions, somebody down the food chain's already made them. Uh-huh. How many decisions do you have to make a day? Cannot count 'em. Lots. Yeah, lots. Every time somebody walks in your office. There is a decision. Otherwise, they do not get a meeting. And you are briefed for all that before it happens. I am. I spend a lot of time reading. People keep on asking me, Well, what are you reading these days? Well, mostly briefing books. You know, you get a little time to read history or you know, policy books that are of interest. But there is a huge amount of information that has to be digested, especially right now. Because the complexities of Afghanistan are matched, maybe even dwarfed, by the complexities of the economic situation. And there are a lot of moving parts to all of that. Do you take a day off? I do. Its never a full day, but typically Saturdays and Sundays. I will wander down to the oval office I will do some work, but I will still have time for the kids. Pretty spectacular swing set. I have to say that I was not the purchaser of this. The admiral, our chief usher, Admiral Steve Rochon, took great interest when we said that we should get a swing set, and found what I assume must be the -- Rolls Royce of swing sets. You did not have one of these when you were a kid? I sure did not. I thought we were going to get like two swings. But they went all out. Have the girls had kids over after school? They have. And they have tested this out. And it got a thumbs up. Are they liking it here? You know, they are adapting remarkably-- in ways-- that I just would not have expected. I mean... Well, this is pretty cool. Well it is cool, but what is interesting is actually how unimpressed they are with it. I mean they -- they are going to school. They are unchanged. They are the same sweet, engaging, happy unpretentious kids that they were... And they are having fun. They do seem to be having fun. And and Michelle is thriving as well. I mean she just started a vegetable garden out here. Ah, where is that? That is ... Is that nearby? Is that... No, that is pretty far down. But they just actually -- all the chefs -- from the White House staff went down there with her. And they started digging ground. And they are going to be planting stuff. And this is part of the message that she wants to send about good nutrition. Have you gotten lost in here yet? I have. Repeatedly. Harry Truman called the White House The Great White Jail. And -- and -- and Bill Clinton said he could not make up his mind whether it was the finest public housing in America or the jewel of the prison system. The bubble that the White House represents is tough. And one of the things that I am constantly struggling with is how to break out of it. And I have taken to the practice of reading ten letters selected from the 40,000 that we get every night, just to hear from voices outside of my staff. The inability to just go, and you know, sit at a corner coffee shop and have a chat with people, or just listen to what folks are saying at the next table, that I think, is something that, as ENTITY, you have gotta constantly fight against.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevekroftcbsnews60minutes", "title": "Interview with Steve Kroft on CBS News' 60 Minutes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-kroft-cbs-news-60-minutes", "publication_date": "22-03-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 100, "text": "If Bashar al-Assad yields control of his chemical weapons to international authority, are we back from the brink? Is military strike on pause? Absolutely, if, in fact, that happened. I do not think that we would have gotten to this point unless we had maintained a credible possibility of a military strike. And I do not think now's the time for us to let up on that. I want to make sure that that norm against use of chemical weapons is maintained. That is in our national security interest. If we can do that without a military strike, that is overwhelmingly my preference. And now the key is, can we see, with a sense of urgency -- Urgency meaning how long does he have to show this is real? A week? A month? This is one of those situations where the stakes are high, but they are long term. They are not immediate. They are not imminent. But they are serious. I do not anticipate that you would see a succession of votes this week or, you know, any time, you know, in the immediate future. And so I think there will be time, during the course of the debates here in the United States, for the international community, the Russians and the Syrians, to work with us to see is there a way to resolve this. But I want to make sure -- So we are talking weeks? -- that we do not take pressure off. I am not going to put a particular time frame on. I think that we know what is at stake here. We know that the international community, even Assad's allies, like Iran, agree that chemical weapons use is abhorrent. You still want Congress to vote authorization? And do you still reserve the right to strike if they say no? Strikes may be less effective if I do not have congressional support and if the American people do not recognize why we are doing this. So I have not made a final determination in terms of what next steps would be. My hope would be that I can persuade Congress that this is important. My hope is that I can persuade some of the American people that this is important. But ultimately I understand why a lot of Americans are resistant. I think the polls are clear. I read them. This is not Iraq. This is not Afghanistan. This is not Libya. The goal would be to degrade the capacity of Assad to carry out the specific chemical weapons attacks. And Bashar al-Assad has said everything is possible in terms of retaliation. Do you feel at this moment, looking at everything that is possible -- Mm-hmm. -- that the American people should brace for retaliation? No. Look, we take all precautions. But understand, Assad's capabilities are not significant compared to ours. They are significant compared to an opposition that are not professional fighters. But they have allies; Iran, Hezbollah. They are significant relative to 400 children that they gassed. They are not significant relative to us. Iran is not going to war with the United States over the use of weapons that they themselves object to. But I think it is important for us to understand that if, in fact, the choice is between a world in which dictators and other countries start believing it is acceptable to use chemical weapons on civilians and children, that will make it more dangerous for us. It means our troops, when they are in theater, all start having to wear gas masks because they do not know whether or not chemical weapons would be used. If we can resolve this without military conflict, that is my great preference, because I have to tell you that I would much rather be talking about how we can provide early childhood education to our kids and create more jobs and focus on all the things that I really think the American people care deeply about. But as -- my responsibility as commander in chief is to make sure that I think about our long-term national security interests. And the use of chemical weapons threatens that in a significant way.

{"id": 473, "text": "Hello? Yes. Good evening, ENTITY . Yes. Good evening. ENTITY 's Visit to Vietnam You must be very exhausted by now. That is why we are so grateful for you to grant RFA your very first post-Vietnam interview. My name is Nguyen Bich, or you can call me just Bich for short. And I am the director of the Vietnamese service at Radio Free Asia. And sitting by me in our studio is Dan Sutherland, who is vice president for programming. So, ENTITY , my first question to you is, how do you feel? Do you feel you have accomplished your goal by this first trip ever made by a ENTITY of the United States to a reunified Vietnam? Yes, I think it was a very successful trip; first, because we were able to see and support the attempts that are being made there to recover the missing in action from the Vietnam conflict and to continue our cooperation with the Vietnamese Government in that regard. We also gave them several hundred thousand pages of documents to help them identify the some 300,000 people still missing who are Vietnamese. Then, I think it was important because we contributed, I believe, to the continuing economic progress of the country which I think will lead to more openness. And thirdly, I think it was important because I was able to speak on television to the country about the kind of future I hope we will share with Vietnam and the fact that I hope there will be more openness and more freedom in it. And I also had, finally, some very good discussions and some constructive disagreements with the leadership of Vietnam. Your speech at Hanoi University certainly was very impressive. And so I think that made a really big impression on the country. As this was your first trip to Vietnam, could you give us a general impression of the country, at least what you saw of it, and of the people? Were they warm and welcoming? They were very warm and very welcoming and clearly interested in the trip. And the young people with whom I talked were clearly interested in having closer ties with America. So I felt very good about that. I also was interested in all the changes that are occurring in the northern part of the country. I think there is clearly a lot of new investment going on in Hanoi, a lot of new businesses coming out, a lot of changes there that I think will tend to make the south and the north perhaps less different in terms of the economic lives and maybe the political outlooks of the people at least in the cities. Now, the only village that I went to was the one where the search for the pilot was going on. People say that, in Vietnam, it is still some distance between the potential and realization. Do you get a feeling that the people are impatient for progress, especially among the young, or do you think, as the Government says, that they are pretty satisfied with the present pace of things? Well, I would say that they understand that the country is doing better, and they like that. But my impression is that they want to move forward as rapidly as they can. After all, 60 percent of the country now is under 30. And I think they have a keen awareness that they have to make a lot of changes in order to keep creating jobs. I think they need 1.4 million new jobs every year. On the morning of my last day there, I had an amazing roundtable discussion with a number of young Vietnamese men and women who ranged in age from early twenties to midthirties, and who did everything from working for Cargill, the big international grain company, to running the Vietnam office of Saachi and Saachi, which is a big London advertising agencyexcuse me. Then there was one young man who had a job in the party and others who had other jobs. But what was interesting to me is, they were all thinking about the big questions, you know, how much personal freedom is needed in life, what kinds of decisions should be made by the individual, and what kind of decisions should be made by families or villages or the nation, the Government, and how much of the economy should be private and how much should be public. The man who runs the city government in Ho Chi Minh City was quite proud of the fact that they had done a remarkable job of creating jobs in the private sector, that he had downsized the government, that poverty had been reduced by 70 percent, and homelessness was reduced by 70 percent. So I think there are a lot of people there who have this feeling that if they go more to a private economy and they have more entrepreneurial spirit, that there will also be more personal freedom associated with it. Yes. I understand that the First Lady also had some strong words to recommend human rights at her talk in the morning of Sunday. Yes. She met with a group of women there. It was something she tries to do in every country in the world she visits. She is been speaking about that, especially as human rights affect women and young girls, ever since she went to the Beijing Women's Conference several years ago. That is wonderful. Now, what is your reading of the progress so far made about the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreements? Did you get any indication while you were there as to when the Vietnamese National Assembly might get to ratify that? I think they will ratify it pretty soon. I thinkI had the feeling they want to make absolutely sure that we are going to ratify it. And they understand that the timing is not good for ratification now, but I think as soon as we ratify it, they will. And then I think that we told them that we would be spending a couple million dollars a year over the next 3 years to help ensure the rapid and thorough implementation of the agreement. And we told them that we would like to have a high-level meeting, at least annually, to plot a joint economic strategy for the future, and they agreed to that. So my instinct is that they do want to get the maximum benefits out of this trade agreement. But then, what would be your impression as to when the U.S. Congress might ratify that? I think they will do it as soon as they have a chance, probably early next year. You know, I wish I could do it now, but I just do not know if it is practical. So I think that I do not think there is any shot that it will not be approved by the Congress. There is just too much support for it. being very diplomatic in handling the question of human rights, religious, and other democratic freedoms in Vietnam. But Hanoi's sensitivity to this question is all too obvious. Did you make any headway in your talk with Secretary General Le Kha Phieu or Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on this front, or do you think the U.S. could work with Vietnam on this matter in a more open fashion? I had very open conversations with all of them, with the Prime Minister, with the Secretary General and ENTITY. And what I believe is that once they realize that we are not trying to tell Vietnam how to run every aspect of their lives and that we feel that we are going to be in a friendly relation, we have to be honest about our disagreements, and we have to say what we think human rights and religious rights and individual freedom have meant to our country. I think we will be in a dialog there, and I think that, plus the process of economic and social change which is going on in Vietnam will lead the country in a positive direction. That is what I believe. I think it will be very important for my successor to continue that dialog. I do not think we can drop human rights or religious freedom from our concerns anywhere in the world. Can we ask you just one last quick question Sure. Did you have a chance to play your saxophone while you were there? No. But I love the music. I didhowever, I heard a Vietnamese saxophone player at the entertainment after the state dinner, and he was really, really good. All the musicians were great. I was very impressed by the musical performances that were done after the state dinner. You would not allow us maybe just Press Secretary Siewert. No, I think we have to wrap up. Sorry. We are in Alaska, and we have to get back on the plane to go home. I am sorry. Thank you.

{"id": 164, "text": "My big push is making sure we are focused on opportunity, making sure that every single day, all of us in Washington are trying to think about ways that we can help folks get good jobs, make sure that they are trained for the good jobs that are out there, make sure that those jobs pay, make sure our kids are getting a great education. Those are the issues that the American people still very much are concerned about. And obviously there is going to be more that we can do if Congress is able to break through some of the gridlock. And if we are able to, for example, pass immigration reform, that is going to add growth to our economy, reduce our deficits. You do not seem confident that that is going to happen, though. No, actually, I actually think that we have a good chance of getting immigration reform Oh, I do not mean immigration reform, I mean the jobs issue, though. I think there are going to be some issues where it is going to be tough for them to move forward. And I am going to continue to reach out to them and say here are my best ideas, I want to hear yours. But as I said at the State of the Union, I cannot wait. And the American people, more importantly, cannot wait. We know that one of the biggest problems right now in the jobs market is the long-term unemployed. Yeah, they are having trouble. People will not hire them because they have been unemployed so long. Because they have been unemployed so long, folks are looking at that gap in the resume and they are weeding them out before these folks even get a chance for an interview. So what we have done is to gather together 300 companies, just to start with, including some of the top 50 companies in the country, companies like Walmart and Apple and Ford and others, to say let us establish best practices. Do not screen people out of the hiring process just because they have been out of work for a long time. We just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression. All those things cumulatively are going to have an impact. Will we be able to have more of an impact if we can get Congress, for example, to pass a minimum-wage law that applies to everybody as opposed to me just through executive order making sure that folks who are contractors to the federal government have to pay a minimum wage? Absolutely. And that is why I am going to keep on reaching out to them. But I am not going to wait for them. Your critics say this is diminished expectations. And I have been covering you for a long, long time, as you remember, 2005, 2006 in the Senate. I remember during the campaign when you talked about your presidency being a moment when the rise of the oceans would slow and the nation and the world would heal. And now you are talking about pen and phone and executive orders and executive actions. Do you think you were naive back then or have you recalibrated your expectations and your ambitions? Well, part of it is we got a lot of that stuff done. We have got in this country a health care reform that has already signed up millions of people and makes sure that everybody who is watching, anybody who already has insurance will not be dropped because of a preexisting condition. And if they do not have health insurance, they can get it on HealthCare.gov. We have made enormous strides on the education front, changing our student loan programs so that millions more young people get student loans. And so part of what is happened is that checklist that I had when I came into office, we have passed a lot of that and we are implementing a lot of it. And so in no way are my expectations diminished or my ambitions diminished, but what is obviously true is we have got divided government right now. The House Republicans in particular have had difficulty rallying around any agenda, much less mine. And in that kind of environment, what I do not want is the American people to think that the only way for us to make big change is through legislation. We have all got to work together to continue to provide opportunity for the next generation. And let us talk about House Republicans and Senate Republicans because there has been a large contingency of Republicans critical of your new approach. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who might run for president, calls this the imperial presidency. And in the House, there is this thing, as you know, called the Stop Act. They want to rein in what you are trying to do. How do you respond to that? Well, I do not think that is very serious. The truth of the matter is, is that every president engages in executive actions. In fact, we have been very disciplined and sparing in terms of the executive actions that we have taken. We make sure that we are doing it within the authority that we have under statute. But I am not going to make an apology for saying that if I can help middle-class families and folks who are working hard to try to get in the middle class do a little bit better, then I am going to do it. And you know, I think it is a tough argument for the other side to make that not only are they willing to do anything, but they also want me not to do anything, in which case I think the American people, whose right now estimation of Congress is already pretty low, might might have an even lower opinion of. The Stop Act is not something you take seriously? I am not particularly worried about it. Let us talk about areas where you might be able to make some progress. Yeah. I know that a pathway to citizenship and immigration reform is very important to you. And it is very important to Democrats and others. It is possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in this country, but not citizenship. Would you veto that? Well, you know, I am not going to prejudge what gets to my desk. Right. But how important is that principle? Well, I think the principle that we do not want two classes of people in America is a principle that a lot of people agree with, not just me and not just Democrats. But I am encouraged by, you know, what Speaker Boehner has said. Obviously, I was encouraged by the bipartisan bill that passed out of the Senate. I genuinely believe that Speaker Boehner and a number of House Republicans, folks like Paul Ryan, really do want to get a serious immigration reform bill done. If the speaker proposes something that says right away folks are not being deported, families are not being separated, we are able to attract top young students to provide the skills or start businesses here and then there is a regular process of citizenship, I am not sure how wide the divide ends up being. That is why I do not want to prejudge it. I just wonder if you see this at all in terms of especially the pathway to citizenship in the way that you seemed to when you were passing health care reform and I was covering it, the public option. In other words, it would be great, in your view, if you could do it. It is not going to happen and there might be some expectation- setting you have to do, because I, having reported on this, I do not think House Republicans can pass anything that has a pathway to citizenship. Well, here is the good news, though. Number one, there is a desire to get it done. And that, particularly in this Congress, is a huge piece of business, because they have not gotten a lot done over the last couple of years out of the House Republican Caucus. They have been willing to say what they are against, not so much what they are for. I do know that for a lot of families, the fear of deportation is one of the biggest concerns that they have got. And that is why we took executive actions, given my prosecutorial discretion, to make sure we are not deporting kids who grew up here and are Americans, for all practical purposes. But we need to get that codified. And the question is, is there more that we can do in this legislation that gets both Democratic and Republican support, but solves these broader problems, including strengthening borders and making sure that we have a legal immigration system that works better than it currently does. The fact that they are for something, I think, is progress. The second thing here, though, I want to make sure that I am not just making decisions, about what makes sense or not. We are going to be consulting with the people who stand to be affected themselves. Not just the immigration rights groups and organizations and advocates, but also ordinary folks. How do they feel? What is it that they are looking for? What do they aspire to? And, you know, this is something where you have got to have a serious conversation around the country. I do know that for a lot of families the fear of deportation is one of the biggest concerns that they have got. And that is why we took executive actions given my prosecutorial discretion, to make sure we are not deporting kids who grew up here and are Americans for all practical purposes. But we need to get that codified. And the question is, is there more that we can do in this legislation that gets both Democratic and Republican support, but solves these broader problems, including strengthening borders and making sure that we have a legal immigration system that works better than it currently does. Another big issue in this country right now has to do with the legalization of marijuana. You gave an interview to the New Yorker's David Remnick and you said that you thought smoking pot was a bad habit, but you did not think it was any worse for a person than drinking. Now, that contradicts the official Obama administration policy, both on the website of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and also the fact that marijuana is considered a Schedule One narcotic, along with heroin and Ecstasy. Now, do you think you were maybe talking just a little too casually about it with Remnick and the New Yorker? Or are you considering not making marijuana a Schedule One narcotic? Well, first of all, what is and is not a Schedule One narcotic is a job for Congress. It is not I think it is the DEA that decides that. It is not something by ourselves that we start changing. No, there are laws undergirding those determinations. Would you support that move? But the broader point, I stand by my belief based, I think, on the scientific evidence, that marijuana, for casual users, individual users, is subject to abuse, just like alcohol is and should be treated as a public health problem and challenge. But as I said in the interview, my concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individual users that have been applied unevenly and, in some cases, with a racial disparity. I think that is a problem. Over the long term, what I believe is, if we can deal with some of the criminal-penalty issues, then we can really tackle what is a problem, not just for marijuana, but also alcohol, also cigarettes, also harder drugs, and that is, try to make sure that our kids do not get do not get into these habits in the first place. And you know, the incarceration model that we have taken particularly around marijuana does not seem to have produced the kinds of results that we have set. But I do offer a cautionary note. And I said this in the interview, those who think legalization is a panacea, I think they have to ask themselves. Right. Some tough questions, too, because if we start having a situation where big corporations with a lot of resources and distribution and marketing arms are suddenly going out there peddling marijuana, then the levels of abuse that may take place are going to be higher. Are going to be higher.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjaketappercnnsstatetheunion3", "title": "Interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's State of the Union", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jake-tapper-cnns-state-the-union-3", "publication_date": "02-02-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 404, "text": "So you have set out your goals for the country, 100 million vaccine doses by next week, $100 million dollars out the door, every American eligible for the vaccine by, adult American, by May 1st, something close to normal on July 4th. But tell everyone, when is everything going to be normal for Americans? Well, first of all, I will not even be able to meet the July 4th deadline unless people listen, wear masks, wash their hands, and socially distance, because not everyone by July 4th will have been vaccinated. How do you get the politics out of this vaccine talk? I honest to God thought we had it out. I honest to God thought that once we guarantee we had enough vaccine for everybody, things would start to calm down. Well, they have calmed down a great deal, but I just do not understand this sort of macho thing about, I am not going to get the vaccine. I have a right as an American, my freedom to not do it. Well, why do not you be a patriot, protect other people? How about emphasizing the positive? How has life changed for you since you got the vaccine? I can hug my grandkids now. They come over to the house. I can see them. I am able to be with them. I have had the vaccine. Secondly, it has changed my life in the sense that I have been able to demonstrate to other people that, I doubt whether people expected me to take it if I did not think it was safe, to make the case that it is safe to take the vaccine. It is important to take the vaccine. Let us talk about the crisis at the border. Some heartbreaking scenes down there right now. A lot of the migrants coming in saying they are coming in because you promised to make things better. It seems to be getting worse by the day. Was it a mistake not to anticipate this surge? Well, first of all, there was a surge the last two years. In '19 and '20 there was a surge as well. This one might be worse. No. Well, it could be, but here is the deal. First of all, the idea that ENTITY said come because I heard the other day that they are they are coming because they know I am a nice guy and I will not do what Trump did. They are saying this. Yeah. Well, here is the deal. They are not. The adults are being sent back, number one. Number two, what do you do with an unaccompanied child that comes to the border? Do you repeat what Trump did? Take them from their mothers, move them away, hold them in cells, et cetera. We are not doing that. What we are doing is we have brought in HHS and also brought in FEMA to provide for enough safe facilities for them to get out of the control of the border patrol, which are not designed to hold people for long periods of time, particularly children, get them out of those facilities. Most of them come with a phone number. What we are doing is we are putting together an entire organizational structure so that within seven days they are able to get on the phone, contact that number, find out whether there is a mother or a father, whether it is safe, whether it is a secure circumstance to get the child to that adult. It is going to take some time though to get those policies in place again. Do you have to say quite clearly, Do not come.? Yes. I can say quite clearly, Do not come. What we are in the process of getting set up, and it is not going to take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. Do not leave your town or city or community. We are going to make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run by DHS and also access with HHS, the Health and Human Services, to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now. Make your case. We will have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That is the best way to do this. In addition to that, while we also change the circumstances on the ground in those communities, you are going to diminish the reason why people want to leave in the first place. You are out here selling your COVID relief package. You are executing the COVID relief package now as well. What is next on your legislative agenda? If you notice the criticism of the COVID relief package, my Republican friends, is they say it spends too much money and it gives too many tax breaks. All these tax breaks go to the bottom 60% of the population. Guess what? They need it, the $1,400 check, childcare tax credit. They do not like it because in fact their idea of a tax cut is to give the Trump tax cut where 83% went to the top 1% of the people in America. You are going to be raising those taxes. Yes. Anybody making more than $400,000 will see a small to a significant tax increase. If you make less than $400,000, you will not see one single penny in additional federal tax. But, let us talk raw politics here. You did not get a single Republican vote for tax cuts. How are you going to get a Republican vote for a tax increase? Oh, I may not get it, but I will get the Democratic votes for a tax increase. If we just took the tax rate back to what it was when Bush was president, the top rate paid 39.6% in federal taxes, that would raise $230 billion. Yet, they are complaining because I am providing a tax credit for childcare, for the poor, for the middle class, keeping people, and by the way, my proposal in the relief plan I put forward, it creates seven million jobs according to a whole range of people, including Moody's on Wall Street, number one. Increases the GDP by over a trillion dollars. Actually raises, raises income in America and diminishes debt in America. I mean, what are these guys talking about? By your own admission, just so you are not likely to get Republican votes for the tax increase, you are not likely to get Republican for H.R.1, expanding voting rights or the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Are not you going to have to choose? I know you have been reluctant to do away with the filibuster. Are not you going to have to choose between preserving the filibuster and advancing your agenda? Yes, but here is the choice. I do not think you have to eliminate the filibuster. You have to do it what it used to be when I first got to the Senate back in the old days when you used to be around there. That is that a filibuster, you had to stand up and command the floor. You had to keep talking alone. No one could say quorum call. Once you stopped talking, you lost that and someone could move in and say, I move the question of,. You got to work for the filibuster. You are for that reform. You are for bringing back the talking filibuster. I am. That is what it was supposed to be. Look, do not hold me to the numbers, George, but I think between 1960 and 2000, there were like, I am making this number up, I do not know. There were like 50 filibusters. Now there are like 200 since then, since that rule changed. Just put a hold on it, that is it. Yeah. I mean, the idea, it almost is getting to the point where democracy is having a hard time functioning, a hard time functioning. Look, I am not saying this is going to be easy, George, but I do believe there is enough Republicans over time who are going to have, look you are - They have not had that epiphany you said you were going to see in the campaign. No, no. Well, I have only been here six weeks, pal. Okay. Give me a break. I have been here six weeks. I think the epiphany is going to come between now and 2022. There is 78% of the people say they support this program, 52% of Republicans. Let us assume it is off by 15%. You are going to go home and campaign. Republican voters want that $1,500 because they are in trouble. Republican voters want to be able to choose between being able to go to work and send their kid to a daycare that they can afford. Republican voters want to be able to take care of a childcare tax credit. I mean, it is not like every Republican voter is a billionaire. By the way, I am not saying I will do it again, but I want those Republican voters in suburbia. Director of National Intelligence came out with a report today saying that Vladimir Putin authorized operations during the election to denigrate you, support President Trump, undermine our elections, divide our society. What price must he pay? He will pay a price. We had a long talk he and I. I know him relatively well. The conversation started off I said, I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared. You said you know he does not have a soul. I did say that to him, yes. His response was, We understand one another. I was not being a wise guy. I was alone with him in his office. That is how it came about. It was when President Bush had said, I have looked in his eyes and saw his soul. I said, I looked in your eyes and I do not think you have a soul. He looked back at me and he said, We understand each other. Look, the most important thing in dealing with foreign leaders in my experience, and I have dealt with an awful lot of them over my career, is just know the other guy. You know Vladimir Putin. Do you think he is a killer? I do. So what price must he pay? The price he is going to pay, well, you will see shortly. By the way, we ought to be able that old, that trite expression and walk and chew gum at the same time, there are places where it is in our mutual interest to work together. That is why I renewed the START agreement with him. That occurred while he is doing this, but that is overwhelmingly in the interest of humanity that we diminish the prospect of a nuclear exchange. President Trump reached a deal with the Taliban to have all American troops leave by May 1st. Are they going to leave? I am in the process of making that decision now as to when they will leave. The fact is that that was not a very solidly-negotiated deal that the former President worked out. We are in consultation with our allies, as well as the government. That decision's going to be, it is in process now. Likely to take longer? I do not think a lot longer. But May 1st is tough. It could happen, but it is tough. Because, look, one of the drawbacks, George, and this going to be like Sanskrit to people listening here, but it is the failure to have an orderly transition from the Trump presidency to my presidency, which usually takes place from election day to the time you are sworn in, has cost me time and consequences. For example, we did not realize how bad things were in terms of lack of vaccines. We were not able to get access to this information. That is one of the issues we are talking about now in terms of Afghanistan. Let me ask you about Governor Cuomo of New York. I know you have said you want the investigation to continue. If the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign? Yes. I think he will probably end up being prosecuted too. But, how about right now? You said you want the investigation to continue. You saw Chuck Schumer, Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, a majority of the congressional delegation do not think he can be an effective governor right now. Can he serve effectively? Well, that is a judgment for them to make about their state where they can be effective. Here is my position. It is been my position since I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. A woman should be presumed to telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward, number one. But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. That is what is going on now. You have been very clear. If the investigation confirms the claims, he is gone. That is what I think happens. By the way, it may very well be that there could be a criminal prosecution that is attached to it. I just do not know. I do not know what it is, but I started from the presumption it takes a lot of courage for a woman to come forward. The presumption is it should be taken seriously and it should be investigated. That is what is underway now. You probably walked into the oval office as president with about as much experience, if not more experience, than any other president who has ever served, more than three decades in the Senate, eight years as vice president. What is it about the job that surprised you that even you did not know? What has surprised me is that I am not as surprised as I thought I might be. I do not know if that makes any sense. It is like sitting when I was vice-president, the big, big difference is that famous expression of Harry Truman, The buck stops here. For eight years, I had a great relationship, and still do with Barack. I'd always be the last person in the room. I'd say, Throw the pass, or, Run the ball. I'd give my opinion. I was the last guy and I get to leave, but he is all by himself to have to make that decision. That is the big difference. Is Vice-President Harris the last person in the room? Most of the time, yes. As a practical matter, yeah, she is. One final question. Sure. Is Major out of the doghouse? Yeah, the answer is yes. Major was a rescue pup. Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin. The dog is being trained now with our trainer at home in Delaware. He was going home. I did not banish him to home. Jill was going to be away for four days. I was going to be away for two so we took him home. But, you turn a corner and there is two people I do not know at all. They move and he moves to protect. But, he is a sweet dog. 85% of the people there love him. He just, all he does is lick them and wag his tail. You will see him tonight? I am going to see him tonight, yeah. Mr. President, thanks for your time. Thank you, George. I appreciate it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenabcinterviewtranscriptmarch17", "title": "Joe Biden ABC Interview Transcript March 16", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-abc-interview-transcript-march-17", "publication_date": "16-03-2021", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Joe Biden"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 189, "text": "And now to . ENTITY, welcome. Thank you, ENTITY. I am glad to be here. Is the peace process, the withdrawal of the Serb troops and the other matters, proceeding on schedule today? So far it is proceeding in an orderly way. The Serb forces are withdrawing. They are withdrawing in a fashion that appears to our commanders to be consistent with their commitment to be gone in the 11-day time period. And General Jackson is readying our forces to deploy. When will that happen, do you think? First, NATO troops when will they go in now? I think it will be quite soon. It is his decision, and they are I think there are a number of factors that are going into his thinking, but they will have to be in there pretty soon because they are determined not to let some big vacuum develop. But they have a lot of plans to make, and they are mapping them, starting with a strategy for demining, and then dealing with the refugees that are brought back and those that want to come back on their own. And they are working that. But I would expect it would be quite soon. What is your reading of this Russian troop movement today that caused such a turmoil? The Russian troops came from Bosnia into Serbia, and there was some idea that they may go into Kosovo. What is going on? Well, the last we heard was, I think, when Mr. Ivanov told Secretary Albright that they were just pre-positioning, but that they recognized that we had to work out the arrangements for their participation. And even as we speak, there are discussions going on about that. Do you foresee a major problem developing over this? I do not really think so, but there are some factors I would imagine they will have to work through. And I have not received a detailed briefing. But, for example, we are going to have almost 30 countries this time in this operation, and I would expect that in each one of the zones of responsibility, the areas of responsibility, there will be multiple countries. The Russians, I think, would like to play a major role, but they understand we have to have unity of command under General Jackson. That is the sine qua non of the whole thing. But we also know in every zone we have to have two things: First of all, there has to be the fact and the feeling of safety and security so the Kosovars will go home; secondly, in those sectors where there are Serbs, they have to know that we are committed to protecting them, too. And a lot of thought has been given to how that might best be done and how the Russians can make the strongest contribution there. So our commanders, their people, they are talking about it. They are talking it through, and I expect they will resolve it. ENTITY, were you surprised that Milosevic hung in there as long as he did, for 78 days? Not after the beginning. When we started this, I thought there would be one of three possible scenarios. First of all, I absolutely reject the theory that some people have advanced that what he did was worse than he would have done if we had not bombed as early as we did. I just simply do not believe that. He had this plan laid out; he was going to carry it into effect last October. He did not do it because of the threat of bombing. So what I knew was that if he decided to behave as he had in Bosnia, that there would be a day or two of bombing, then we'd make this agreement that we made today, or a couple of days ago, and it would be over; but that there was a strong chance that it would not, because in the mind of Mr. Milosevic there was a big difference between Bosnia and Kosovo. Bosnia was something that he wanted badly that he did not have. Kosovo was something that he had that he wanted to take absolute control of by running people out of. So once he decided to take the bombing, I was not surprised that he took it for quite a long while, because he kept looking for ways to break the unity of NATO. He kept looking for ways to turn someone against what we were doing. Of course, the third scenario was that the bombing never worked and we had to take even more aggressive measures. But I always thought there was a much better than 50-50 chance that this bombing campaign would work. And I am gratified that it has achieved our objectives. What was it, or who was it, that convinced you that bombing alone would work? Well, you know, when I talked to the American people about this in the beginning, I made it clear that there was no way that any bombing campaign could literally physically extract every Serbian soldier and paramilitary operative and put them back out of Kosovo. But I knew that our people had made dramatic progress in the last few years, even since Desert Storm, in precision-guided weapons and in the capacity of our planes to deliver them and to avoid even fairly sophisticated antiaircraft operations. And I just felt that if we worked at it and we could hold the coalition together, that we'd be able to do enough damage that we could do it. And Secretary Cohen and General Shelton felt there was a better than 50-50 chance we could do it; Mr. Berger did. Better than 50-50 was as good Yes Secretary Albright did. And I just I have been dealing with Mr. Milosevic now a long time, you know, more than 6 years, and I think I have some understanding of the politics and the environment in Serbia. And I just felt if we kept pounding away that we could raise the price to a point where it would no longer make any sense for him to go on and where he could no longer maintain his position if he did. And I regret that he required his people to go through what they have gone through, to lower their incomes as much as they have been lowered and to erode their quality of life as much as it is been eroded and even to have the civilian casualties which have been sustained, although they are far, far less than they were in Desert Storm after the bombing, for example. Still, I hate it. But what we did miraculously resulted in no combat air losses to our people we did lose two fine Army airmen in training and minimized the losses to their people, to their civilians. But it did a terrible amount of damage. And finally, they could not go on; it did not make any sense. ENTITY, as I am sure you are aware, the fact of no casualties by NATO has been used as a criticism of the whole approach here that yes, ethnic cleansing was bad in Kosovo; yes, we needed to do something; but it was not worth risking any American lives to do so. Well, now, first of all, I never said that, that it was not worth risking any lives. We did risk lives, and I think the American people should know that. Our pilots, particularly the pilots in our A-10's, they were quite frequently fired upon by people holding these shoulder missiles, and they would deliberately position themselves in populated areas where there were civilians living. And over and over again, our pilots risked their lives by avoiding firing back, when they could easily have taken those people out who were firing at them. But to do so would have killed civilians. So there was risk to the lives. I remind you, we lost two airplanes and had to go in there and rescue two pilots. So that is not true. Secondly, if we had put a ground force in for an invasion, it still would not be done today. That is, all this bombing we did, we would have had to do anyway. Let me take you back to Operation Desert Storm, where we deployed a half-million people in the theater; took, as I remember, 4 1/2 or 5 months to do it; bombed for 44 days there, but because of the terrain and the weather, they dropped more ordnance in 44 days than we did in our 79-day campaign. So we would have had to do everything we have done to do this. I told the American people at the time that we could not have mounted and executed an invasion that would have stopped this ethnic cleansing, because at the time the Rambouillet talks broke down, when the Kosovars accepted it and the Serbs did not , keep in mind, he already had 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo, and nearly 300 tanks. So no force there was no way to mobilize and implant a force quick enough to turn it back. And somehow the suggestion that our moral position would have been improved if only a few more Americans had died, I think is wrong. Believe me, fewer Serbs died than would die if we had had to invade. We would have had to deploy a force of about 200,000. We would have put them at great risk just getting them into the country. That was actually the biggest risk. I do not think the combat, once in the country, was nearly as big a risk as the problems of deploying into Kosovo. But I just do not accept that. I do not think that we moved aggressively. We were criticized by some people in the Congress and elsewhere for starting the bombing too soon. And those who say that we should have used ground forces, even if we had announced on day one we were going to use ground forces, it would have taken as long as this bombing campaign went on to deploy them, probably longer. What about just the threat of ground forces? You were criticized you and your fellow NATO leaders were criticized for taking it off the table at the very beginning, telling Milosevic all he had to do was hunker down. I was afraid that I had done that when I said to the American people that I did not intend to use ground forces. And shortly thereafter in an interview, I made it clear that I did not do that. And then repeatedly I said that, and I said I thought we ought to be planning for ground forces. So I think the differences, for example, between the British position and ours and others were somewhat overstated, because we had done quite a lot of planning for a ground force, and we had made it explicit that we were not taking the option off the table. And Chancellor Schroeder from Germany was reported as having done so. When I talked to him and examined the German text of what he'd said, it was obvious that there had been a little bit of overstatement there. So I do not think I think that the NATO my own view is if this had not worked, NATO would have put ground forces in there and that we were determined not to lose this thing, that we were determined to reverse the ethnic cleansing. I think the Europeans were especially sensitive, as I was, to the fact that it took 4 years to mobilize an action against Bosnia and that there were all kinds of arguments used about it, including the fact that U.N. peacekeepers were there, diplomacy was going on, any action would have upset all that, and they did not want that to happen this time. So the truth is that this action against ethnic cleansing was hugely more rapid and more responsive than what was done in Bosnia. And that is why there will not be nearly as many lost lives. On a more personal basis, ENTITY, some suggest when this operation began that the Lewinsky impeachment matter had weakened your moral authority to lead the country in a difficult situation like this. Were they wrong? Oh, I think so. I think the American people have been very good to me, and my family's been very good to me. And we went through a process which resulted in a decision by the public and by the Congress that I should serve. No one no thinking American wants to have a President of either party and any philosophy who cannot fully serve and does not fully do his job or her job. And so I did what I was hired to do by the American people. And I believe, as strongly as I can say, it was the right thing to do. It was the moral thing to do. And our children will have a better world because we have now stood against ethnic cleansing, and not only that, in this case, we are going to be able to reverse it and let those people go home. What is your analysis of why, for instance, the overwhelming majority of the Republicans in the House of Representatives did not vote to support this air war in the beginning? Oh, I do not know. I prefer to be grateful for those who did support it. And quite a number did. And we had very good support, a minority of Republicans in the Senate, but a substantial number supported us in a very vocal and effective way and were prepared to go even further to ground forces, as you know. So I am grateful for the support that we did have. A lot of very serious, thoughtful Republicans said they thought we were doing the right thing. Speaker Hastert voted with us, and I would remind you that we got a very good vote early on, with the help of the Speaker, for the deployment of American forces in a peacekeeping operation. And then they voted to support the troops and to fund the air war. So I am grateful for that, and I leave it to others to interpret why they did what they did. Senator Hagel, Republican from Nebraska, who voted for He did. when it was in the Senate, was asked why there were so many Republicans who were not supporting this, and he said it had to do with trust. And he said, quote, This President has debased the one currency we each have in this business, and that is trust, and he will never get it back, end quote. That is what his explanation as to why Congress did not support you any more than they did. I think that is pretty self-serving: I am not going to do what is right for my country because I do not like Bill Clinton. You know, that is I think that is pretty self-serving. You know, I was gratified when, a few years ago, a historian of the Presidency said that I had kept a higher percentage of my commitments to the American people than any of the last five Presidents who preceded me an academic man at the time I'd never even met. And so I think that that element of the party devoted the better part of 7, 8 years almost now 7 years, more than 7 years to attacking me personally because they knew the American people agree with my ideas and the direction in which I was taking the country. And on one occasion, much to my eternal regret, I gave them a little ammunition. But I have been trustworthy in my public obligations to the American people, and I have been trustworthy in my dealings with them. I have I do not agree with them, and when I do not , I tell them. But you know, we have gotten quite a lot done when they have put aside their personal frustration in not owning the White House. The truth is, those folks ought to lighten up. They believe they had they say a lot of my Republican friends, you know, they rail against the entitlement programs. They do not like the entitlement programs. But the truth is, for a long time they thought the White House was an entitlement program. They never thought there would be another Democratic President in their lifetime. And they are all gearing up again because they think they are entitled to the parking spaces outside here and to the office space and all. And this job here and this house, it does not belong to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party. The American people own this place. And we are all just here for a little while. And they ought to just relax and realize I am a temporary tenant and that we are all hired hands. And we ought to work for the American people, do our best, have the elections, and then let the people make their decision and go on again. I think that is what a lot of this is. They were they have just been mad ever since I won because a lot of them really never believed there would be another Democrat in their lifetime. And attacking if you cannot beat somebody on the ideas and the issues and the philosophy and the direction of the country and if the country is doing very well, so you just get madder and madder when the country does well, then all you have left is a personal attack and say, Oh, I just do not trust the guy. But that is not good for America. And you know, I do not attack them personally. I am not going to get into it. My door is always open; my phone is always open; and I am going to keep working with them in every way I can. Since, just in the last 24 hours, since this thing has come to this critical concluding point, people who were criticizing this action, not just Republicans but pundits and people in the foreign policy establishment, they are still criticizing you. They does that surprise you? Gosh, no. I find that in Washington, in this sort of, what Professor Deborah Tannen has called this culture of critique, if I make a mistake, people want me to admit that I made a mistake. And I have tried to do that. I think it is quite therapeutic. It is hard to do, and I had to get hit upside the head to do it. But I did it, and it was good for me. But if they turn out to be wrong, they just change the subject or just keep insisting that it was, you know, just a fluke. I think the most important thing is, were we right to take a stand in Kosovo against ethnic cleansing? Were we right to do it more quickly that we did in Bosnia? Should we set up have a principle that guides us which says: Okay, in a world where people are fighting all the time over racial or ethnic or religious problems, we cannot tell everybody they have got to get along; we cannot stop every fight, like the fight between Eritrea and Ethiopia, or the struggles in Chechnya; but where we can, at an acceptable cost that is, without risking nuclear war or some other terrible thing we ought to prevent the slaughter of innocent civilians and the wholesale uprooting of them because of their race, their ethnic background, or the way they worship God? I think that is an important principle, myself. I think it is a noble thing. I think the United States did a good thing. Now, they may argue that I did it went about it in the wrong way. They may I have answered that, I hope. At least I am confident that I did the right thing in the right way. And that is what historians can judge that based on the long-term consequences of this. But I believe what we did was a good and decent thing. And I believe that it will give courage to people throughout the world, and I think it will give pause to people who might do what Mr. Milosevic has done throughout the world. I feel awful that we were not equipped and able and on the job to stop what happened in Rwanda. And since then, I have done everything I could to train this Africa Crisis Response team, military from different countries in Africa, so that if that starts again God forbid somewhere, they can move in and stop it. I think the world the freedom-loving nations of the world need to be organized to try to stop this sort of thing. I mean, do not you think it is interesting that we are on the verge of a new century, and you are going to have all these millennial celebrations, and we are all going to talk about how 100,000 websites get added to the Internet every day, and we are going to unlock the mysteries of the human gene, and what a modern, rapid world we are going to be living in, and here we are bogged down everywhere in the world by the oldest problems of human society: We fear people who are different from us; pretty soon we hate them; once we start hating them, we dehumanize them; then it is easy to kill them. Now, it seems to me if we are going to reap the promise of the 21st century, if we do not want to go to Europe or some other place and have a bunch of Americans die in a bloody war, where we can nip this stuff in the bud we ought to do it. And that is what I have tried to do. And I think it was the right thing to do. As we sit here right now, ENTITY, is this the best moment of your Presidency? Oh, no, I would not say that. I do not know you know, there is so many things that have happened here at home that have been important to me, passing the economic plan, passing the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. So many things have happened internationally, the role that I was fortunate to be able to play in the peace process in the Middle East and in Ireland. But this could have the biggest long-term positive consequences if we do it right. But frankly, I have not sometimes people say, Well, do you feel vindicated? The answer is no. I think America has been vindicated. I think what we stand for has been vindicated. But keep in mind, there have been lots of times in the past where people win a conflict and then squander the peace. So a lot of our work is still ahead of us. We have got to get those folks home. We have got to get those landmines up. We have got to work out these details on who is going to be involved in this peacekeeping mission. We then have to get this we have got to organize police forces and a civil government for the Kosovars. And then the really big thing over the long run our European friends want to take the lead in this, but we ought to help them we have got to get the World Bank and all these other people involved in a development plan for the Balkans that involves not just Kosovo but Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and, I hope some day, Serbia, if they have a government that respects freedom and democracy and human rights, so that these people have something pulling them together instead of these ancient ethnic troubles pulling them apart. Now, if we get all that done, it might be perhaps the most satisfying thing because it might prove that people can lay down their hatreds of people who are different. I basically think free people will figure out a way to make the most of their lives and work out their problems if they can get the rules of engagement right. That is why I gave somewhat of an extended answer to what you said about the Republicans, because I think you know, differences are good. Nobody's got the whole truth. But you have got to get the rules of engagement right. And I think what we did in Kosovo was profoundly important. ENTITY, thank you very much.

And when he is looking down, I want to make sure tonight he sees his bridge lit up blue. And I think it'll put a smile on his face. Questions, comments? In terms of having concerns about people coming here from other states, are there anything, sort of protocols, you can put in place? Temperature checks at the airport, et cetera. I know it is much harder to do by people traveling by car, but is there anything the state can do to really make sure there is not- Yeah, we are not there yet, ENTITY. What other states did, if you remember in the beginning, when they were afraid of New Yorkers going there, they did a mandatory quarantine. That if New Yorkers traveled to their state, they had to quarantine for two weeks. We are not there yet, but it is just a great point of irony that when we start this situation, the other states said, No, we do not want New Yorkers coming here. Federal government was talking about blockading New York and not allowing New Yorkers to leave. Right? That is what they were talking about. Now, it would have been illegal, unconstitutional, and it would have started a civil war, but I do not know that any of those things is ever stopped the federal government before. But that is where we were. They wanted to blockade New York. The other states wanted to make sure no New Yorkers went to their state. Fast forward 106 days. We have the lowest infection rate. And my health officials are saying, We hope people from Florida do not come here. ENTITY? ENTITY. Business owners. How many businesses did you call and what kind of reception did you get? I am sorry, a little louder, ENTITY, please. What kind of reception did you get from business owners that you called about shutting down and staying shut down? Oh. People send me texts and videos and pictures. And they were sending me texts and videos of particular restaurants and bars at particular times. We got over 25,000 complaints from people, which is a very interesting phenomenon, by the way. We have never gotten 25,000 complaints. Sometimes when I say something really absurd, but not even 25,000. People are concerned, people are scared. So now they see a business doing the wrong thing, they snap a picture, right? Everybody has a phone and a camera. They snap a picture. They are doing complaints, 25,000 complaints. Some of them actually text them to me. So I made a few phone calls and said to restaurant owners, bar owners, What are you doing? We have the guidelines. I am looking at a picture of your establishment taken 25 minutes ago. I am looking at a picture of your establishment, taken 25 minutes ago, and people are violating everything. Everything. No masks, no social distancing. You are violating the rules. What are you doing? And look, the state is going to enforce the rules, the state licenses bars and restaurants for a liquor license, state liquor authority. You can lose your liquor license. You lose your liquor license, that is serious. So I just wanted to make sure they knew the laws and the rules. I wanted to make sure they knew that the state was going to be sending out inspectors. And this was a very serious sanction. And even their patrons do not respect it. That is what is interesting here. The people of the state know what they did. They know the sacrifice they made over 106 days to get that virus down. And they do not want anyone's irresponsibility to jeopardize that. The reciprocity is real. I have been with people, somebody walks by does not have a mask, they are outraged. I think that is why there were so many complaints. There are a lot of conscientious people who paid a very high price, did the right thing and they do not want other people ruining it for them. What kind of response did you get from business owners? Little disbelief, little shock that this would have communicated that quickly. And frankly, that I would have called, but no denial. They would say, We told people. Was their best response, but what does that mean? We told people? They are your patrons, in your establishment, you are responsible. ENTITY, how would social distancing be enforced on the bike path? Like any other path, like any other park, stay six feet apart when you cannot wear a mask. ENTITY, any barricades separating direction from Westchester and Rockland or with bikers and pedestrians? Do you want to answer, ENTITY? Yeah, no, there are not. As an example today, when we opened the path, we are going to have staff all across the shared use path to make sure reinforcing that people need to stay socially distancing. We also have signage out there as well. I am sorry. That is the way that is already staffed, that is monitoring? Yeah. Okay, thank you. ENTITY, Kiryas Joel confirmed to us that several private schools have reopened under the phase two religious gathering allowance. We have also have videos of dozens of kids going in, buses with backpacks and masks. There is also another video we got a huge wedding at KJ last weekend with hundreds in attendance. Orange County says Kiryas Joel is in state's police's jurisdiction, why is not state police enforcing your executive order? Well, first, local governments have the primary responsibility for enforcement. That is the law. And I have said a number of times, local governments have to do their job. My father's advice to me, Take responsibility, own it. I have taken responsibility for every bad decision and every unpopular decision, right? I am the one who closed down. I am the one who sets all these rules. Everybody's angry at me. Fine. The one thing I need the local government to do is actually enforce them. Now, they do not want to enforce them because they are not popular. Nobody wants to go to the bar and say, you guys have to wear a mask. You guys, guys being gender neutral, are violating the social distancing. I get it. But they have to do their job. Any religious group, any community, they have to do their job. If they need backup help by the state police because they cannot handle it, then we will provide state police backup help, but they have to do their job. I cannot use the state police everywhere in this state. We do not have enough state police. I need the local governments to do their job. One more then we are going to cut a ribbon. Hey, ENTITY, in chatting with any of the restaurant owners or bar owners about lack of social distancing and not wearing masks, did any of them counter to you by saying, Well, where is your call on your request to the protestors who had been gathering and not really social distancing and in some cases wearing masks? Should not the rules be the same for the protestors as they are for the bar owners and restaurant owners? They did not say that because they listened to my briefings. And because I have said to the protestors on a number of occasions, you should be wearing masks. And by the way, I said to the police, you should be wearing masks, even on a symbolic level. You want other people to comply with the law, you are going to enforce the law, adhere to the law. Wear a mask police officer and protester. Just kidding you. ENTITY, can you give us your impression of the bridge path. And do you think it will have an impact on the black Rockland economy? I think, and I will ask ENTITY to chime in because he sees it more closely. I think the bridge has had a tremendous positive impact on the entire regional economy. People, the commute is shorter. It is better for the environment. It is saving money. The bridge is beautiful. People are coming to restaurants, et cetera, just to see the bridge, especially before this COVID situation. And I think that pedestrian path is going to be a home run. There are other pedestrian passes on the Hudson that attract people just to walk over the Hudson. They are just a pedestrian path and people, by the thousands, go just to walk over the Hudson. Here, you can walk over the Hudson on a beautiful bridge, you can see New York City to the South, the Hudson Valley to the North. Yeah, I think you are going to get thousands of people who come and they will stop and local shops and they will stop in restaurants and they will stop in bars. ENTITY. Yeah, I think the ENTITY nailed it. There is been a tremendous amount of interest in the opening of this path, from beyond the people that live in this region. So in addition to what the ENTITY pointed out, one of the things that we have in our kiosks that are at each of the Belvederes, information related to local shopping dining, et cetera, because we want to help support the local tourism industry as well. But there is no question that this will have a positive impact on the economy here in this region. Thank you guys. Thank you. We are going to cut a ribbon. Can you respond to Mayor de Blasio's assertion that you need to calm down regarding the past weekend's violations of social distancing? That I Sorry who said that? Mayor de Blasio asserted that you should calm down regarding this past weekend violations of social distancing. What you were just referring to. I do not know what he said. I know Look at the facts. Look at our viral infection rate. Look at the other 22 states and you do not want to be one of those 22 states. Do your job local governments. Masks up. Okay. On three. One, two, three. Good job.

{"id": 0, "text": "I would like to take this opportunity to underscore our great pleasure at receiving ENTITY and express once again our friendship and admiration and support for the Government and the people of Spain. and I had an exceptionally productive and cordial meeting today. We reviewed international and bilateral matters in an open, understanding, and democratic spirit that one would expect between friends and allies. We affirmed the need for strong leadership to deal with the political and economic and social problems which underlie so much of the unrest in the world today. We agreed on the importance of maintaining Western strength and solidarity in these critical times and expressed our desire to work closely together as we face the challenges ahead. We agreed on the desirability of early, positive, and balanced conclusion to the CSCE Review Conference presently underway in Madrid. I expressed our appreciation for ENTITY,recent initiative in this regard, which we will be discussing with our friends and allies. There are numerous areas of closer cooperation, including the pursuit of our common energy security interests. We value Spain as an important partner. We welcome the ENTITY's high sense of responsibility in guiding his country at this critical moment in its history. We applaud Spain's aspirations to join Europe fully and to make its voice heard in Europe's leading institutions. We believe the West's most fundamental resource is the strength of democratic institutions. The consolidation of democracy in Spain is a ringing affirmation of the vitality of Western institutions and the appeal of Western values. Good afternoon. First of all I want to thank ENTITY for this occasion to hold an open conversation with the U.S.A., which we consider a friendly country, a good friend of Spain. As you know, Spain is a very old European country who, among other things, discovered this land that nowadays occupies this great country of yours. But it is also a young country, not only because the country people are young but because we just recovered the dignity of being a democratic country. A simple definition of Spain would characterize what her foreign policy should be. Spain is a European and a Western country-the most Western of the European countries-nothing then more logical than its wish to, and its desire, to participate and integrate in the European and the Western world and cooperate with the Western world in a common destiny. But we are also a southern country in Europe. We are very close to Africa, and our coast is in the Mediterranean Basin. This defines another important aspect of our foreign policy: the north of Africa and the important waters of the Mediterranean Basin. The fact that I cannot communicate with you in English means that there is another dimension in our policy and identity: the fact that we can communicate in our language, in Spanish, with practically 300 million people in the American Continent. This gives a third dimension in the foreign policy of Spain, without meaning that any one of them means a priority against the others. Let me tell you that I am 41 years old, and during 33 of these years, I was dreaming of a free and democratic Spain. This is, of course, what we want and we hope for our people. But this is also what we want and we hope for other peoples wherever we can project this foreign policy. We, therefore, wish and want for other countries who can communicate with us in cultural level: peace, freedom, pluralism, and progress. Because it is America and because it is such an important country in the world, you will understand perfectly well that we want also to make our links with the United States even closer, which explains two things: first of all, my presence here accepting a gracious and very kind invitation of ENTITY , and my satisfaction because of the course of these conversations we have just had.

{"id": 67, "text": "The main thing that keeps me up at night right now is we lost 8 million jobs. The month I was sworn in, we lost 750,000 jobs. We have regained about 600,000 this year so far. And if we stay on pace, hopefully we will gain several hundred thousand more. But making up for that 8 million is still going to be a challenge. Look, nobody in the White House is satisfied with where we are right now. What we absolutely are convinced of, though, is that we are on the right track. And I think that the statistics bear that out. What do you tell the person who may have voted for you, cannot find a job or got laid off since you took office, why they should still keep the Democrats in charge? If somebody's out of work right now, the only answer that I am going to have for them is when they get a job. Up until that point, from their perspective, the economic policies are not working. That is my job as ENTITY is to take responsibility for moving us in the right direction. You talk about a choice election this fall. Are you prepared for the fact that now that means your policies -- it is a referendum on you and your policies and that the voters may say, You know what, we are putting the Republicans in charge ? This is going to be a choice between the policies that got us into this mess and my policies that are getting us out of this mess. And I think if you look at the vast majority of Americans, even those who are dissatisfied with the pace of progress, they will say that the policies that got us into this mess we cannot go back to. Do you think Washington is broken? And the reason I ask you this, because when you appointed -- you did the recess appointment of Donald Berwick, you seemed to send the message of one of two things: Either you did not want a debate about health care again on Capitol Hill, which got a little raucous a year ago, or, You know what, the Senate process is broken and we have got to go around it ? You know, the fact of the matter is that I cannot play political games with the Senate on these issues. I have got a government to run. And at a certain point, we have to go ahead and just make sure that people are in place to deal with the enormous challenges that are ahead. So you are not ready to say Washington's broken. Well, here is what I am ready to say, that Washington has spent an inordinate amount of time on politics -- who is up, who is down -- and not enough on how are we delivering for the American people. The good news is that despite no cooperation from the other side, we have, over the last two years, stopped an economic free fall, stabilized the financial sector. When people are determined and are willing to take tough votes even when it is politically inconvenient, we can still get things done. I have got to leave it there. Vacation in the Gulf? I know the first lady was down there touting it in Panama City, Florida. Are we going to see you guys down there? You know, we are going to be trying to figure out where we are going to be able to take some time over the course of the summer.

{"id": 317, "text": "Thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, Secretary Shalala, Secretary Glickman, thank you for your work. Thank you, Bruce Reed. I'd like to say a special word of thanks to David Kessler for the work he did historic work he did at the FDA when he was here. Thank you, Dr. Koop, and members of the public community who are here. To Members of Congress, the attorneys general, the representatives of plaintiffs in the private litigation and we have one of the injured parties here representing all of them we thank all of them for coming today. This is a time of prosperity and hope and optimism for America, with our economy improving, making progress on our social problems, our efforts to lead the world to a more prosperous and peaceful future making headway. But I think we all know that this country still has some significant challenges, especially in the health field. And if we think about what we want America to be like in the 21st century, the health of our people and especially the health of our children must be paramount in our thinking, in our vision, and in our efforts. That is why a year ago I worked with the FDA and we launched this nationwide effort to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco by reducing youth access to tobacco products, by preventing companies from advertising to our children. The purpose of the FDA rule was to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent within 7 years. Earlier this year, a Federal judge in North Carolina said that the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect the health of our children. There have also been other examples of litigation progress, as you know, brought by private plaintiffs and by the attorneys general. Now, these victories for public health drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table. They extracted concessions that would have been literally unthinkable just a short time ago. I want to say a special word of thanks to the attorneys general and the other parties who worked hard to negotiate this settlement. Everyone knows we would not be here had it not been for their foresight, their determination, and their relentless efforts. Now we have this unprecedented opportunity to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation, working with all the parties involved, the Members of Congress, the attorneys general, the representatives of injured parties, the public health community, the tobacco farmers, and others. We have moved from confrontation and denial and inertia to the brink of action on behalf of our children, and that is all to the good. Today I want to challenge Congress to build on this historic opportunity by passing sweeping tobacco legislation that has one goal in mind: the dramatic reduction of teen smoking. In the coming weeks I will invite congressional leaders from both parties to the White House to launch a bipartisan effort to enact such legislation. There are five key elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. Reducing teen smoking has always been America's bottom line. It must be the industry's bottom line. That is why I believe the first thing any tobacco legislation must include is a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. These penalties should be non-tax-deductible, uncapped, and escalating to give the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting children as new customers. One of the surest ways of reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Today I call for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next decade, as needed, to meet our youth reduction targets. And I call upon the House to follow the lead of the United States Senate and repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a $50 billion tax credit. Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. I believe the FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as strong and effective as its authority over drugs and devices. In particular, legislation cannot impose any special procedural hurdles on the FDA's regulation of tobacco products. Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable, especially in any efforts to market products to children, while insisting on changes in the way it does business. I ask the industry again to make a voluntary commitment to stop advertising to children. And I call upon Congress to pass legislation providing for broad document disclosure so that the public can learn everything the tobacco companies know about the health effects of their products and their attempts to market to our children. Fourth, Federal tobacco legislation must aim not only to reduce youth smoking but to meet other health goals as well. These include the reduction of secondhand smoke, the expansion of smoking prevention and cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other important health objectives. We must build on the bipartisan agreement to fund children's health care in the recent balanced budget. And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities. We know that tobacco farmers are honest, hardworking people, most of whom live and work on small, family owned farms. In some States, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must protect these farmers, their families, and their communities from loss of income. Let me say in closing, I want to thank the Vice President especially, who cares so passionately about this issue. He is played a key role in our efforts to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco. I have asked him to take the lead in building broad bipartisan support around the country for our plan. I also want to thank Secretary Shalala, Secretary Glickman, and Bruce Reed, and all those who worked so hard on our administration's analysis of the proposed settlement and where we are. And finally, let me say again, we would not be here if it were not for all the people in this room and the countless others they represent around the country. To me, this is not about money. It is not about how much money we can extract from the tobacco industry. It is about fulfilling our duties as parents and responsible adults to protect our children and to build the future of this country. We are doing everything we can in this administration to give parents the tools they need to raise their children, but parents have to be our partners as well. If this is not just about money, we have to recognize that even beyond the tobacco companies and all of us in this room, every parent in America has a responsibility to talk to their children about the dangers of tobacco, illegal drugs, and other things that can hurt them. We know if we have strong parental responsibility here, they can make a great deal of difference in protecting our children as well. If we take responsibility, if we pass this legislation, if we do what we should here, if the tobacco industry will work with us, if other Members of Congress in both parties will work with us, we will have gone a very long way toward creating the state of health for our children that will make America an even greater nation in the new century. Thank you. ENTITY, what are the chances of the Congress adopting your policy? And why is the industry so conspicuously absent? Well, first of all, I was encouraged by some of the comments that were made by some industry representatives. I think that they know that they have to have Federal legislation. They have an interest in that as well. And I would hope that they would be willing to work with us. But we cannot have the FDA crippled here, and we have to have real and meaningful penalties if the targets for youth smoking are not met. And so I feel very good about that. I think the Congress I think it is highly likely that they will take action. When they take action depends, I think, upon when they can work through the issues for themselves and how they decide how to divide up the work among the committees. But it is not too soon to start. We could have hearings on this fairly soon, and I would hope to work with the Congress to develop a bill that would embody these principles. ENTITY, you have not said what you are willing to agree to for the tobacco industry. Are you willing to agree to immunity from future liability? Well, I do not think they have asked for future liability, I think they have asked for immunity from liability for past suits. And the question there would be, what are they willing to agree to? They need to come and meet with us. We need to discuss it, and we need to see whether we can embody these five principles. These are the things I am interested in. To me, I will say again, this is not primarily about money. This is about changing the behavior of the United States, both the behavior of the tobacco companies, the behavior of the American people, the future behavior of our children. I am trying to create an environment here with these five principles that I believe would achieve that. And if they want to be our partners in it, I think we can get there. And I hope they will be. Are you willing to put your prestige on the line to ensure that this becomes law? Well, I think my personal prestige on this has been on the line for more than a year now. There for a while, I thought more than my prestige was on the line. You know, for a person involved in public life in Washington today, personal prestige may be an oxymoron. But at least you still have your neck most days. What do you say to the people ENTITY, how do you protect the well-being of tobacco farmers sounds like you are going to take away their livelihood. Well, there are a number of things which can be done, and I do not want to get into the details. Secretary Glickman can talk about it. But we have had farmers in various sectors in our agriculture society facing constricted incomes before, and we have done things which helped them. There was a for example, I remember a few years ago something that affected dairy farmers in my State. There was a massive buyout program for dairy farmers, and in a lot of States like Arkansas, there were any number of small farmers that were having a very difficult time who had a chance to start their life on a different basis. I do not want to minimize this. Tobacco has a very high return per acre. So it is not a simple thing. You cannot just say to a tobacco farmer to go plant soybeans, even if the soil will hold them. This is, from an agricultural point of view, economically complex. But nonetheless, we have a responsibility to these people. They have not done anything wrong. They have not done anything illegal. They are good, hard-working, taxpaying citizens, and they have not caused this problem. And we cannot let them, their families, or their communities just be crippled and broken by this. And I do not think any member of the public health community wants to do that. And the Agriculture Department and I am personally very committed to this part; to me, this is one of the five things we have to do. We are trying to change America and make everybody whole. And they deserve a chance to have their lives and be made whole and go on with the future as well, and I am determined to see that they are a part of this. What do you say to the attorneys who thought this was a good deal and very proudly proclaimed it? Well, first of all, they were a part of all these ongoing reviews. Everybody was heard in this review process. And secondly, they all recognize, too, that this agreement has to be ratified by Congress. The tobacco companies recognize that. That means that all of us who are part of that process are, in effect, parties to this case, too. And that is the way you need to look at this. We are building on their deal. We are not rejecting their agreement. We are building on it. We are not rejecting what the attorneys general did. We are building on it. Look, if it had not been for what they did, we would not be here. I realize that there were two great things that started this. One is what Dr. Kessler and what we did at the FDA, and the fact that our administration was the first one ever willing to take this on. The other was the actions by the attorneys general and the private lawsuits that got the disclosure of the documents that created a total change in the public attitude and the public efforts here. And then long before that, there were the efforts of all of these people here from the public health community who have been telling us all this for years. And they had the public primed for it. Then the lawsuits brought about the disclosures, and then the FDA was moving. Those three things together, I think and of course, now there have been a lot of congressional hearings. Representative Waxman had a full head of hair when he came to Congress before he started on tobacco. And so I think you have got to give to me, we are building on this progress, and that is the way you have to look at this. We are trying to do the best thing for the country in a way that is consistent with the agreement they made. We are building on the agreement. We are not tearing it down. We are building on it. And I think we can get legislation that will reflect it. Thank you. What do you think about the string of air crashes, ENTITY, that have happened Bosnia, the German representative that was killed? It is a terrible thing. We do not have all the facts yet. I was briefed early this morning on it, and obviously I am profoundly concerned for the diplomat and the people that were on the aircraft and their families. But I cannot comment on the facts of it until we absolutely know what the facts are. What about the other crashes? I must say, we are making on balance, we are making some progress in Bosnia again. The events of the last several weeks are hopeful for the peace process and the Dayton accord. What about the other air crashes here in this country, this string of air accidents? What do you have to say about the air safety, and what are you going to be doing about that? I had a talk with the Secretary of Defense about them the day before yesterday, and I think we have to, first of all, analyze each and every one to see whether there is some pattern that would require some kind of review by the Air Force or whether it is just an unfortunate stream of coincidences that they all happened at the same time. I noted one that I learned about this morning involved Air National Guard planes, for example. That may or may not have anything to do with any problem with planes or anything like that. I would not over jump to conclusions about this. Remember, every year I try to say this once a year, so I want to say it now it is easy for the American people to forget the risks that our men and women in uniform undertake. Every year we lose a couple hundred people serving the United States in the military in peacetime. It is dangerous work. They have to be well-trained. They have to be skilled. They have to be brave. It is a difficult thing. I am heartsick about the plane we are missing off the coast of Africa that took a demining team in there to continue our work against landmines. But I do not want you to jump to a conclusion that there is something wrong because all these things occurred within a short space of time because, if you look over the course of a year, we may go months and months and months and nothing happens, but over the course of a year, we lose a significant number of people every year who serve our country in uniform because of the inherent risks involved in what they do. We will do everything we can to make sure that they are as safe as possible, and if there is a pattern here that has to be looked into on air safety, you can be sure that the Air Force will do that. Thank you. Are you dreading Chelsea leaving home tomorrow? Yes. This morning the first thing I did this morning was go look through the boxes and make sure we had all the right things in the right boxes. But there is nothing I can do about it now. That is what you raise them for. I am happy and sad at the same time.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedtobaccolegislationandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Tobacco Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-tobacco-legislation-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "17-09-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 328, "text": "ENTITY, I assume that your trip to Europe, after your reelection, was very well tailored, and we can imagine why you go to Brussels and to Germany. But there are lots of-lots of speculation about why you decided to go to Bratislava. So what was behind this decision? And what will be your message for Slovaks and people in our region? Thanks. I have been trying to think about when this thought got in my mind. I think-I have to credit your Prime Minister, who, in the Oval Office, said, You need to come to our country. And I thought about it, and I think I told Condi Rice then, when she was my National Security Adviser, before I named her Secretary of State, that would be a great idea. I'd like to come, and I am thankful for the invitation, because I want to say to the world, Freedom is a beautiful thing, and here is a country that is working hard to promote democracy. The spirit of your Prime Minister, talking about overcoming the difficulties to become a free society, is-was just wonderful. I have always felt like countries like the Slovak Republic are very important for the world to know more about, and-because, as you know, I am a big believer in liberty, and this is a country which is succeeding. And it is not-there is bumps in the road. It is difficult, but it is successful. So I am looking forward to coming. It is going to be one of the highlights of the trip; it really is. You have, obviously, a very good relationship with Slovak Government and the other governments of so-called new Europe. But the public does not always necessarily agree with our Government and with American policy. And you, many time, stress that you want to have a very good relationship with the whole Europe. So what is your strategy to improve the relationship with the nations, with the citizens? That is a good point. Well, first of all, nobody likes war. And basically what you are referring to is my decision to go into Iraq. And I can understand why citizens, particularly if they did not feel threatened by Saddam Hussein, would say, We do not like war, and we do not agree with what ENTITY decided. And I know that. But now they have got to see what is happening in Iraq. Eight million people voted in the face of terror. I mean, there is a free country. And so what is going to be very important for me is to connect that free country emerging with peace for their children and grandchildren. In other words, there has to be a connection in order for people to say, Well, now I understand what, you know, what the policy means. It is a-and so one of the reasons-that is what I will speak about not only-I mean, in Europe, it is very important to make that connection. It is -ours is a-mine is a mission and a trip that says, We share values, human rights and human dignity and rule of law and minority rights and respect for women. And therefore, it is those values that should unite our voices when it comes to spreading those values in parts of the world that are troubled parts of the world, Iran or Syria or, as you saw recently, in Lebanon. I am convinced that as democracy-and particularly, Israel and the Palestinian Territories-as democracy takes hold there, the people of the Slovak Republic will see, Gosh, I am beginning to understand what ENTITY was trying to do. United States and you, personally, helped to fulfill the vision of free, democratic, and united Europe. But there is something missing from this picture, and people feel that they are treated like second-class Europeans because of visa. Oh. : And I am sure you will hear about the visa very often, not only in Slovakia but also in European Union. Sure. I know your Government has many other priorities, maybe much, much bigger priorities. But can I count on your leadership, ENTITY, on this issue? No, I have heard about the visa issue. No? No, I have-yes. I mean, yes, I have heard about the visa issue. In other words, what I was saying, No, this is not a minor issue. This is an issue that our friends have brought up quite frequently. And we are trying to work it through. There is an old policy in place that needs to be renewed and reviewed, given the new realities of the Slovak Republic or Poland or the Czech Republic or wherever. And so I have told Condi Rice, Let us just make sure our visa policy is fair and balanced. So we can count on your help? I am not sure you can count on the results, but you can count on my interest. ENTITY, you are going to meet President Putin in Bratislava. Yes. And in Washington, many people are concerned about corrosion of democracy in Russia. And you, in a summit in Chile, you also raised the issue of Russia's curb on democracy. So how much you are concerned about this issue of Russia? Well, I have a good relationship with President Putin. And the reason-and that is important, because that then will give me a chance to say in private-ask him why he is been making some of the decisions he is been making. I mean, he is done some things that has concerned people. And I-it is going to be-I want him to be able to have a chance to say he is done it for this reason or done that, so I can explain to him as best I can- in a friendly way, of course-that Western values are-you know, are based upon transparency and rule of law, the right for the people to express themselves, checks and balances in government. In other words, not one part of the government is so powerful they can overwhelm all the rest of the government. And I am looking forward to doing that right there in your beautiful country. Listen, I think this is going to be my 12th meeting with President Putin. It is an important relationship that we will continue to nurture and work. You mentioned the war in Iraq and relationship. What is your personal lesson how this war in Iraq changed relationship between United States and Europe and built relation with Eastern Europe? Yes, I appreciate that very much. First of all, war is a terrible thing. And a lot of Europe supported the decision to enforce the United Nations resolutions. Remember, this was not a U.S.-you know, this came about as a result of the United Nations passing 1441, which said-and by the way, the 16th resolution to Mr. Saddam Hussein that said, Disarm, disclose, or face serious consequences. He chose not to do either, so he faced serious consequences. And a lot of Europe supported the decision to go and have him face serious consequences because the international body, the United Nations, needed to be credible when it spoke. But people need to see why the actions and why a free Iraq will make them safer. In other words, there has to be a connection. And the Eastern Europeans were great friends on this subject, and it is interesting. They understand what it means to live under tyranny. They know what it means to have secret police. And they began to smell that great freedom that comes, and then all of a sudden, democracies began to emerge. And what a fantastic example for the world, and Europe benefits with countries like the Slovak Republic a part of NATO or the European Union. I mean, these are very important lessons for people to see, that you cannot take freedom for granted, and freedom is hard, and democracy is hard work. But it is inspiring to see what is taking place in the Slovak Republic. My message to the Slovak people is, Thank you for doing what you are doing. Thank you for your courage. And freedom is a beautiful thing, and you are showing it right here. Thank you very much, ENTITY. God bless.

{"id": 547, "text": "ENTITY, can you hear me? Yes I can, Mr. ENTITY . ENTITY in San Francisco. I see you and hear you, loud and clear, sir. Go ahead. I do not know whether being fourth or fifth would be better in this round of interviews, but -- -- In baseball it is considered the best. Clean-up, clean-up hitter. Let us begin by talking about AIDS. Mr. ENTITY , drug users now represent the number one risk group for AIDS. Now, if we want to save lives, why not support the distribution of clean needles to drug addicts to prevent the spread of AIDS? Because I think, in a sense, that would encourage the drug habit. And so, I do not approve of that. I do not think that is the answer. I think education is the answer. I think the research that we are doing here at NIH and all across the country will prove to have the eventual real answer. Just as they discovered an antidote through the Salk vaccine to polio, I am confident that we will get one on AIDS. It is a little ways down the road. I worry that that would encourage drug use when we are trying to educate people off of drug use and treat those who have the addiction so that they will not use drugs. That is the reason I feel that it is not a good idea. What about condoms to teenagers now? Look, it is dealer's choice. Let them try it out there. You asked me my opinion, and I can add to it: Would I want this as a national program, something at the Federal level? No. Excuse me. What about condoms to teenagers, Mr. ENTITY ? Well, again, dealer's choice, but not for me, and not for the Federal Government. What I want to see is education. I do not think that just passing out condoms, giving up on lifestyle, giving up on family and fundamental values is correct. Indeed, I must tell you, I am worried about it. I am worried about so much filth and indecent material coming in through the airways and through these trials into people's homes. I think the American people have a right to be protected against some of these excesses. While people have a right to a fair trial, I think the American people have an overriding right to let those matters be decided behind closed doors. In terms of just national passing out condoms to people, I am not in favor of that. But I am in favor of teaching values that normally were taught in history by the family, by others pitching in, in schools and other places, to instruct and to encourage people to lifestyles that can prevent AIDS or can prevent pregnancy. That is what we need. Mr. ENTITY , do you think that Magic Johnson's admission that he is HIV-positive is going to encourage you and the administration to kick in more money for AIDS research? I do not think it is a question particularly of more money. Federal funding for research is up under our administration, and I am very proud of that. But we have a very good research team, headed by Dr. Tony Fauci and others out at NIH, and though they could use more money, and I will take a look at that in the Budget, they are not saying to me our research is starved out because of lack of funds. So, it is a question of doing as much as the Federal Government can, and taking pride in the fact that we have done more than anyone in the past, but we have got to find the answer to this question. And again, I am somewhat optimistic about that, having had a thorough briefing the other day. I will tell you what Magic's willingness to engage himself in this national commission will do: It will teach people that wayward lifestyles or just kind of unsafe sex at random is not the way it ought to work. And I think he will be witnessing to that, and I think that can have a great influence on young people in this country. I think it already has, as a matter of fact. Let us talk about the economy for a couple of minutes, Mr. ENTITY . Big corporations are now saying that they are restructuring, that these layoffs that they are going through are permanent. If that is the case, and The New York Times suggests that it is, what is the Federal Government going to do to adjust to this and to get people working again? New jobs. New jobs and new industries. And, you know, I keep coming back to it, and I think some of the people in your area understand it better than others do across this country: One thing that would help -- not entirely solve the problem -- is a capital gains tax reduction. Japan taxes it at 1 percent, Germany at zero. And we are asking our people that start up businesses to create new jobs, to go into the ball game with their hands tied behind their back. So, let the Democrats and the liberals tell me that this is a tax cut for the rich. I think it would do just exactly what needs to be done for those people whose businesses are shifting and whose businesses are changing and who lose a job because of changes in industry. That is one area. We have got some proposals for IRA's to stimulate the economy that we have had to the Congress, and I will try again on those. We have got a new highway bill tomorrow that will not solve the problem that you are talking about, the white-collar worker thrown out of work, but will help stimulate this economy by substantial amounts of Federal spending for construction projects. So, there is a lot of things working. I have accelerated $9.7 billion in Federal spending that would have been spent way back in the end of the year, and that will have an effect. But the answer is for those people that you talk about, is job retraining and new opportunities, which means economic growth. Mr. ENTITY , one final question. How about a Marshall plan for education, to get education moving? Please define what you mean by that. What we basically are trying to do in education is to try to move it along, to try and get it going again. And people are saying, Well, we need some help from the Federal Government. And the Federal Government seems to be encouraging it, but yet does not seem to be indicating there is any money available for it. Well, in the first place, Federal spending for education is way up. In the second place, Federal spending for education represents about 6 or 7 percent of the total money. Historically, and properly in my view, education spending is closest to the people. It is at the local school board level, the community level, and indeed, the State level. The Federal percentage is something like 6 or 7 percent, and it has gone up. Overall spending for education has gone from something like $115 billion 10 years ago to about $300 billion or over. I believe it is over that now. So, to those who say the answer is spending, they ought to take a look at our America 2000 education program which simply says this: Working cooperatively with Democrats, Republicans, Governors, we have defined six national education goals. And now what we are doing is saying the way to get those goals implemented is through a program called America 2000 that literally reorganizes and revolutionizes American education. And it is a good program. It is getting tremendous support in all of these States, including the State of California. So, I think the Federal Government is out front and leading. I do not think we ought to preempt the San Francisco schools. I do not think we ought to come in and say, Okay, here is your curriculum, here is your mandatory test, here is exactly how you ought to run your business. I think we have got the role defined properly, and I think it is adequately funded, though I wish we had more for it, and I know it is going to be a success. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY . Merry Christmas to you, Mr. ENTITY . Same to you and your family, and thanks a lot, and to all the people that listen to your program. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrichardbrownkgotvsanfranciscocalifornia", "title": "Interview With Richard Brown of KGO - TV in San Francisco, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-richard-brown-kgo-tv-san-francisco-california", "publication_date": "17-12-1991", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 238, "text": "ENTITY, after the customary preliminaries of reception, invited them to be seated, when at once the conversation commenced by ENTITY informing him that they were a delegation from the State Convention of South Carolina, sent there to present certain memorials of that body. These memorials had been very carefully considered in the Convention, and he believed they told exactly the truth. ENTITY inquired the object of the memorials. ENTITY informed him that one of them was in behalf of Jefferson Davis, A. H. Stephens, George A. Trenholm and Governor Magrath. He said they had understood that by the late interference of ENTITY, Messrs. Stephens and Trenholm had already been released from close confinement and permitted to return to their homes. He would ask for Governor Magrath either a pardon or that he might be released on his parole. They could assure ENTITY no harm would result from such an act of clemency. ENTITY replied that all could not be pardoned at once. The business must be proceeded with gradually, and an effort made to execute the law. A discrimination was necessary as we went along. It was a too common expression, by way of argument in regard to clemency, that such a one had been pardoned, and that he was just as bad as another who had not been pardoned. ENTITY replied that the delegation presented no such argument as that. ENTITY said sometimes the peculiar locality had much to do with pardons. Like many other things in human affairs we cannot have a fixed rule. Much depends on discretion and circumstances. If we know ourselves, we want to do what is best and just, and to show a proper degree of humanity on the part of the Government. ENTITY remarked that they had not come there to express their own hopes and desires, but as delegates from the South Carolina Convention to present the memorials of that body in a formal manner. We will, gentlemen, extend all the facilities and courtesies which the question requires. We would prefer to pardon twenty men than to refuse one. ENTITY replied, that they did not design to say anything with reference to Governor Magrath, further than that they believed much good would result by the exercise of the Executive clemency toward him. ENTITY said if they could get Governor Magrath paroled it would be a great relief to him at the present time. ENTITY thanked ENTITY for having released Messrs. Stephens and Trenholm. We have thus far, then, anticipated your memorial. ENTITY said Mr. Trenholm was one of their most useful men, and there was no doubt he would exert all his power with a view to entire harmony between the State and the Government. ENTITY replied that he understood that was so; adding, if treason was committed, there ought to be some test to determine the power of the Government to punish the crime. He was free to say that it was not a mere contest between political parties, or a question as to de facto governments. Looking at the Government as we do, the laws violated, and an attempt made at the life of the nation, there should be a vindication of the Government and the Constitution, even if the pardoning power were exercised thereafter. If treason has been committed, it ought to be determined by the highest tribunal, and the fact declared, even if clemency should come afterward. There was no malice or prejudice in carrying out that duty. ENTITY remarked they were well aware of that. ENTITY resuming, said there might be some unkind feeling on this subject, but it did not exist to any great extent ENTITY said, although not instructed by the Convention, he was induced to ask whether Mrs. Jefferson Davis, who was now confined to Georgia, could not cross into South Carolina to see her friends. ENTITY replied that he had received letters from Mrs. Davis, but they were not very commendable. The tone of one of them, however, was considerably improved, but the others were not of the character beseeming one asking leniency. ENTITY interposed by saying she was a woman of strong feeling. Yes; I suppose she is a woman of strong feeling and temper, but there is no intention to persecute her. There is as much magnanimity and independence, and nobleness of spirit, in submitting, as in trying to set the Government at defiance. True magnanimity takes things as they are, and when taken in the proper way I disconnect them from humiliation. Manifestations of temper and defiance do no good. ENTITY remarked that the tone of the newspapers was more favorable, and different from what it was. He then asked if ENTITY had seen a copy of the amended Constitution of South Carolina. Of course he had seen they accepted emancipation. He felt perfectly satisfied that the person and property of the negro would be protected, and spoke of the great difficulties of regulating labor and restraining vagrancy, etc. ENTITY remarked that they had a deep consciousness of the truth of all president said. ENTITY, resuming, observed that the character of an individual may characterize a nation, which is nothing but an aggregate of individuals; and when a proper spirit is manifested, all can act harmoniously. The man who goes to the stake is almost dignified by his bearing: it lifts him above humiliation. In these cases, gentlemen, we will do the best we can. While there is sympathy, there is a public judgment which must be met But, I assure you, gentlemen, no disposition exists for persecution, or thirst for blood. ENTITY thought many of the evils would disappear if they inaugurated the right system. Pass laws protecting the colored man in his person and property, and he can collect his debts. He knew how it was in the South. The question when first presented of putting a colored man in the witness stand, made them shrug their shoulders. But the colored man's testimony was to be taken for what it is worth by those who examined him, and the jury who hear it. After all, there was not so much danger as was supposed. Those coming out of slavery cannot do without work; they cannot lie down in dissipation; they must work; they ought to understand that liberty means simply the right to work and enjoy the products of labor, and that the laws protect them. That being done, and when we come to the period to feel that men must work or starve, the country will be prepared to receive a system applicable to both white and black-prepared to receive a system necessary to the case. A short time back you could not enforce the vagrant law on the black, but could on the white man. But get the public mind right and you can treat both alike. Let us get the general principles, and the details and collaterals will follow. We must be practical, and come up to surrounding circumstances. ENTITY, ENTITY and ENTITY, all expressed to ENTITY their conviction that the State had accepted in good faith the result of the issue which had been made; that the people felt that ENTITY had stood between them and a harsh use of the power of the Government; that they felt entire confidence in his purposes and actions, and hoped, in return, to entitle themselves to his confidence as to their feelings and actions. ENTITY replied, he was glad to hear it; that whenever such mutual confidence existed, there would, he thought, be an open road to the restoration of good feeling and a prosperous condition and that if he knew himself, and he thought he did, he would recommend nothing but what would advance their interests. So far from pandering or looking to future elevation, he must be believed, when he said he had not an eye single to such preferment. If, he continued, I could be instrumental in restoring the Government to its former relation, and see the people once more united and happy, I should feel that I had more than filled the measure of my ambition. If I could feel that I had contributed to this in any degree, my heart would be more than gratified, and my ambition full. Every man in South Carolina would respond to that. I am sure there is on their part no Punic faith. They deserve your confidence, and I am sure they will earn it. ENTITY expressed himself gratified with what had been said by these gentlemen. ENTITY remarked that all South Carolina reposed confidence in ENTITY, and that the memorials presented by the Chairman of the delegation represented the true sentiments of the people of that State, both in regard to those whom they wished pardoned and the feeling and position of South Carolina.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjudgewardlowalfredhugercoloneldawkinsandwhtrescottsouthcarolina", "title": "Interview with Judge Wardlow, Alfred Huger, Colonel Dawkins and W.H.

{"id": 19, "text": ", I know your time is valuable. Let me start my recorder here. The first thing I wanted to ask you, there have only been a couple of times in this century that Congress has come together, got their heads together enough, both sides of the Congress, to come together and pass legislation to give somebody citizenship. It happened with Winston Churchill, a few other people. I wanted to know if Congress does-it looks like the first thing they are going to do when they come back into town is work on the Elian Gonzalez case. If they did pass a private bill in both Houses and they feel like politically they have got enough backing to do that, what would you do with that bill if it got to your desk? I do not know. I have not thought about it. I think it would be-this is not Winston Churchill, for one thing. You know, I do not think that Congress should put its-unless they know more about the facts than I do, I do not think they should put themselves in the position of making a decision that runs contrary to what the people who have had to do all the investigation have done. I think that, obviously, if they believe the INS made a mistake, their decision is subject to challenge in Federal court. And the Congress-even Members of Congress can petition to be heard there. But I think that we are setting a-I think that it would irrevocably lead people to the conclusion that this was much more about politics than it was whether that little boy ought to be taken away from his father. They are basically taking a position that if you live in Cuba, if we can take you away from your father, you are better off-your parents. And I think that is -the INS reached a different decision, having exhaustively looked at what was best for that child. As you all know, I have no sympathy for the Castro regime. I signed the present bill. I think it is tragic how they have blown every conceivable opportunity to get closer to the United States. Just as we were making progress, they murdered those pilots. So I am not sympathetic there. But I think that we need to think long and hard whether we are going to take the position that any person who comes to our shores who is a minor, any minor child who loses his or her parents should never be sent home to another parent, even if that parent is capable of doing a very good job, if we do not like the Government of the country where the people lived. And again, I say I am not-I have no brief for the Castro government or for many of their policies. I think the way he has attempted to politicize this is also terrible. It is not just the Cuban-Americans that have attempted to politicize it. He has responded by attempting to politicize it. So this poor little boy is 6 years old. He has scars from his mother's death of which he can only be dimly aware. And making a judgment about what is in his best interest and what is most likely to give him a stable, healthy, whole childhood and allow him to grow into an adult as a solid person, I am sure, may not be free of difficulty. And I just think that the decision ought to be made, insofar as possible, independent of countervailing political pressures. , the State of the Union is right around the corner, so I guess is the State of the Union part of the interview. In the previews that you all have made available of what is coming up, it seems like most of it is beefing up programs that you already have, like today's announcement, and returning to-- It is quite a beef up. This is the biggest thing ever done-yes-- Quite a beef up-which is-or trying to get back to unfinished business. And I was wondering whether you were planning on trying to go for some new breakthrough issue this year, or whether that is not really possible in a last year. Oh, I think that when you see everything we recommend in the aggregate, you might think that in terms of specifics, it is the most ambitious set of proposals since my first year. Last year was a very ambitious speech, but in terms of what I asked the Congress to do, it required some willingness on their part to meet with me and work through a joint position on Social Security, for example, or joint position on Medicare. I still think we may get a joint position on Medicare, and we may get part way there on Social Security. I am still going to try to persuade them to take all the interest savings that we get from not spending the Social Security surplus and putting that in the Trust Fund; that will take Social Security out to 2050, beyond the life of the baby boom generation. So I am still not sure we will not make that, but if you just look at the specific policy proposals I will make, not just in the unfinished business area but in the new area-and the unfinished business is important. I mean, you have got the Patients' Bill of Rights, closing the gun show loophole, and banning the import of large ammunition clips. You have got the minimum wage. You have got the hate crimes legislation, the Employment Non- Discrimination Act, the prescription drug for Medicare. So we have got a huge-even though we got a great deal done at the very end of the last Congress, there is a big unfinished business list. And then, as you know, I have been rolling out a lot of these new proposals. And actually, there will be a couple of things that will be quite new that I am not prepared to release yet. But I will have a couple of new proposals. But I think that the most important thing to me is to keep the country moving in this direction and aggressively embracing change, the right kind of change. That, I think, is critical to keep the recovery going, to keep bringing more people into the process of prosperity, and to keep bringing the country together. I think that is very important. So a lot of what I will recommend that is new is certainly consistent with what I have been doing for 7 years. I came to office with a very clear idea of where I thought America was off base, what I thought we ought to do, what kind of governing strategy I would have. And I believe that it is working. And I think people- some people will say, Well, he does things in increments. But if you walk down the road 7 years and you look back-I mean, if I told you 7 years ago, after 12 years of quadrupling the national debt, I will give you in year 6 and 7 the first back-to-back balanced budget surpluses in 42 years, from a $300 billion debt, you'd say that is not an incremental change; that is a big change. But you do those things in small steps. If you look at the millions of people-we have cut the welfare rolls about in half-it happened in incremental steps. But it is a huge thing in the aggregate. And all the economic changes- we have got the lowest African-American, Hispanic unemployment rate ever recorded, the lowest female unemployment rate in 40 years, lowest poverty rate in 20 years, lowest single parent household poverty rate in 46 years. So you take it in steps, but if you keep walking in the same direction, all of a sudden your steps constitute a giant leap forward. In that larger mosaic, how do you-of your record and your legacy in what you have done incrementally-down the road, how important will it be if, 15 years from now, we have not made significant advances on the debt? I mean, already your budget soon will break the '97 Balanced Budget Act. And certainly the surpluses are far greater than was predicted at that time. But how will history judge this generation of leadership if significant-- I think we should pay the debt off. And I think we should do it in 15 years. And the proposals that I will make are consistent with that, based on our latest numbers. Now, I have two things to say about the '97 budget caps. They were very severe, and they were thoroughly shredded by the Republican majority last year by turning everything into an emergency. I mean, the census was an emergency; Head Start was an emergency; continuing defense expenditures were emergencies. So the caps are not disappearing this year; the caps were shredded last year. So the real question is-the question I asked our people to look at, and we spent lots of time on it the end of last year-is whether we could present to the Congress a budget that was not full of gimmicks, that reflected what the Congress spent last year, inflation in areas where with-had that-for example, in the defense area where we know they intended-and still could we do that based on what we now believe the figures are and what our costs are in health care programs and other things and still get this country out of debt in 15 years and still not spend the Social Security surplus. And the answer, we believe, is yes, that you can avoid spending the Social Security surplus, continue to get the country out of debt in 15 years, and have a spending program for the next 5 years that reflects the decisions made by the Congress in the last year, without all those gimmicks. And you could still have a modest tax cut, nothing anywhere near the high end of what people had talked about in the campaign and what the Congress tried to do last year, but you could still have a modest one. So I think this is an honest budget that is fiscally responsible and still gets us out of debt. And I believe that we ought to embrace these big challenges, and I think that our children will judge us very well if we do and somewhat harshly if we do not . Because in my lifetime- you have heard me say this over and over again, but I am not young any more. I am 53 years old. In my lifetime we have never had this combination of economic prosperity, social progress, national self-confidence, with the absence of internal crisis or external threat. Not that we have no problems at home or no threats abroad, but none of it is sufficient to derail us from trying to imagine the future and then go after it. And it seems the one-that one of the elements of that future ought to be a commitment to take America out of debt. Another element of the future ought to be a commitment from going to-what I said today-trying to make our country the safest big country in the world. Another element of that future ought to be trying to prove that we can grow the economy and dramatically reduce the global warming by maximizing technology. We ought to be able to prove that we can equalize the economic opportunity, that we can-without holding anybody back, that we ought to be able to bring economic opportunity to these poor people in poor places that have not had it. And I think in all those areas, in the education area, in the health care area, I think we will be judged by whether we made the most of what is truly a magic moment. The last time we had this sustained rate of economic growth with low inflation was in the early sixties, about 40 years ago. And if you look at the indicators now, compared to then in the aggregate, I think you would say our economy is stronger today, but there were a couple of years there where unemployment averaged under 4 percent and without much inflation. And it all came apart, first trying to come to grips with the civil rights crisis at home and then trying to pay for the war on poverty and the war for equal opportunity and civil rights and the war in Vietnam abroad. So that, basically, we had a moment there that we lost, not only because we became divided as a people politically but because our system simply could not accommodate building the America of our dreams. So what do you see as a threat to that? I mean, if the Vietnam period and all of that was a threat, what is the threat to that now? I do not think there is one. That is why I think we have no excuse not to really-this should be a truly historic moment in America. I cannot think of any time in our history when we have had this sort of opportunity. You might argue that it was similar, that the times which produced Theodore Roosevelt's administration, and then Woodrow Wilson's, were similar, where we were an emerging global power, we were basically at peace, where the world was becoming more integrated. You go back and read McKinley's speeches around the turn of the century-he was the first President of the last century-he said a lot of this. It is quite interesting. And so you might argue that that was a time like this. But I think that-and I think it is a time in our history that most closely parallels this. If you go back to the early 19th century, you can find historical parallels in the exploration of Lewis and Clark and the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory. But the world was so different then, it is hard to do. So I just do not think we ever have had a time like this. It is not to say we have no foreign crises or security threats. We do. But they can all be managed. And the cost of managing them now is not inconsistent with what our obligations are in science and technology, in education, in economic opportunity, across the range of other areas. , you spoke a while ago about how you wanted to keep pushing for change. And I was thinking what is happened to minorities under your administration, that they have seen a pretty drastic improvement in their standard of living because of the strong economy. But one could also say that attitudes toward race maybe have not changed that much. And I was wondering whether there was something that you thought you could still do about attitudes towards race in your last year. Well, I think they have-first of all, I dispute the premise. I think they have changed. I think that we continue to see evidence that it is still a real problem. I mean, the unfortunate comments that the Atlanta baseball player made, that is really troubling. On the other hand, the fact that Hank Aaron and Andy Young met with him is encouraging. I mean, you know, 30 years ago that would not have happened. I think-last night I watched-I was working on the State of the Union last night, and I had basketball on, on TV, muted. And I was watching the Minnesota Timberwolves play the Indiana Pacers. And they beat them on a buzzer-beater shot. And then they interviewed Kevin Garnett, who is a very young man. I think he is the highest paid player in basketball, but he is very young, did not finish college. And they asked him what Dr. King meant to him, and how his life had changed, and you could just see- of course, 30 years ago no young African-American would be making that kind of money and would have the kind of slant he had. So I think things are changing. But I think what I have to do-I think there are three things generally I should be doing. Number one, I think we have to continue to try to close the differential in education and economic advancement. For example, the African-American high school graduation rate right now is about equal to the white, non-Hispanic high school rate, which is quite extraordinary. But the college-going rate is different. And the Hispanic dropout rate is still quite a bit higher, largely because of the immigrants, first-immigrants. So I think that this economic empowerment agenda I have, and the education agenda, the Hispanic education initiative, all those things, closing those gaps, that is important. Number two, I think we need to continue to have a vigorous enforcement of the law and highlighting those things we do not agree with. And number three, I think we have to continue the activities of the President's Office on One America. I think we need to continue to appoint more people from different backgrounds. We need to continue to have more meetings. We need to continue to highlight the problems. And I need to continue to speak out and work on this in America. I said three, but I like to say the fourth thing is I think that when our country continues its mission to try to end racial and ethnic and tribal and religious conflicts around the world, I think that has a reverberating effect here at home. I can give you just one very concrete example. Chelsea and I went to Kosovo together, and we went to the military camp. And you have this highly racial and ethnically diverse American military, very conscious of what they were doing in Kosovo and trying to end ethnic cleansing, and also very aware that insofar as they work together and live together and create a genuine community where everybody was treated equally, the power of their example could have as big an impact on the people of Kosovo as the force of their arms. So I do not think this-this is the sort of work that may never be done, since in all of human history we have not succeeded in rooting out people's fear or suspicion of those who are different. And there always will be those radicals which seek to advance themselves by demonizing groups of others. But I think we are doing better there. I think we are doing-and I think there is a lot more we can do. The Chinese Army's daily newspaper has signaled its willingness to aggressively use the Internet as a venue for warfare, to attack our military websites and our military-attack us through on-line methods. You in your critical infrastructure report recently sort of achieved parity with that and-with your ROTC Corps idea and that sort of thing. But I am wondering what precedents that sets. Even what we did in the conflict with Serbia, the precedents that that sets is sort of like fighting each other, attacking each other's satellites. Are you concerned about the precedent that using on-line warfare in any form will have for future generations, since we are the most vulnerable set on the planet from E-commerce to a lot of our Government installations? Because we are more open, you mean? Yes sir, because we are more open. And more Internet-- So we bring down-in a hypothetical conflict, we bring down the PLA's air defense system, and they just take out our 911 systems and all that-turn out all the lights at every 7-Eleven in the country. Well, I think, first of all, it is unrealistic to think that such systems would not be the targets of our adversaries. I think they are far more likely to be the targets of terrorists, organized criminals, narcotraffickers, than other countries. I believe that the answer is that we have got to be as strong as we possibly can be in the whole area of cyberspace safety. We have got to be as resistant to cyberterrorism and assault as we possibly can. And interestingly enough, this is something we get to practice on every day a lot, because every day there are always people trying to break into our computers, break into the Defense Department computers, break into various security computers. And so we get to work at it every day. And we have given a lot of thought to how you protect power systems, how you protect telephone systems, how you protect financial records. And so all I can say is that the question you asked confirms what I said at the National Academy of Sciences, I guess over a year ago. I think that is when I spoke there. We have got to be prepared to deal with the explosion of technology in ways that could threaten our security, not only on data systems themselves. Another thing you are going to see-everything involving technology is getting smaller, the miniaturization of everybody. Everybody's got their little notepads now. I just got the Palm Pilot. He is way ahead. You ought to see old Kris's Palm Pilot. It is got everything from his great grandfather's birthplace-I just saw the newest AT&T and Nokia telephone that fits right inside the palm of the hand. Now, that same miniaturization process is bound to go on with weapons. So you are not only going to have the attempt that you mentioned to invade, to invade telecommunication systems and computer systems, but you are also going to have a miniaturization system that will affect chemical and biological weapons and other sophisticated traditional weapons, which will make them harder to detect, easier to use, easier to comport. You may have composite materials that do not show up on airport scanners. All these things are going to happen. That is why we are going to make cars out of different materials, make weapons out of different materials. And in the whole history of combat among nation-states and before that, feudal groups or tribal groups, the normal thing that happens is a weapons system will be developed, and it will enjoy a period of success, and then a defense will be developed to it, and then there will be equilibrium until a new weapons system is developed that will give some dominance, and then you will have some equilibrium. What we are trying to do with this massive investment we are making against bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, nuclear terrorism, cyberterrorism, is to collapse the timespan between offense and defense. One of the things, for example, that we really hope that will come out of the human genome is that we will be able to develop software programs that will immediately adjust the antidote for certain viruses. If there is a biological warfare attack and you have got a mad scientist somewhere who changes the-I am just making this up- but who changes the anthrax virus, for example, in some way it is never before been changed, and so then this person-and then they spread it over 400 people in some town, and they begin to come around-what we are attempting to do with the human genome project, what I think one of the corollary benefits will be is that you will have software packages developed so that you will be able to immediately analyze that, and someone will tell you exactly how you would have to modify the antidote to anthrax to meet the new strain that is resistant to all known antidotes. So this whole struggle, as things change faster and faster and faster and you have the miniaturization of weapons systems to parallel with the miniaturization of other communication systems, will be to keep closing the gap between offense and defense until there is close to no difference as possible. That is the struggle for security in the 21st century. And I have tried to put America on that path. Without frightening the American people, without raising alarm bells, I have tried to make sure that when I left office we would have in place a properly funded, properly staffed system to prepare for the security threats of the 21st century. All the press goes to the highdollar hardware systems-should we have a strategic defense initiative, a missile defense. , we are running out of time here, so do you mind if we move on to some other topic? This is a big issue. All I am saying is-I am not-missile defense is important if we can do it. And missile threat is important. But you should know that I consider both the cyberthreats and the miniaturization of these other threats very significant. But I do believe when I leave office we will have for my successor and for our country a system that will enable us to deal with it. Since you are talking to the Christian Science Monitor, we are interested in your spiritual journey, which you have mentioned a couple times. And you have talked about how amazed you have been by the power of forgiveness, especially in the last 18 months. And I was wondering if you could share with us what your own spiritual growth has been. Have you found any Bible passages particularly dear? Have you found any concepts that you have held onto that have helped promote your own spiritual growth? Could you just describe what is been happening with your own growth in the last 18 months? Well, this is a subject I think people in public life should address with some amount of humility and reluctance, not because people should not be willing to affirm their faith but because we should remember the story that Christ told, in effect, bragging about the people that prayed in their closets instead of on the street corner. So I say that with all-but having said that, I think the thing that has struck me is that in this journey I have made to try to- that really has been a lifetime journey for me, and it is certainly something that is deepened since I have been President and something that I had to really focus on the last 2 years-I think the thing that I have really had to work on is trying to gain some spiritual anchor that will enable me to give up resentments and disappointment and anger and to understand that in seeking forgiveness I had to learn to forgive. It is easy to ask for forgiveness. A lot of people think it is hard, but I think it is -when you plainly need it, it is easy enough to ask for. But we are taught over and over again that we cannot get it unless we give it. And I think what is-you know, there is the wonderful Scripture where people are admonished to forgive those not just in the same measure that they are forgiven but 70 times 7. I think that what I have gained more than anything else is a certain humility in recognizing how important forgiveness is, but how it does not count and it cannot count unless you can give it as well as ask for it. And that basically- I used to see life as a struggle for always learning more things, cramming more things in my head, anywhere I could do more things, you know. Now I see the search for wisdom and strength is also a process of letting go. A lot of things you have to let go of. And I have been helped a lot by a lot of these ministers that have met with me and the Scriptures they have given me to read; by a lot of Christians and even sects of Christians have written me around the country with tracts on forgiveness, how you merit it in what you do and how you have to give it in turn; and also a number of people with whom I have worked as President. I learned a lot-I have had on more than one occasion the opportunity to talk to Mr. Mandela about how he came to forgive those who were his oppressors, you know, and how he felt about it and how he-what kind of forgiveness he ever sought for himself. I have really tried to deal with this in a very serious way, and I think I have learned quite a lot about myself in the process. And it is an ongoing effort. But I have to remember every day that human nature is so prone to find self-respect in some element of one's character that you think is superior to someone else, and a lot of this is a matter of letting go. You just have to learn to let that go, just get up every day, try to do the best you can, be the best person you can be, and continue that individual journey of growth. And I work on it-hard. And it is been a very humbling experience, but I think very much worthwhile for me, personally. Mr. Lockhart is giving me the one-morequestion signal, so I thought what I might do is use an old Wolf Blitzer trick which is-- Which is what-ask three questions? Ask a question with the second question. Well, briefly, you mentioned Chelsea just a moment ago. And as you know, the White House can be a pretty tough place on first kids. But the thing you always hear everybody talk about is the poise and the grace that she has now as a young woman. I am wondering basically what you attribute that to, and how you feel the press has been on her-if they have kind of been giving her a fair shake as the kind of parameters were laid out from the very beginning? And secondly, not at all related to that, is you were heavily criticized for the FALN commutations, and there is a lot of irony in that, in that you are the least pardoning President in the modern history. You have issued fewer pardons that any President in the modern era. I am wondering why you have not availed yourself of that Presidential power more, since aside from the FALN thing, there is typically very little fallout for that, using that power. Well, let me say first, I think- let me answer the first question first. Say exactly what you asked me about Chelsea again. The thing you hear everybody talking-- Oh, how the press treated her. How the press treated her, but how she, under the hothouse environment that the White House can be, with all the looking in-- I feel, first of all, very grateful that even though I do not agree with everything- first of all, I think it is impossible to generalize about the press, and it will become harder and harder to refer to something called the press. Where is the press in the publications in the merger of America Online and Time Warner, right? So I am always reluctant-I sort of knew what that was, I thought, when I got elected. I am not sure I know what that is anymore. But I think that, by and large, all elements of the press, with some very few exceptions, have been willing to let my daughter have her life and try to grow up and deal with all the challenges that entails and the extra burdens of her parents being in public life and all the controversies and ups and downs we have exhibited, without trying to shine the glare on her. And I am profoundly grateful for that, because I think every young person needs the chance to find his or her own way to maturity. And it is very difficult when your parents are as publicly exposed and prominent in daily life as her parents are. And it is made more difficult if you are prematurely turned into a public figure. I think to some extent she is one anyway, whether she is in the press or not. But I think basically the press has been sensitive to that. And I am profoundly grateful for that. And I hope that the life that her parents have lived in public life has been-has offered more good than bad for her, as a child growing up. And she is a young woman now, and I hope that, on balance, it is been a positive thing. We love her very much, and we hope that it is - and believe that, on balance, it is been good. On the related question of the pardons. Let me say about-- Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. She is going to get a pardon. I want to say something here that nobody has ever given me a chance to say in public before. This is important to me. And I have been working on this hard. I did not know until-ironically, until the controversy over the FALN thing that I had, apparently, both commuted fewer sentences and issued fewer pardons than my predecessors. I did not know that, but you should know what my generic attitude is. Generically, I believe a President should rarely commute sentences and should have good reasons for doing so if he does, knowing that that will always be somewhat controversial-that is, if you attenuate a jury or a judge's sentence. That is what I did in the FALN case. I did it after Chuck Ruff, my lawyer, did an extensive survey. I thought it might be controversial. I regret it became as controversial as it was. I still think, based on the facts of those cases, I did the right thing. I still believe strongly that I did the right thing. And I can tell you categorically there was no politics in it, that Chuck Ruff handled this, and everything he says about it is true. I think everyone knows him as being an extremely truthful person. He handled it entirely, and only he handled it. And then he dealt with me on it. Now should we do some more commutations? Perhaps we should. But I think I would probably always be on the low side of that. On the other hand, I tend to have a much more generous attitude on pardons, particularly because under the Federal system-I think people ought to get their voting rights back; I do not think they ought to be discriminated about in getting jobs or keeping jobs or getting contracts if they have discharged their sentence and they have been out in law-abiding society. Now, over time, before I ever got there, there developed a whole apparatus in the Justice Department which is its own independent bureaucracy for evaluating these things. And the tradition is that the President does not rule on them, one way or the other, until you get all these recommendations sent to you. And I think what I believe is that-although this operation has a life of its own, I have asked-I have tried to review it now because my instinct is that we should be granting more pardons. I do not mean we should just be cavalier. I mean if you still think somebody might be involved in something wrong-not so much to wipe away the past as to free people up to live in the present and future. There are all kinds of-suppose when you are 18 you commit some offense which gets you a 5-year sentence. And suppose-and let us suppose under the sentencing guidelines then applicable, you served 2 years of the sentence. Well, my view is if you served the 2 years, then you get out, and you have got 3 years on parole. So the 5 years is discharged. Then you have to serve-then you live a couple more years, and you have a totally exemplary life. I do not think that your past mistake should unduly cramp your present and future life. If you do something really terrible, you are going to be in prison for a long time. But I mean, people are just getting out all the time- 90 percent of the people who go to jail get out. When they get out, we do not have a vested interest in seeing them continue to be punished. Our interest as citizens, after they pay their debt to society, is to see them be successful. I mean, when somebody pays, then when they get out, surely we do not want them to keep on paying. If they have to keep on paying, that is why you end up with more crime and a less successful, less healthy society. So my instinct is that-again, I speak for myself; each President will be different on this- is that the President should be pretty reluctant to shorten sentences but should be willing to do so in appropriate cases; but that the President should be more forthcoming in being willing to grant pardons when it is not really for the purpose of pretending that it did not happen but of liberating people to make the most of their todays and tomorrows, because every single American has a big stake in people who actually do get punished later going on and living their lives in a straight and effective way. So that is my take on this. And we are looking to see whether there are any kind of changes we can make to be more effective in that regard. Thanks. I am glad you asked me. You are the only person who ever asked me that.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfrancinekieferandskipthurmanthechristiansciencemonitorboston", "title": "Interview With Francine Kiefer and Skip Thurman of the Christian Science Monitor in Boston", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-francine-kiefer-and-skip-thurman-the-christian-science-monitor-boston", "publication_date": "18-01-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 212, "text": "ENTITY, good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Important day for you, the Democrats, Republicans, and independents. It is election day, and you know, they give frequent flyer miles on Air Force One, you are going to get a free trip to anywhere. You have been busy. Well, it is been a busy week. But you know, I had to take that very important trip to the Middle East, and when I came back, a lot of our candidates asked me to get out there and campaign, including Governor Cuomo, so I tried to do all I could to make the best argument for why we are moving our country in the right direction and we do not want to go back to the policies that failed us before in the eighties. So this morning I am just taking a last opportunity to encourage the American people to go out and vote, to make their voices heard today. The stakes in this election are quite high, as they always are in any midterm election, but especially in this one. So I hope the people within the sound of my voice will exercise their citizenship today and get out there and vote. Interesting contrast for you; maybe you can talk about it for just a second, between the events of the Middle East and our political system and the fact that the peace treaty signing coming so close to our election. Well, of course, we have been working on that very hard for a couple of years. It is just a coincidence that it came as close as it did to our election. But I would hope that it would remind the American people of the great potential of this country and the greatness of this country. And I hope it would keep our people in a positive frame of mind. One of the unfortunate aspects of so much of modern campaigning is that the negative tends to outweigh the positive, and the negative television ads, the whole business about the tone and tenor of our elections. This is actually quite a great country with a great past and an even greater future if the people who are going to be affected by it will invest in it and vote for it and vote for people who will build the country, not just place blame, vote for people who will keep moving us into the future. That is really the lesson of the Middle East, that people want the United States involved in the peacemaking and the problem solving of the world, whether in the Middle East or in Haiti or Northern Ireland, just to name three, because they think we have a good system and that we are a good people. And sometimes I think we forget it, and we need to remember it. This is election day. We can go out, be heard, and make a difference. As a man that has spent his entire life in politics, how do you define politics? Is it program or is it more the essence and the basics of hope, security, fulfillment? Well, I think the programs matter, but I also think the principles matter. I think giving voice to people's hopes to getting people together, giving energy to other people is very important. So much of what we do down here in Washington basically is an effort to empower people to take responsibility for their own lives. There are not so many things that the Government does directly. I mean, we pay for medical care for the elderly through Medicare. We finance the Social Security system. We run a wonderful National Park System. We do a number of other things directly, but a lot of what we do is to empower people: the student loan program, the Head Start program, the crime bill which enables the city of New York to hire more police officers and have programs for kids to keep them out of trouble. All these things basically give people in their individual, family, or community lives the ability to take responsibility for themselves. So part of it is programs, but a lot of it is setting the right tone and the right direction, looking to the future all the time. This country is always at its best when it is coming together and moving to the future. I hear a frustration in your voice about the mood of the country, the cynicism, the negative advertising that is taking place on all sides in the past weeks. Well, I do not know that I am frustrated. I think it has too much sway over our national life, but I think our communications in general with one another are too negative these days. We ought to be having more honest conversations with one another and doing less verbal bomb-throwing. I think the American people are frustrated by it, and that is why I hope that there will be a good turnout today for candidates like Mario Cuomo who have essentially been a positive force throughout their public careers. Because it is just so easy to give in to the kind of pounding-attack communications that tend to dominate not just the elections but often the daily communication of our public life. And it is not a very good way to run a railroad or a country, and we are better than that. And whatever happens today in these elections, I am going to be determined over the next few years to try to lift our country out of that. ENTITY on the Rambling With Gambling phone this morning. Along those lines, if, as predicted by some, the Republicans gain control of the Senate, will your agenda for the next couple of years have to change? No, but I will have to have more responsible bipartisan efforts on all parts. I will make my effort, and we will see others make theirs, I hope. On the other hand, if the American people turn out in equal numbers, if the Democrats turn out as well as the Republicans do at the polls today, I do not think that'll happen. It is really, in so much measure, a question of who cares enough to go and vote and whether the spirits of a lot of normally Democratic voters are dampened by the negative atmosphere of the moment. You know, the country's economy is coming back, we are tackling our problems like crime, we are facing things long ignored, and this is a time to keep going forward. Where do you vote today? Do you vote in Arkansas by Yes. I voted absentee in Arkansas. I voted for my Governor, and I called him last night and told him I did. Well, that is good. The security question, the events of the last couple of weeks I understand and I am not looking for specifics here but just generalities I understand your routine has changed a little bit. Well, we have asked the Secret Service to take a look at all the procedures and everything, as they periodically do. Every year, I think for quite a long while now, Secret Service has increased its ability to protect the President, and I think they are continuing to do it. I have a lot of confidence in them, and the trick is to permit them to do that without having the President completely cut off from the public at large, because this is a great, free society, and one of the problems the President always has is trying to avoid losing touch. Exactly. Probably the most difficult thing, you have got to keep in touch with the folks. I want to thank you very much, ENTITY, for choosing us this morning to talk about politics on election day, 1994. Thank you very much. Thanks again. I want to urge all your listeners to go on and vote today. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjohngamblingworradionewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With John Gambling of WOR Radio, New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-john-gambling-wor-radio-new-york-city", "publication_date": "08-11-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 216, "text": "Thanks so much for being with us, ENTITY. Thank you, ENTITY. Great to be here. You unveil your regulatory reform proposal tomorrow, and from what we know it is a little bit different than some had anticipated; less consolidation of agencies than had been predicted. We have heard about turf fights among regulators and committee chairs in Congress. Does that mean in the final decision making that you listened more to political advice about what you could get done rather than what made the most sense and was most efficient economically? No. I think that what we focused on was, number one, do we have the tools to prevent the kinds of risks that we saw back in September? And our conclusion was we did not , and we had to make sure that we had a systemic risk regulator. So that is in place. We asked, do we have the resolution authority if an individual institution like an AIG breaks down, to quarantine them so that they are not bringing the whole system down? We did not have that authority; we wanted to put that in place. Did we have a means of anticipating problems and properly regulating the nonbank sector of the financial system, which obviously has grown massively over the last decade? And we concluded we did not have that power. So we got those things in place. Were we sufficiently focused on consumers? And it turned out that consumer protection, investor protection was scattered among a whole bunch of different agency; we wanted to streamline, consolidate and give somebody line responsibility for that. So what we have started off with was identifying what were the biggest problems that we had, and are we putting in place the tools to prevent the kind of crises that we have seen from happening again? But you do not Now have a single bank regulator, and some people have talked about judge shopping among banks for favorable regulation. This is something that we have been concerned about in the past. What we do have, under our proposal, is that for tier one institutions, the big institutions who, if they fail, require us to shore them up, for those folks they are going to be under a single regulatory body. When it comes to some of the smaller banks, community banks, the FDIC has done a good job on that, and we feel confident that they can continue doing what they do. So our overall concept has been not to completely abandon those aspects of the system that worked, but rather focus on those aspects of the system that did not , try to close gaps. Did, you know, any considerations of sort of politics play into it? We want to get this thing passed, and, you know, we think that speed is important. We want to do it right. We want to do it carefully. But we do not want to tilt at windmills, we want to make sure that we are getting the best possible regulatory framework in place so that we are not repeating the mistakes of the past. We know that the dynamism of capitalism comes from the interplay of risk and reward. Yeah. With this plan, you want to achieve what you think will be a healthier balance. Right. You have talked about other interventions as and used words like temporary Right. reluctant to do it Right. surgical interventions. Right. But when you add it all up AIG, Citigroup, Fannie and Freddie, the auto companies, executive compensation guidelines do you ever wonder that it is just too much messing with the engine of capitalism, and that it is going to get hard to stop messing with it? No. And I will tell you why. Most of these interventions did not start on my watch. So the auto companies, let us take as a good example, when I came in, we had already put in not me, but the previous administration had already put in $10 billion to shore up the auto companies and asked nothing for in return. Now, I had three choices. I could continue giving them money without asking anything in return, I could let them liquidate in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, or we could say, `We do not want to run your company. Would you show us a plan that allows you to stand on your own two feet, so that what we are providing is a meaningful bridge for you to get to a better future?' We chose option three. That is not something that we welcomed, and the sooner we can get out the better. I would contrast that with this financial regulatory proposal that we are putting forward. There what we are trying to do is increase the transparency and the openness that has been the signature characteristic of our sorry. Sorry, I am going to start over. I am going to start at I will contrast. Get out of here. That is the most persistent fly I have ever seen. Nice! Now, where were we? That was pretty impressive, was not it? I got it. I got the sucker. What do you think, Gibbs? That is very good. It is on it is right there. Right there. You want to film that? There it is. You were contrasting the other interventions with Right. So the so with the autos, we want to get out as soon as possible. Yeah. And I would love nothing better than to let the auto companies operate, thrive, manage themselves without us being involved. Financial regulation, I think, is different, because what we have proposed is to essentially update those regulatory tools that existed back in the 1930s that were put in place after the Great Depression to increase transparency and openness. But I think everybody would acknowledge that if we have got rules of the road, that is what makes American capitalism thrive. That is why people invest in this country because they have confidence that, if they read a prospectus, somebody's made sure that what is in there is true. If they take out a loan, that there are laws in place to make sure that they are protected. And, you know, unfortunately the growth of the nonbank sector as well as all the complexities and financial instruments outstripped those old regulatory regimes. If we can get that right, that, I think, is a permanent improvement that will enhance and not impede the operation of the free market. Many people think that for major domestic reforms like health care, that for it to be durable and successful you need bipartisan support. Do you believe that? And is it important enough to you that you are willing to tell liberals in your party that they need to accept a compromise on the so-called public option, either a co-op alternative, a fallback or one of the things that is been discussed. Well, let us focus first of all on health care, and I will talk about energy as well. My general principle is I always want bipartisan support. Whether I get bipartisan support or not for any given proposal isn'talways up to me, it has to do with the short-term political calculus and thetactics that the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans determine. WhatI do have control over is accepting bipartisan ideas, bipartisan policies. So on health care, for example, there are already a bunch of liberals who are disappointed because I did not propose a single payer plan. What I have said is that without having, despite what is been advertised, a government takeover of health care, that is not what we are we have called for. We have said that if you have got a plan in the private sector that you are happy with, you have got a doctor you are happy with, you keep that person. We are not going to be messing with that. What I have said is setting up a public option that would compete with the private sector, but, if it was offering a better product, would give a additional choice to consumers, that is going to keep insurance companies honest. Now, I understand why insurance companies would not want it, because if they are making huge profits and there is no competition, then why would not they want to keep that? I understand it, I am sympathetic. But I think the average American says to themselves, `Why is it that all these members of Congress, including all the Republican members of Congress, they have essentially a public option, they essentially have the ability to look at a menu of choices and exercise those choices; why should not ordinary Americans have that as well?' And I think that that kind of approach is sensible. But what I have also said is let us just make sure that, you know, we are open-minded. And if, for example, the cooperative idea that Kent Conrad has put forward, if that is a better way to reduce costs and help families and businesses with their health care, I am more than happy to accept those good ideas. A lot of concern about debt and deficits, as you know. Bond vigilantes people talk about, but the ordinary American people as well. That is your problem, whoever created it Yes. whether or not your health care plan adds a dime to the deficit. What can you say to reassure those people who are concerned about debt that after you have finished this round of legislating on health care that you are going to do something about that; and specifically, are you open to curbing benefits for entitlement programs, more means testing and raising the retirement age? Well, this is something that keeps me awake at night. There is no doubt that we have got a serious problem in terms of our long-term deficit and debt. I make no apologies for having acted short-term to deal with our recession. I think the vast majority of economists, conservative and liberal, felt that extraordinary interventions were necessary to prevent us from slipping into a potentially deep depression. But as soon as this economy recovers, and that means planning now and starting to take some steps now to deal with it, we are going to have to close that gap between the amount of money coming in and the money amount of money going out. I have said before and I will repeat, I believe that we can reform entitlements in a way that makes it more sustainable. But most experts will tell you that the biggest driver of those deficits is health care costs. And no matter what else I do, if health care is still going up 5, 6, 7, 8 percent a year, if it is going up three times faster than wages, then we are going to see a federal government that is broke. So how do we do that? I am open to Social Security and how we can make some tweaks to that. That is the easier challenge. I think when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, the biggest cost drivers are ones that we can reform if we look at how we are reimbursing doctors and hospitals, if we look at prevention and health IT, if we look at the concept of comparative effectiveness. Those communities that are doing a better job providing high-quality care at low cost, let us duplicate that across the system. It turns out those are in fact exactly the things that we are proposing in our health care reform plan. So if we get that done, then we have gone a long way towards solving this problem. If we do not , we are going to continue to have problems. Couple things, quickly, before we run out of time. You took your time reacting to the protests in Iran after the election. What are you watching for in the handling of those protests and in the investigation of the results to and how will that influence the dialogue that you seek to have with Iran? Well, I think first of all, it is important to understand that although there is amazing ferment taking place in Iran, that the difference between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi in terms of their actual policies may not be as great as has been advertised. Either way, we were going to be dealing with an Iranian regime that has historically been hostile to the United States, that has caused some problems in the neighborhood and is pursuing nuclear weapons. And so we have got long-term interests in having them not weaponize nuclear power and stop funding organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. And that would be true whoever came out on top in this election. The second thing that I think's important to recognize is that the easiest way for reactionary forces inside Iran to crush reformers is to say it is the US that is encouraging those reformers. So what I have said is, `Look, it is up to the Iranian people to make a decision. We are not meddling.' And, you know, ultimately the question that the leadership in Iran has to answer is their own credibility in the eyes of the Iranian people. And when you have got 100,000 people who are out on the streets peacefully protesting, and they are having to be scattered through violence and gunshots, what that tells me is the Iranian people are not convinced of the legitimacy of the election. And my hope is that the regime responds not with violence, but with a recognition that the universal principles of peaceful expression and democracy are ones that should be affirmed. Am I optimistic that that will happen? You know, I take a wait-and-see approach. Either way, it is important for the United States to engage in the tough diplomacy around those permanent security concerns that we have nuclear weapons, funding of terrorism. That is not going to go away, and I think it is important for us to make sure that we have reached out. Last question. When you and I spoke in January, you said I observed that you had not gotten much bad press. You said it is coming. Media critics would say not only has it not come, but that you have gotten such favorable press, either because of bias or because you are good box office, that it is hurting the country, because you are not being sufficiently held accountable for your policies. Assess that. It is very hard for me to swallow that one. First of all, I have got one television station entirely devoted to attacking my administration. I mean, you know, that is a pretty I assume you are talking about Fox. Well, that is a pretty big megaphone. And you'd be hard-pressed, if you watched the entire day, to find a positive story about me on that front. I think that, ultimately, my responsibility is to provide the best possible decision making on behalf of the American people at a time where we have got a lot of big problems. And, you know, we welcome people who are asking us some, you know, tough questions. And I think that I have been probably as accessible as any ENTITY in the first six months press conferences, taking questions from reporters, being held accountable, being transparent about what it is that we are trying to do. I think that, actually, the reason that people have been generally positive about what we have tried to do is they feel as if I am available and willing to answer questions, and we have not been trying to hide them all. I do think that, you know, we cannot be complacent, and that as long as we have got these tough problems in place that not only journalists, but the American people are going to keep on asking, you know, whether or not we are delivering. And they understand it is not going to take us just a few months to get out of the hole that we are in; but, you know, I suspect that as time goes on, with high unemployment, with the economy still slow, that, you know, people are going to be continuing to expect results. And I welcome that. That is why I took the job. ENTITY, thanks for making the time. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

{"id": 388, "text": "ENTITY, is not this going to be a terribly lonely house with both your daughters married and gone? Ray, I am sure there will be moments when I will walk into Lynda's room and stand quietly and look at k. And there will be those things in the mirror, you know--a snapshot, a sort of a yellowed newspaper story, a napkin with something from a party on it. And those Ernest Shephard drawings on the wall that she loved so well, you know, from the Winnie the Pooh books. Then I will have a sudden little wave of loneliness. But, no, not essentially. There will always be activity and excitement here. They will be coming back lots of times. Speaking of loneliness, the other day I walked through a room where there was a picture, a family picture of us, and I just stopped and looked at it. There were just the four of us. And I thought how poor. Now we are seven. Well, that does not make for loneliness. That just makes for more happiness when you can get together. ENTITY, how do you feel on that point? Very much the same. I was at the bachelors' dinner last night. They asked me to make a few observations. I told them that there were many pluses and minuses in life, as I was not unaware. I have had opportunity to be reminded on occasion of the minuses, but I am not sure that I ever stressed the great pluses for me. And they were my three girls--ENTITY, and Lynda, and Luci. The thing that gives me added strength is that I have increased that number of three that I look to for comfort and for strength and for help to six now. Of course, Patrick Lyndon has his own way of giving it to you. And I would not say it is effective on a mass basis yet. But Pat Nugent was there and Chuck Robb was there. And the increase of the family does give me increased satisfaction. : We, Of course, have seen them over the years, ENTITY and ENTITY, and have our own impressions. But I wonder if you could talk with us a bit about the differences in Lynda's personality and Luci's personality. There has been a lot written and said about it. I wonder if you could talk with us what you think the differences in their personalities are? Well, they are just as different as they can be. Luci is sort of the eternal Eve. She is extremely feminine. She is female before she is a person--dainty, oriented toward clothes and children and house. Lynda is, oh, she is so intelligent and so companionable. So--she has a questing mind and a great sense of excitement in facing life. She is my best companion for a lot of things that we do together--trips, going to plays, and going to art galleries. None of that makes the slightest bit of difference in the measure that you love them, you know. I had the best little insight on that last night, Dan, in their differences, when we had--Lyndon spoke of the party that he went to. Here, there was a very small one, just the bridesmaids. They did let the two mothers come down for awhile. And Luci wrote a poem about her life with her sister which ended with a delightful little line about as children and sisters and friends. And so they change with the years, you know, and they emerge as friends. And all of their differences are very, very apparent and make life a lot more exciting. : ENTITY, there are those who have said over the years that Luci was your favorite. Would you talk to us about the contrasting personalities of the girls? I think that I have never known many parents who had favorites among their own children. I think you see different things in different children. I think ENTITY has expressed it very well. They are quite different. Luci writes it and Lynda reads it. Lynda very much wants to--is a very curious person and wants to know all about everything that has been written that she has heard much about. She pursues it. She digests it. She assimilates and she retains it. She is a very good student and that has been emphasized in all of her work. Luci, on the other hand, is very gay and not concerned with being Phi Beta Kappa or leading the class or making the honor society, although her grades were quite good and we were pleased with them. But, Luci, instead of going to a book and enjoying a poem, would just save time by writing it. Luci, I expect, could prepare a pretty good cookbook and prepare a better meal. She has unique tastes. I like to think that Luci is like my mother and my mother was one of my favorites, one of my very special favorites. The only one I ever had to compare with her is the one that Lynda is like. That is Lynda's mother. They are quite two different people. One is a blonde. One is a brunette . Both of them were good students. One of them was pretty conservative and prudent and careful and business conscious. After all, ENTITY is the only one in our family that has ever met a payroll, you know. Mother was creative, literary, producer of plays, and producer of poems, and producer of articles, and things of that nature, and not much concerned about who was going to buy the paper or pay for the--or meet the payroll or any of the things you really have to know. The best thing of all is that they just put their own talents, combine them, into making the family, into giving to the family. I see in Lynda her mother every time she writes a check. I see in Luci her grandmother every time she cannot find her checkbook and does not know what her balance is. ENTITY, you once told us you were very proud of Captain Robb because he did not presume to speak for you when reporters asked him what you said when he asked you for Lynda's hand. What do you think of this young man who is about to marry your daughter? I like him very much. I read his press conference the other day and I am going to try to emulate it. I hope that I do not have to stay under fire for over an hour as he did. I want to keep ours to 30 minutes. But I think that he is a young man of unusual experience and he has made the most of it. You once indicated to us, sir, right after the engagement was announced that it was primarily Lynda's decision and not one to be made by you. Oh, of course, all of their romances have been their decisions. Luci and Lynda have had friends throughout the years--some closer than others; some they were more interested in than others. But all the people they have brought in the house we have been interested in and we have tried to enjoy them and make them a part of the family--and, generally speaking, they have been. I am quite optimistic about this generation. I have liked what I have seen and what has come here and what has gone from here, and what is--and all of them that fill the rooms here today, the bridesmaids and their escorts and so forth. I had to give up tutoring Luci in about the 10th grade, because she had already passed me. I am pretty high on this generation. I think that Captain Robb and Pat Nugent are two very unusual boys. And I think we are very fortunate to have them. And as near as I can see, with the many, many temptations that they have had, the embarrassments that have come from their conduct are unknown to me. ENTITY, how does it affect a Commander in Chief, so to speak, to know that his new son-in-law is going off to a war? Well, I guess you are glad that you have a son-in-law who has had the training, several years in an elite group like the Marines, who is prepared and equipped to look after his country's interests. I feel that way about all the Marine Corps and the boys in the other services, too. I am grateful for them. They are a mighty fine group of people that I think we do not really appreciate enough. It is pretty hard to appreciate a man enough who is willing to give his life for your liberty. Chuck Robb came out of the University of Wisconsin and by choice went in the Marines and has led them ever since. And I will not have any doubt about the group that he follows out there or the group that he leads. I believe that it will be well done. : ENTITY, I know that you and Lynda must have had long conversations just before the wedding. What pieces of advice did you give her? ENTITY, I would be interested to know what pieces of advice you had for her. I would not really quite presume to advise her. You just live your life, you know. And then--you spend 23 years trying not to give advice but help show and direct and train. And then it is --well, every now and then you get a nice bonus of satisfaction when you find out that they are reacting in the way that you hope they will--the wisest and right. : You have not found that actually stating advice has been very effective or a good way to raise the girls? Not as orders. What I have learned from life and what I think is the wisest course, yes. Sometimes you just have to flatly state the difference between right and wrong and say this is what you ought to do. But, oh, I do not think you can sit down and give a pattern for a young girl of 23 who has already acquired her system of values and her beliefs about life and behavior. ENTITY, if you could give these two young people anything at all, what would it be? Well, that is very difficult for me to say. I, of course, want them, more than anything else, to have a grasp and understanding of other people. You are concerned from the time you get up until you go to sleep at night with human relationships. Over the years I have tried to do that. I think that they have had unusual opportunities in that respect. Both of them have been on the platform since they were little tots. 1964, I remember Luci waking me up at 3 o'clock one night and I was rather irritated that a boy would be bringing her in that late. It was 3 o'clock Monday morning, as a matter of fact. She and I were in the home together. I got up and asked her to give an accounting why she was coming in so late. She said, Well, daddy, I have been to North Dakota and South Dakota and Nebraska this weekend. And I made 11 speeches and we are in trouble in Nebraska. That was why she was late coming in. I think that I would want them to do unto others as they would have them do unto them and that they would always try to put themselves in the other fellow's position and say, I just want to exchange positions with you and see how I would feel about that reaction. If they do that on everything from the minor to the major decisions, I believe they would have a better state of mind. I believe they would be more successful. I think they would be more satisfied with themselves. I think they would contribute more to their country. I think it is more valuable to them to understand human beings and try to engage in that objective that is primary with all of us---bettering humanity. I think that is the best way to better humanity--to understand humanity. The best way to understand humanity is to put yourself in the other fellow's position and say, If I were in his place, how would I feel about the reaction I am giving him? Am I treating him like I would like to be treated? ENTITY and I have tried, in our relationship with each other, to bear that in mind. I felt it so strongly that many years ago, for a Christmas present, I gave my wife and my daughters a little watch that had the Golden Rule on it. Sometimes, particularly when the press shoves me too far, I have to look at that watch and be reminded of that and count 10 before I respond. But I think that is about as valuable a thing as a person can have--understanding his fellow man and trying to devote his life to bettering him. ENTITY, does one ever really become accustomed to raising daughters in a goldfish bowl? I cannot say that I have found it too difficult. There are so many counter-balancing things--so many opportunities, interesting, exciting, significant people; a sense that you are on the front row of a great drama that is unfolding and that you have an opportunity to contribute a little bitty bit to it-oh, I could not say it has been bad. It has had some annoying moments. But not much. And in line with what Lyndon was saying a few minutes ago about understanding, one of the best things that ever happened to me was the opportunity when he was off in the war to work for 6 months in his office. I do not think I ever got quite as annoyed at him afterwards for being late for dinner or being sometimes exasperated. I hope my children can somehow acquire that same sort of understanding. It helps. ENTITY, how much of a problem has this been for you raising Lynda in the bright light of publicity? It has its very great advantages to me and to the children--as well as its minuses--the contacts with knowledgeable people, the interests of members of the Cabinet in young high school or college girls. I have seen Dean Rusk and Bob McNamara and Secretaries Fowler and Wirtz and others sit around here and talk over governmental questions with Luci and Lynda while The children do not seem to know there is a gap in age and importance. They just sit and listen and sometimes speak up a bit. This happened when I was talking to another Cabinet member about something quite private. I think it has broadened their horizons and given them different viewpoints--better understanding-and taken away some of the shyness and some of the hesitancies that would go with girls of that age. On the other hand, I have seen very cruel things happen to them because of their father's position or because of their connection with the White House. I have bristled a good many times. I have not written any letters yet, but I have bristled and choked myself. George Christian has had to pat me even last night on one little item where Lynda-something is attributed to her that she had no connection with at all--never heard of-a credibility problem. She cannot get it back though. I think that is true of all parents. Something that is unjust and hurts their child hurts them even more. My father used to say to me that you will never know what it is to be a father until you are one. He also said to me, when he would spank me as a youngster, Lyndon, this hurts me worse than it does you. I never did quite believe that. I wondered if he really knew how much it was hurting me and how could it hurt him that much. But I can see now when they are pulled in unjustly, charged with this or that, and it is untrue, no basis for it, just clear out of the air sometimes, when some person, political or otherwise, will say this, it hurts me very much. So those are the disadvantages. You can just think what would happen to Luci if she had a paper cup of beer. You can think about what would happen if Lynda went through an orange light and her brake did not hold. It is front page. It is special shows. And it is dramatized. Maybe she is ostracized. But those, in the whole general picture, are very minor and unimportant compared to the advantages to them of the associations and the responsibilities they have, as well as their contribution to the success of their father's program. I do not know anyone who has done more to help me try to better humanity than my wife and my two daughters. Luci, I believe, was in 26 States, Lynda was approximately the same number--24 or 25. They made four or five speeches a day on their own, without any ghost writers, standing up on the platform of a train or on a box or at a picnic or out with the youngsters on a college campus. And the fact that you have not read any too terrible things about them--some of the boys that have suffered unjustly, I think, because their name became associated with one or the other of them at times. The kids started hurrahing them and they got into columns. That speculation started and that exaggeration came. But if I had it all to do over, I doubt that they could have a more satisfying experience than to be the children of public servants. I doubt that they could be more broad-gauged or learn more about what it is all about in life than to have had a little experience in the Congress and in the Senate and the Vice Presidency and the Presidency. After all, men like Dean Rusk and Bob McNamara and Sam Rayburn, and Abe Fortas and Clark Clifford and folks like that are pretty good to have around with your girls and to teach them. : ENTITY, you mentioned that your father did not spare the rod with you, that he did spank you. Were you pretty heavy with the hairbrush with the girls? Well, boys are more difficult than are girls now. He was probably a difficult boy in his time. Oh, I was an outlaw compared to these dainty little girls. We have never had any problem like that with them. I think they are so good because I have had very little to do with raising them. Their mother is the one that has brought them up. The first few years with Lynda I did have to--I assumed the authority and did discipline her on occasion very much to her mother's dissatisfaction and to Lynda's. On one occasion, I was trying to settle something that needed to be decided, and from my viewpoint, quickly with the Speaker or with someone else who might be having dinner with me. And Lynda was determined that she should be the center of attraction. The Speaker would be glad to have that happen because he did not want it decided anyway. I had to take Lynda upstairs a time or two with my hand, a kind of on the back end, and she would-- But by the time Luci came along, she gave Lynda all the tricks and the things not to do and we have not had any problems since then. : How did you handle discipline with the girls, ENTITY? It is always difficult, I think, more difficult to discipline girls than it is boys. How did you handle the discipline problem? I do not think so at all. I really do not have any experience with boys. But I have not found it difficult with the girls. : Well, how did you handle discipline when they did not do something that you thought they should do? Particularly as they got older. What kind of discipline did you impose on them? I just talked to them, Dan, and told them what I thought were the two sides of it. The answer is she did not apply any, Dan. She would just say, Always remember you are trusted, always remember you are loved, always remember we care and I know that you are going to do what is right. They have not had any hours. They have not had any limitations. They have not had any things that--you cannot smoke, you must not drink, you cannot do any of these things. We do not have them. It really got across, though, the idea about hours. However we did it. They learned about not staying out too late. ENTITY, with all these preparations going on right now-you recently observed an anniversary. Do you think back to your own wedding? Yes. Quite a bit different, was it? Very simple. ENTITY, we are told mothers have an intuition about these things. Did you know, did you sense when Lynda first brought Captain Robb around that he was the one after all of her other boyfriends? Ray, I think the tip-off is when Lynda Bird began to say--about the second time that she said, Mother, I want you to know Chuck better. When she begins to say--to plan that we sit down and talk, I began to sense then that this had some deeper implications, and so I was eager to do it. And I liked it. I like knowing their friends. That has been one of the good things about our life. They have brought them home, lots of them. I do not know when I have enjoyed an evening more than I did last night when I sat with some oh, 75 or 100 boys. Young men, some just back from Vietnam sat at the table with us, some just going to Vietnam, some professional men, some young teachers, doctors in the 25 to 30 age group. Some singing, and toasting and performing with jokes and things of that kind. Then I went around and met with each of them and--it was quite an exhilarating experience. I wish they were not so concealed and hidden from the American people. I wish that all America could see them en masse, just what the parents of this country have done and the kind of young man that we are producing. And I think it would make us all feel good. You do not worry about the younger generation then, ENTITY, do you? Oh, yes, all the time. I worry about their opportunities and how they can keep their eyes on the stars and plenty of adventure and vision, how we can be on the same wavelength and still keep their feet on the ground and be realistic. The great quality of youth is its hope and its dream and its vision. We must capture all of that without--and still keep a little realism in it and make it possible. I have heard, through my 37 years here, I have heard many doubters talk about these boys-- How in the world could they ever bring Hitler to his knees, these 17-year old, fuzzy-faced kids that have never been away from home? I have seen men get up on the floor of the Congress and talk about how we were going to the dogs. I heard that for 30 years here. But then I saw those same kids in their B-17's go across both oceans, carry Old Glory around the world and bring her back without a stain on it. And it showed me then that you do not want to be too quick to judge all youth by the few exhibitionists. They are definitely in the minority. I saw that in World War II. I saw it in Korea. I think it is greatly emphasized now because of television. We see a few people and we think that this represents the young manhood and young womanhood of the country. It does not . It just represents the dramatic. And sometimes, we help them make it dramatic. I read the other day where some television company brought in the signs. The youth did not have them so they brought some of their own along, to use in case they could get pictures of the picketing. Now, maybe that college had 20,000 people and perhaps a scene of that kind will involve 20 or 200. Now, we have had that all through our life from the Revolutionary period on down. They are young people. There are some of them--we do not see everything alike or we would all want the same things. But we are seeing more of the same every day in small groups here. I saw a different group last night. No picket signs? I saw men who loved their liberty and their freedom and who were actually dedicating their all to trying to preserve it and really believed very deeply in what they were doing. That is not to say that those who disagree with them are not equally as sincere. But I was very proud of these men who are willing to assume the responsibilities they are. I think if you look at the boy in 1968 and look at his father in 1928, you will see that the curve has been going upward in intelligence, in understanding, in better bodies, in better minds, in better education, in better--more material things available to them, and better living. I am glad to see it, and I think that the next 20 years it will continue to go up. Now there are some who think it is going to the bad. But I am not one of them. Thank you, ENTITY. Thank you, ENTITY.

{"id": 510, "text": "ENTITY, are you there? I am, ENTITY. Good morning to you. We think that a lot of people responded to a theme, or at least I think so, in the presidential campaign of sacrifice to cut the deficit as long as that sacrifice is equal. The Btu tax was designed originally on the concept of equal sacrifice. But then all of these exceptions were added, and it really makes it appear that it is one of the most complicated proposals ever. Did you make a mistake allowing all the special exceptions to be included in the Btu tax? Well, I did not allow them all to be included. Some of them were included in the House of Representatives bill, and I did not agree with all of them. But let me say what I think was a good criticism of the tax and that is that we wanted the tax to restrain energy consumption in ways that promoted energy conservation and also supported fuel switching to more environmentally beneficial and more available natural gas. That bill, as drawn, would be a big boon to the natural gas industry in Texas and Oklahoma and throughout the United States. And that is one of the things we were trying to do. Now, some of the oil companies did not like it, but the people that were in the gas business liked it. We had a big Texas gas company, headed by a person who strongly supported President Bush in the last election, endorsed the economic program. ARCO and Sun Oil both endorsed the economic program, including the Btu tax. So Secretary Bentsen, who, as you know, has represented you in the Senate for a long time, offered the Senate a modified Btu tax which, instead of having all those particular exemptions, would basically have alleviated the burden of the Btu tax on industry and agriculture on the production sector but still given them an incentive to move toward natural gas wherever possible and would also have cut the Btu rate and would have replaced that with more spending cuts. From my point of view, unfortunately, we could not pass that through the committee because Senator Boren had said he would not vote for any tax based on the heat content of fuel. But I still think it was a good concept, and it will be interesting to see what happens if the Senate's version of the economic plan passes, to see what happens in the conference and what we come up with. What we have now is a gasoline tax that is been passed by the Senate committee, and you have called that regressive in the past. How can you sell that, if you have to, to House Members who did risk some political capital by supporting you on the Btu tax? I think anything that comes out has to be a combination of agreement between the House and the Senate. It is hard to get 218 House Members and 51 Senators to agree on anything that is tough. I mean, everybody can talk about cutting the deficit, but it is one thing to talk about it and quite another to do. But I think they will be able to do it. No one was particularly happy with the form of the Btu tax, or very few people were, that passed the House, but everybody thought that Secretary Bentsen could come up with a plan that would make it good for the economy and could achieve what we were trying to do in terms of promoting domestic energy, and I think he did. The Senate preferred a tax that was a gas tax and a tax on some other fuels. It, at least, is small enough so that it is not particularly unfair to people in rural areas. It is not as big as what some had wanted, and certainly I did not want just a big old gas tax. I thought that was unfair. I also think it is important to point out in Texas, in light of the rhetoric in the recent political campaign, that it is simply not true that there is no spending cuts in this plan. There is $250 billion in spending cuts, and they affect everything. They affect agriculture and veterans and Medicare and the whole range of discretionary spending of the Government. They affect foreign aid; they affect defense. There are sweeping, broad-based spending cuts in this program. And the tax increases, two-thirds of them, fall on people with incomes above $200,000, three-quarters on people with incomes above $100,000. Families of four with incomes below $30,000 are held harmless, and people who work for a living 40 hours a week and have kids in the house who are now in poverty would actually be lifted above poverty by these tax changes in ways that promote the movement from welfare to work. So this is a fair and balanced plan. It was developed, and in a very aggressive way, by Lloyd Bentsen and by Leon Panetta, who used to be chairman of the House Budget Committee, to be fair, to have equal spending cuts in taxes, and to drive the deficit down so we could bring interest rates down. That is good for Texas, and that is good for everybody in America. And also, it leaves some room for investments that are critical to our future. And as you know, I support you were implying this before I got on I support the space station and the super collider projects because I think they are good for America's future. And if you are going to spend money on those things, you have to spend money on them. You cannot play games; they do cost some money. ENTITY, how long can you guarantee that support for the super collider and the space station? Will they fall if that is the only way to meet your overall deficit reduction goal? Well, my overall deficit reduction goals can be met in my plan with the space station and the super collider. I do want to emphasize that we have already shaved $4 billion off the 5-year budget for the space station and some money off the 5-year budget for the super collider by redesigning the space station, based on a team of exceptional national experts who analyzed the project and recommended that it be redesigned and also that NASA's management be changed rather dramatically. And we just delayed the implementation schedule on the super collider some, so that none of the opponents of the space station and the super collider could claim that there had been no spending cut there. So we have done that. But I strongly feel it would be a mistake to abandon those. Now, I would be less than candid if I did not tell you that there are a lot of people in other parts of the country who want to cut those projects. There was always a lot of opposition to them, and because of the last election and all of the rhetoric and all the claims in Texas that there were no spending cuts in this budget, that has given real energy to the opponents of the space station and the super collider. It was not true that there were no spending cuts, but there are a lot of people up there who have been wanting to kill these projects for years who are just gleeful at the way the rhetoric in the last election played out in Texas. They think that they have been given a license by the people of Texas to kill the space station and the super collider. And it is going to be very much harder for me to keep them alive. But I am doing the best I can. ENTITY, I am informed that our time has run out, by one of your aides, I believe. Good to talk with you this morning. Thank you. I enjoyed it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithphiladlerkrldradiodallastexas", "title": "Interview With Phil Adler of KRLD Radio, Dallas, Texas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-phil-adler-krld-radio-dallas-texas", "publication_date": "21-06-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 361, "text": "ENTITY, minors buy one billion packs of cigarettes a year. How are you going to make not smoking and quitting smoking cool and attractive to young people? Well, I think we have to do several things. I think, first of all, the Government's responsibility is to make sure that the young people understand that it is addictive and dangerous and can kill them and that about one-third of the young people who start smoking every day-about 1,000 people a day, young people, start smoking who will have their lives shortened because of it. The second thing I think you have to do is make it less accessible. Then the third thing we have to do is make it less attractive, that is, we need to change the advertising and limit the ability of advertising to be a lure. We had a young teenager in here who was part of an antismoking group yesterday who said to me-I was so touched-she said, We look at these TV ads, she said, these girls smoking, they are always tall; they are always thin; they always have long hair; they are always pretty. She said, It is just like when the boys who are young see a movie star holding a gun. And it was shocking what she said. And then what we want the tobacco companies to do is to spend some money on an affirmative strategy to put out positive messages-over MTV, for example-about how it is cool not to smoke instead of to smoke. So I think you make it less accessible, less attractive, and then put out a positive message. And of course, we need a lot of help. We need people like you to do programs like this, and every parent in this country needs to talk to their children-all the parents need to talk to their children about it, because we now have done 14 months careful research and we know how damaging this is, and we know that the tobacco companies know how damaging it is from their own files. We have got to do something about it. Do you worry about making smoking more enticing by making it more forbidden to young people? I think that is always a concern; there could be some of that. But the staggering magnitude of the damage that it is doing is so great, I think if young people really understand how dangerous it really is and all the things that can happen to them and how it can affect their future, I do not think it will be more glamorous. You know, though, what kids are going to say. In a time where they are growing up and sex is associated with AIDS, alcohol with drunk driving, going out late at night you could be shot, it is very violent, smoking during your adolescence almost seems like a lesser evil. I know it does, but in some ways it is the thing that puts the most at risk over the long run. And we have to do something about the other things, too. I have fought very hard to get the assault weapons out of the hands of gang members, to pass the Brady bill, to put more police officers on the street. The crime rate is going down in almost every-almost every big city in this country, the crime rate is going down. We have to-we are doing a better job trying to keep big shipments of drugs out of the country. We are working hard on that. But this is a serious problem. On alcohol, it is less accessible than cigarettes. It is still a problem, but I want a zero tolerance drunk driving law for young people in every State in the country or here in the Congress. But the cigarettes-the magnitude of the damage caused is greater than all of that right now. And we just have to focus on it. I know it-because there normally is a period of several years between the time you start and keep smoking and the time you face the consequences, and when you are young you think you are going to live forever, I know that it is going to be harder to get young people to focus on that. But we have to. There is a lot of destructive behavior in America we need to attack at the same time, and I just think that we can get these numbers way, way down. You gave the number-a billion packs of cigarettes or a billion cigarettes a year-we can get that way down. And when we do, we will get the life expectancy of these young people and their quality of life way up. Did you ever experiment with cigarettes as a teen? Did you go through that phase? I did not . But I am surprised I did not , but I did not . The reason I did not is because my mother was a heavy smoker. She smoked a couple of packs of cigarettes a day until my daughter got her to quit for her 8th birthday. When my daughter turned 8, her grandmother gave her that for a present. So I had a bad feeling about it from childhood. But it was only because of that. I am sure I would have done it otherwise. Why were you savvy enough to have a bad feeling about it? You did not like the smell of the house, or you did not like-- Yes, I did not like the smell in the house. And I thought it was-it struck me as a bad habit, kind of a nervous habit, a reliance. And I had a feeling that it was not good for her health. What would you say to Chelsea if you saw her fall under peer pressure of some of her friends and start smoking or if you found ashes in her bedroom in an ashtray or something? I would talk to her about it and tell her I thought it was a bad idea. She is the most militant person in our house, though. Yes, it does not sound like you are worried. She and Hillary are always on me. You know, as I confessed yesterday, I still, once in a great while, maybe five, six, seven times a year, will smoke a cigar when I am outside. They think that is awful-at all. And I have got to do better with it. But if they see me chewing one on the golf course or something, they are on me. So my family is doing a better job with it than I am. Some kids I talk to said that nothing but an outright ban on cigarettes would deter them. So why not a ban? Because cigarettes are just as deadly, if not more so, for adults. They are, but they are not illegal. You have to go through all the same problems we went through with prohibition with liquor. It would have significant economic dislocations for a large number of Americans. And I think as a practical matter, because so many adults are, in effect, hooked on it, it would be very, very difficult to enforce. What I want to do is to phase it out over time by getting-if young people stop using cigarettes-if we could get young people, the usage down to zero, then eventually it will phase out. That would be my goal. I think we just have to start with our young people. Do you consider tobacco companies evil? I would not go that far. I do not think that. And I certainly do not consider the tobacco farmers evil. I think they are good people. Most of them-a lot of them come from families that have been doing it 100, sometimes 200 years. I think some of these companies have known for a long time, according to their own documents, that nicotine was both addictive and destructive. And they have-insofar as they have pretended that they did not know that, that is wrong. I think some of these companies have said, we do not want teenagers to smoke, but they have consciously directed their advertising strategies to make it appealing to young people and not just Joe Camel, which was obvious, but a lot of other things as well. I think those things are wrong. And what I want the tobacco companies to do is stop doing the wrong thing and start doing the right thing. I think they ought to come in here and support this-these restrictions. I think they ought to ask Congress to enact them into law now. If they do not want the FDA to regulate them, let us enact the law now. And I think that we ought to start the very next day on this campaign together. If the tobacco companies really do not want kids to smoke, we can do this together. Are you going to try to bring back the cigarette tax? California has had a lot of success with that in their State. Well, this Congress would not adopt that. I have had a number of people who've come from tobacco countries suggest that some of the cigarette tax ought to be devoted to helping the farmers who want to convert their farmland to other purposes, to some sort of buy-out program. But I think that right now what we ought to do is-the bulk of the cigarette tax is available to the States, and a lot of the States now are passing cigarette taxes to help to pay for the health care bills of people who are suffering from tobacco-related illnesses. And I do not want to see the Congress and the Federal Government crowd that out. So when I proposed a tobacco tax before, it was to pay for health care. That is not going to happen this year. Right now, advertising is written off as a business expense, and that means the public pays in some fashion for all advertising, including cigarette advertising. Would you consider getting rid of the tax deduction for cigarette advertising? You are the first person who is ever suggested it to me. I'd never though of that. That is an interesting idea. So I will give you a few minutes to absorb it, and I will come back. That is an interesting idea. I have never thought of that. Because I think a lot of people would be offended by the idea of paying for an unhealthy product to advertise and garner more smokers through it. But I will let you dwell on it. Not only do you want to regulate tobacco products, but you are also in favor of regulating how they are marketed. And I was wondering, how far do you plan to go? When a musician sits down to talk with me and they are smoking a cigarette, should I not air that footage on MTV? Should I ask Keith Richards to put out his cigarette before he does an interview with me? Should this go for all television? Because of lot of young people watch MTV. I think that is a decision for you to make. I think you should ask him to put it out because I think there are a lot of young people-- It is Keith Richards. I know. And I know he is an icon-for me, too. I do not know if he-his heart might stop if he does not have a cigarette. That is the great thing about their endurance, you know. But that is a decision that each network, each interviewer, they will have to make. Let me just say this: I believe very strongly in the first amendment and the right to free speech, free association, and freedom of religion. I believe in a very broad interpretation of it. But I believe that we should be restricting advertising directed at children because it is illegal to sell cigarettes to children. So, therefore, if it is illegal to sell cigarettes to children, it cannot be illegal to stop the advertising directed at children. So that is what my focus is. In terms of the interviews and everything, I would hope every American adult, even those who smoke, would think, as I had to when I became ENTITY and I had this occasional bad habit of having my cigar once in a while, I would hope they would think about not doing it in public, not doing it around children, not setting a bad example. I think we adults have a responsibility to try to set a good standard for our young people and to basically say everybody's got a lot of problems, but being self-destructive is not a way to deal with them. ENTITY, I want to say this as politely as I can, but I think a lot of our viewers are going to be wondering why should they listen to you about this issue? Well, they do not have to listen to me about this issue. What we are going to do is change the law. But I will tell you why they should listen to me or to anybody else. I would say that if they wanted to listen to me, do not listen to me, look at the medical research, look at the evidence. This is about their lives, not mine. I have lived most of my life. Their lives are ahead of them. And the reason they should listen to me is that the evidence is on my side, not just because I am ENTITY. We know that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is addictive, is destructive, and will shorten the lives of one out of three people who start smoking on a regular basis. We know that. So what they should do is say, Okay, here is the evidence; now, what kind of life do I want to live? Ultimately, it is going to be their decision, because even if the law keeps cigarettes away from them in the near-term, soon they will turn 18, and they will be able to do whatever they want to do. They have to make these decisions. But I think-my job, what I am trying to do here every day and with the economy, with saving the college loan program, with trying to preserve the environment from this awful assault that the Congress is making on it, is to give the young people of our country a good country to grow up into and a good life to look forward to. Then they have to make a decision about how to live that life. And what those of us who are older are supposed to do is to say here is what we think will maximize your choices. Here is what we think will give you the chance to live up to the fullest of your abilities. And that is what I hope they will listen to, because the evidence is on my side. I am not just preaching here, I have all this evidence. Right. Right. It is not like you do not have enough things to do already. But this is a big deal. Look, look. Everything I try to do here, if you look at-let us just take trying to save the college loan program from attack and trying to preserve the environmental protections we have in this country. Why would I do that? Because I want my child and our grandchildren and all the young people coming up to enjoy a good life. That still requires all these individuals who are watching us to make decisions about how they are going to live. And being addicted to tobacco is not a smart thing to do if you want to have a long, full, good life. It is a huge roll of the dice. I never will forget a few years ago having to speak at the funeral of a very close friend of mine, a man that had literally no other vices. He was one of the most perfect human beings I ever knew. But he smoked a couple of packs of cigarettes a day, and he died of lung cancer 2 1/2 years after he had his last cigarette because it takes that long to clean out your lungs. Wow. And he was younger than me. I never got over it. I never will get over it. While I have you, there are a couple of other issues I wanted to ask you about that are important to young voters, in addition to smoking and their health, which you sort of rattled off very quickly. First, though, the woman best known as Jane Roe, whose struggle to obtain an abortion led to the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, has come out against anything but first trimester abortions. How big a blow do you feel this is to the pro-choice movement? Well, as I understand it, she is gone through a number of changes in her life and had a serious religious conversion and believes that abortion is wrong now. The rule of Roe v. Wade is it permits everybody in America to make that same decision. That is, I think there are too many abortions in America. I have always believed that abortion should be rare but that they should be safe and legal until the third trimester when the child can live outside the mother's womb. If somebody has not made the decision by then, unless the life of the mother's in danger, I think they should be illegal, and they were in my State. But I think that leaving the decision to the woman and her doctor and whoever else she wishes to consult, I think on balance is still the right decision in our country. And that makes it possible for people like this woman to make up her own mind and to have her own convictions and then try to persuade other people that she is right. It leaves her free to say, My religious conviction is what is right for all of you; I hope you will follow me. People can do that. And we have a very vibrant, as you know, pro-life movement in this country of people trying to convince other people of that all the time. But we do not say to people who disagree that we are going to criminalize your conduct until the child can live outside the mother's womb. And I think, on balance, that is the right position for our country, and I would stick with it. Since abortion is under such attack in Congress, do you think that you should be doing more to support the pro-choice movement? Well, I do not know what else I can do. I am doing-I think I am doing everything I can. I certainly have made it absolutely clear where I stand. I have resisted the attempts in the Congress to take away the rights of choice to women in the service, to women who work for the Federal Government. There is a wholesale assault on the right to choose going on in the Congress now in all kinds of little, indirect ways. And I hope we can beat it back because I think it is -I do not think that is the right thing to do. I do not think the law here is the way to resolve all these problems. You have used executive actions in the first 2 years of your Presidency for issues like abortion. And in recent months, with the Republican majority, you have turned to them more frequently, the regulation of teenage smoking being the most recent one. Do you feel like you are subverting the will of Congress by tackling issues this way? No. I think that I probably should have been doing more of this all along. But in the first 2 years, I had to pour all of my energies into trying to do something to bring the deficit down, to invest more in education, to try to expand trade, and get the economy going again. And we were able to do that, but the voters still gave the Congress to the Republicans. And now it frees me up, in a way, to-most of my efforts, to try to keep them from undoing the gains we have made from wrecking an economic strategy or wrecking the education program or wrecking the environment. But I can now do things like use my executive authority, for example, to promote welfare reform in all 50 States, to do the other things that we talked about. So I think I probably should have been doing more of it all along. Today lawyers for the legal defense fund are announcing how much money they have raised. Does that make you feel awkward to have them up there saying, We have collected this money for the ENTITY to defend him? No. I mean, it is a little-I wish it were not necessary. But I am not a wealthy person and my adversaries decided that they would try to embroil me in all kinds of legal things, and I cannot afford to take any time off to think about it. So they are dealing with it the best they can in a legal and appropriate way. And I did not want to go to a few wealthy people and ask them to spend a ton of money to pay all my legal bills. So we resolved that the most appropriate thing to do would be to raise funds in a legal defense fund that had the same financial restrictions that running for Federal office does. And so that is what we have tried to do. Senator Dole and Senator Helms have proposed asking for $100 million in arms aid for Bosnia. Do you support this legislation? Not now because the arms embargo is on. My position is that the United States should not, by ourselves, violate the U.N. rule against selling arms into Bosnia because it applies to all Yugoslavia, that instead, what we ought to do is have that U.N. mission there work to stop aggression against Bosnia by letting NATO use its air power and by strengthening the U.N. mission on the ground. What happened in Srebrenica was awful. But it happened in large measure because the United Nations would not permit the United States and the other NATO allies to take strong action from the air against the Serbs. Now that there is been a real change on the ground and the Serbs have been rolled back in the western part of Bosnia and in Croatia by the Croats, I hope we have a chance to make a decent peace there. I would not be against-if the U.N. mission fails, I would be for selling arms to the Bosnians or making it possible for the Bosnians to buy arms, but only when we get everybody to lift the arms embargo at the U.N. But let me just say this in closing. We have an embargo against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and you see what happened. We put a lot of pressure on it; we now have some defectors coming over, weakening his power. If we say, We are going to ignore you, and we are going to sell arms to the Bosnians, then what is to prevent other countries from saying, Okay, we will ignore the U.N. embargo in Iraq, and we will bolster Saddam Hussein? I just have two more quick questions. Do you think it is a good thing that Time-Warner wants to sell Interscope Records? Do you know anything about that? No. I wanted to ask you if you were-well, Jerry Garcia has affected millions of Americans. Me, too. Were you a fan? Have you ever been to a Grateful Dead show? And why do you think he affected so many people of different backgrounds and generations? Well, first of all, he was just a great talent. I mean, he was really-he was a genius. And I was really pleased to see the Grateful Dead have one more great run around the country, you know, in the last couple of years and see all these young teenagers gravitating to a group that all of us liked 20 or more years ago. He had a great gift. And he even wound up putting out that line of ties. He had great ties. I would go around wearing Jerry Garcia ties and giving them away to people. So I was very sad when he died. But he also had a terrible problem that was a legacy of the life he lived and the demons he dealt with. And I would hope that all of us who loved his music and valued his contributions would also reflect on the consequences of, again, really self-destructive behavior. I mean, the lesson of Jerry Garcia's life is that he made a great contribution and he really was a-he had at least two generations of Deadheads, you know. Is Chelsea a fan at all? Has she ever gone to a show? Yes, very much. But she and I were talking-we had a long talk about it the other day, right before I left to come to the office. She called me on the phone. She is out of town, and she called me on the phone, and we were talking about it. And she was talking about all the kids in her school who are great fans of Jerry Garcia, and we had a long talk about it. But I would hope that as we mourn him and sort of feel grateful for what he did, we also-young people should say, I am not going to die that way. I am not going to die in a clinic with a drug addiction. I am not going to do it. You do not have to have a destructive lifestyle to be a genius and make a contribution. You do not have to do that. Any thoughts on the advertising, cigarette advertising being a tax deduction? I will look into it. It is an interesting idea. Nobody ever even raised it to me before. Maybe you should be here making public policy. That is great. I do not think so. I think I am quite busy. I would not want your job.

{"id": 97, "text": "When it comes to pacific trade this seems like this is fourth quarter, full court press, from you and your administration. It is the right thing to do for the American economy and the American people, and certainly the right thing to do for Seattle and the state of Washington. You know, since I have came into office, we have had very significant recovery and about a third of that has been driven by exports. We know that not only does it create billions of dollars in business and you know, millions of jobs depend on it, but what also is true is that typically wages for folks who work for exporting companies are about 18 percent higher than companies just focusing on the domestic market. So what we are arguing here is that globalization is here to stay, we have got to do everything we can to make sure that we are accessing other markets the same way that they are accessing ours, and that there is a level playing field on issues like labor standards and environmental standards. And that is what is reflected in this trade deal. Let me address that last issue. When Secretary Kerry was in Seattle area a couple weeks ago, some of the Boeing workers protested and some said they are worried about a trade deal that would adversely affect them, fearing that Boeing would build more plane parts outside of the United States, thus costing American jobs. What assurances can you give that worker from Boeing and any other big manufacturing plant that their job will be assured and stay put? Well let me just say this, other than maybe the CEO of Boeing, I do not know anyone who is done more to sell Boeing planes around the world than me and this administration. We have been very active in promoting some of our outstanding manufacturers and Boeing obviously is an iconic company. And what we know is is that when we have access to these markets then we are going to be able to compete and we also know that the U.S. has the best workers in the world, the best innovation in the world. And if Boeing was looking to relocate facilities than they would have already done so because under existing rules there is not much preventing them from doing so. Nothing in this agreement is going to induce other companies to move jobs, in fact it what it may do is bring some jobs back. I was at Nike, which like a lot of footwear companies, manufactures overseas. And what they said is look if this passes, we may bring ten thousand jobs back here to the United States because a lot of the production's moving into the high end production as opposed to low end, and we have more skilled workers here in the United States than we do in some of these other places. So you see no dislocation other than that would benefit the United States and American workers? You know, in an economy of this size, there is always going to be some dislocations. But, this is not the same circumstances we were in let us say 30, 20 years ago. Companies that are reliant on a model of just low wage workers, they have already left. And what we are seeing, cause manufacturing has actually grown faster under my administration than any time since the 1990s. And it is grown faster than any other sector of the economy. What we are finding is is that companies want to move here because of low energy cost, high worker skills, access to the biggest market in the world. What they worry about is are they also going to be able to sell from the United States to other countries and if we can pry those markets open, we are going to be that much better off. So this is not NAFTA? Well it is not NAFTA partly because we have-one of the big problems with NAFTA is we did not have strong labor and environmental standards that were enforceable in the agreement. And we have corrected that. And in fact, the two countries that were involved in NAFTA, Canada and Mexico, has signatories that if they end up agreeing to this Trans-pacific Partnership, they'd actually now be subject to higher labor and environmental standards than they currently are. So it is more likely that a U.S. worker is going to be competing on a level playing field with a worker in Mexico than he is under current law. If the voting Congress in the House, which is the one we are anticipating perhaps as early as next week, does not go your way, is that a disavowal of the Pacific trade treaty? Is it dead if that happens? Well first of all I-I never hypothesize that we are not going to get this done because it is the right thing for the American people and- You must think about it though. You know, I am pretty confident we are going to be able to get this done. I think it will-but understand, all this does is give me the authority to negotiate the deal. And once we complete the deal, before I sign the deal, I have got to give Congress and the American people and the press 60 days in which this every provision every page is posted on a website. People can go through it line by line. If there is anything that I have promised that is not in there, they will be able to point it out. Then I sign it, and then there is going to be a couple of months of congressional debate around the specifics of the trade agreement and they can still vote it down. So part of the-the thing I try to emphasize is is that I am confident enough that this will be good for the American people that once you have a chance to take a look at it, you are gonna see, and I think people in Washington people in Seattle will be able to see, that you know if you are a wine maker, if you are a farmer, if you are part of an IT company in Washington- this is going to open up markets for you, put you in a better footing in terms of the 95% of the world's markets that are outside of the United States. Ultimately it is gonna be good for your bottom line. Thank you ENTITY. Really enjoyed it. I think if I ask one more question I will be tossed out. Thank you so much.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdennisboundsking5", "title": "Interview With Dennis Bounds of KING 5", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dennis-bounds-king-5", "publication_date": "04-06-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 348, "text": "What is the most important thing you have learned about your two years here? : You know, I will get knocked down a couple of times; but whatever I am going through, it is nothing like what families around the country are going through. And if they are able to keep going, even when things do not go the way they want, then I sure can as well. We spoke to in the Oval Office exactly two years to the day after he was elected , and two days after he suffered his worst political defeat: : What I am going to do is I am going to reach out to Republican -- What can we work on together? But the Republican leadership is not eager to compromise, and finds himself reevaluating where he goes from here, and reflecting on his first two years in office. Do you think you were naive? is on a trade mission in India tonight, following a long flight, and an even longer week which saw him lose his Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and nearly lose it in the Senate. Although his name was not on the ballot, his performance in office was certainly a factor in the outcome. Late on Thursday afternoon, two years to the date after his election as the 44th , we sat down with him in the Oval Office and the mood was different. We talked about Tuesday's vote, the economy, and where he goes from here. The Republicans have said this was a referendum on you and the Democratic Party. Do you agree with that? : I think, first and foremost, it was a referendum on the economy, and the party in power was held responsible for an economy that is still underperforming and where a lot of folks are still hurting. At your news conference you seemed unwilling to accept the idea that this was a rejection, in any way, of your agenda and your policies. Is this defeat a reflection on your leadership? : I think that what happened over the course of two years was that we had to take a series of big emergency steps quickly, and most of them in the first six months of my administration. Each of them had a big price tag, and people looked at that and they said, Boy, this feels as if there is a huge expansion of government. And what -- Well, it was a huge expansion of government. : What I did not effectively, I think, drive home is that we were taking these steps not because of some theory that we wanted to expand government; it was because we had an emergency situation and we wanted to make sure the economy did not go off a cliff. I think the Republicans were able to paint my governing philosophy as a classic, traditional, big-government liberal, and that is not something that the American people want. The Republicans say the voters sent you a very clear message -- that they want a smaller, less costly, more accountable government. Is that the message that you received? : I think that the -- first and foremost, they want jobs and economic growth in this country. Are you saying, then, that this small -- idea of smaller, less costly, more accountable government was not what you think the voters were saying? : No, no, no. There is no doubt that folks are concerned about debt and deficits. I think that is absolutely a priority. And, by the way, that is a concern that I had before I was every sworn in. You lost a lot of your base on Tuesday. A lot of the people that helped elect you two years ago voted for Republicans -- women, senior citizens, independents; young people and African- Americans did not turn out in large numbers. How do you explain that? : Well, as I said, I think that folks are frustrated with what they have seen over the last two years. You know, one of the challenges we had was that we had lost 4 million jobs in the six months before I was sworn in; we lost 750,000 jobs the month I was sworn in; 600,000 the month after that; 600,000 the month after that. So what you -- what you had was the economy continuing to get worse in the first several months of my administration, before any of our economic policies had a chance to be put into place. Appropriately, I am held accountable for that. You ran as somebody who was going to come to Washington and change it, and in the end, as some of your predecessors, it ended up changing you -- : You know, I -- -- to a certain extent. : I am not -- You have not given up. : Exactly. I think it is fair to say it has not changed me in terms of my ideals. But I think that in terms of how I operated on a day-to-day basis, when you have got a series of choices to make, I think that were are times where we said, Let us just get it done, instead of worrying about how we are getting it done. And I think that is a problem. I am paying a political price for that. Well, to a certain extent, the Tea Party and some of the Republicans ran on the same message, or much of the same message that you ran on two years ago, which is, We are going to change Washington, and now you are Washington. : Well, that is one of the dangers of assuming power. And, you know, when you are campaigning I think you are liberated to say things without thinking about, Okay, how am I going to actually, practically implement this? Do you think you were naive? : No, I do not think I was naive; I just think that these things are hard to do. You know, this is a big country, and democracy is an inherently messy business; and Congress is an institution that has a whole lot of tradition, some of them that are not , you know, all that healthy; and there are a lot of special interests who've got a lot of power. It is a hard, long slog to push up against that. But I think you make a good point, ENTITY, which is that you now have a lot of Republicans who ran as outsiders who are coming in, and my hope is, is that we may be in a position now where the two sides meet and agree on some things that need to be changed. is talking about ear marks -- billions of dollars in political pork dispensed each year by the congressional leadership. The Tea Party and conservative Republicans want to end the practice, and is now ready to help them, even though he tolerated ear marks to pass key legislation. He says it was just one of his regrets. Are there things that you wish you could do over? : Oh, I think -- Pull back? : -- I think there are things every day that I think about doing better. I mean, I think that one of the areas that a lot of folks have focused on, obviously, is the health-care bill. Right. : Because, after we took a whole series of these emergency measures to save the economy -- the stimulus, the steps to shore up the banking system, the auto bailout -- I think there were some that argued, well, you should just stop and let people digest all these changes. And so you should not take on something as big as health care. And I will be honest with you, ENTITY, at the time, we knew that it probably was not great politics, because -- You were told that by your aides. : Absolutely. And the reason is, is -- there is a reason why our health-care system has not been reformed over the last several decades, why every president talks about it and it never happens, because it is hard. It is a huge, big, complicated system. I made the decision to go ahead and do it, and it proved as costly politically as we expected -- probably actually a little more costly than we expected, politically. In what ways? : Well, partly because I could not get the kind of cooperation from Republicans that I had hoped for. We thought that if we shaped a bill that was not that different from bills that had previously been introduced by Republicans, including the Republican governor in Massachusetts who is now running for president, that we would be able to find some common ground there, and we just could not . And that was costly party because it created the kind of partisanship and bickering that really turned people off. You have mentioned a couple of times the emergency that you faced when you came into office, and you have mentioned continually the unemployment problem and the economy. This emergency -- is it over? : Not for the people who are out of work. I think that the way to think about it is the dangers of a second Big Recession are now much reduced; the danger of us tipping into a Great Depression, I think most economists would say, is not -- is not out there on the horizon. What is a danger is that we stay stuck in a new normal, where unemployment rates stay high. People who have jobs see their incomes go up, businesses make big profits; but they have learned to do more with less, and so they do not hire. And as a consequence, we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the 8 million jobs that were lost. That is a danger. So that is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. Do you get discouraged? Are you discouraged now? : I do get discouraged. I mean, were times when I thought that the economy would have gotten better by now. You know, one of the things I think you understand, as , is you are held responsible for everything, but you do not always have control over everything; and especially in an economy this big, there are limited tools to encourage the kind of job growth that we need. I am constantly reminded that we have been through worse times than these and we have always come out on top. And I am positive that the same thing is going to happen this time. You spent nearly a trillion dollars on the stimulus package; you have got short -- short-term interest rates are zero -- practically zero, and still the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. What can you do to create jobs that has not already been done? : Some of this is going to be just a matter of the economy healing. There are some things we can do to accelerate growth. We still -- we have got a couple of trillion dollars worth of infrastructure improvements that need to be made around the country. I mean, there are construction crews all across the country that are dying for work, and companies that are willing to take a very small profit to get work done. And so for us to say, Now is the time for us to rebuild this country and equip ourselves for the 21st century, that is something that could make a real difference. But -- But the Republicans are not interested in spending and infrastructure right now. They do not want stimulus programs. : Well, you know, again, historically, rebuilding our infrastructure is something that has garnered Democratic and Republican support. I want to have a conversation with them and see if that is still the case. The political landscape has changed. I mean, how do you plan to govern? President Clinton found himself in a very, very similar circumstance, and he reacted by pivoting to the middle, and was successful in it. Is that what you are going to do? : Well, I -- what I -- You have to, do not you. : -- what I am going to do is I am going to reach out to Republicans, and I am going to say there is -- What can we work on together? And -- Have not you tried that? : Well, I have, but I am going to keep on trying. But, so far, the Republicans are not showing much interest. No sooner than had left on his trip to Asia, Republican Congressman John Boehner, the next speaker of the House, questioned whether had gotten the voters' message. Boehner and Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, oppose any new spending and vowed to repeal or decimate health-care reform and slash more than $100 billion from next year's budget. Tea Party activists are demanding even deeper cuts. The Tea Party -- according to the exit polls, four out of 10 voters on Tuesday said they supported the movement. How seriously do you take the Tea Party, and will it make the task of finding common ground with the Republican Party more difficult? : Well, it'll be interesting to see how it evolves. We have a long tradition in this country of a desire for limited government, of a suspicion of the federal government, of a concern that government spends too much money. You know, I mean, that is as American as apple pie. But you are still confronted with the fact that the vast majority of the federal budget are things that people really think are important, like Social Security, and Medicare and defense. I mean, we are going to have to, you know, tackle some big issues, like entitlements, that, you know, when you -- when you listen to the Tea Party, or you listen to Republican candidates, they promise We are not going to touch. Those are the choices that I think Republicans and Tea Party members are going to have to confront in a serious way. You have -- I would say, do not have a very close relationship with Mr. McConnell -- Senator McConnell and Congressman Boehner. What do you think of these guys? : Both John and Mitch are very smart; they are capable; they have been able to I think organize the Republican Caucus very effectively in opposition to a lot of the things that we tried to do over the last two years, and that takes real political skill. You know, my assumption is, is that we are going to be able to work together. And whenever we have had conversations -- here at the White House or over on Capitol Hill, they have always been cordial. It is just in the newspapers that they have been -- : Well -- -- less than cordial. : Okay, the -- during election season, I think the rhetoric flies. And by the way, I have been guilty of that; it is not just them. Part of my promise to the American people when I was elected was to maintain the kind of tone that says we can disagree without being disagreeable, and I think over the course of two years there have been times where I have slipped on that commitment. When we come back, talks about his upcoming negotiations with the Republican leadership over tax cuts, affecting nearly every American, that are about to expire, and considers whether, halfway through his term, he is lost his mojo. 's next big challenge, working with the Republicans, will begin in two weeks when he meets with the congressional leadership. The Bush-era tax cuts automatically expire at the end of year unless Congress renews them. wants to keep the tax breaks for middle-class families earning less than $250,000 a year; he would let them expire for wealthier taxpayers. The Republicans want the tax cuts extended for everyone to keep the economy moving. Are you ready to compromise on the Bush tax cuts? : I think we are going to have to have a serious conversation about it. Here is an example where I'd like to think we could at least settle on those things we agree on. I think both Democrats and Republicans agree that for people making $250,000 a year or less, the last thing we want right now is to see their taxes go up. Not only would it be bad for them, but it'd be bad for the economy as a whole. For folks who are making more than $250,000 a year -- you and me, ENTITY -- you know, the question is: Can we afford to borrow $700 billion -- That is what it is? : -- that is how much it would cost over the course of 10 years -- to give us an extra tax break? Look, you know, sometimes I think this debate gets framed as if I think rich people -- folks who are doing well, should be punished. Part of what America is all about is going out there and getting rich. And, you know, if you make a good product, you provide a good service, god bless you, I want you to do well. That is -- and then you can plow that money back into creating jobs, and building your businesses -- that is terrific. What I -- what I do not think makes sense is for us to borrow $700 billion to pay for that. And we do not have the money. I mean, everybody's already talking about our deficit; why would we want to add to it? Now, having said all that, I understand -- The Republicans want everybody -- : -- I understand the -- -- to get it. : -- I understand the Republicans have a different view. And so we are going to have to have a negotiation, and I am open to, you know, finding a way in which they can meet their principles and I can meet mine. But in order to do that, I think we do have to answer the question of how we pay for it. Congressman Boehner has offered you a compromise back in September. He suggested extending the tax break for the wealthiest for two more years, and rolling back the discretionary government spending to levels before the bailout in 2008. Is that something that you could live with? : I think that when we start getting specific like that, there is a basis for a conversation. I think that what that means is, is that, you know, we can look at what the budget projections are; we can think about what the economy needs right now, given that it is still weak; and hopefully we can agree on a set of facts that leads to a compromise. Do you want to make a counterproposal to him right now? : I think -- I have already invited them over to the White House, and, you know, there are going to be a bunch of discussions. But I think -- I think we can make progress on this. The point of view of a lot of people is why would you want to tax or raise taxes on the people who have money to spend -- not necessarily the wealthiest people in America; you are not talking about Goldman Sachs here, you are talking about small business people who maybe make $250,000 a year? : Well -- Why would you want to take that money back when you are looking to try -- and they have got money to spend, to put it into the economy? : Well, the truth is, is that the way this thing works out, it is folks who are millionaires and billionaires who get the biggest breaks. And it turns out that actually the people who are most likely to use that money and spend that money are actually people of more modest means. And if what we are concerned about how we can grow the economy, there are more efficient ways to recirculate dollars out there and get people to spend. This is a perception out there that you are anti business. : Well, I think there is no doubt that the relationship with the business community, over the course of the last two years, at times has gotten strained. And so I think that we have got some repair to do there. These were exceptional circumstances over the last two years. I think we have to make sure that people understand and business understands that my overarching philosophy is not one in which we have constantly increasing government intervention; although I do think that some of the provisions we put in place to protect consumers, to create a regulatory framework where we do not have a repeat of the kind of crisis we had in the banking sector, those have to be preserved. One of the things that is -- that drives business crazy is this idea that they do not know what is going on. They have trouble planning. They do not know what the tax rate is going to be. They are not convinced that things are getting better. : Well, there are two separate arguments here. I think a lot of businesses still do not know what the economy is doing -- there is still a lot of uncertain data out there; and we are still working through some big problems in the economy -- the housing market is a huge headwind. Now the second part of uncertainty -- and this is the one the Republicans focused a lot on during the campaign -- is we got a new health-care law, we have got a new financial regulatory reform law, we do not know what all these regulations coming out of various agencies might be, and so that is making people hesitate. And, you know, I think that it is entirely legitimate that -- in the banking sector, let us say, it is very important for us to write these rules in collaboration with interested parties so that they can start knowing how things are going to work; when it comes to health care, we need to be consulting with the insurance industry to make sure they know how things are going to work. There is this feeling, particularly among people who are among your most ardent supporters, who feel a little disappointed, that they think that you have lost your mojo -- -- that you have lost your ability, that touch you had during the camping to inspire and lead, that -- you know, everybody in Washington writes about the, sort of, aloofness that you have. And I am sure that drives you crazy -- that you have let other people define you, that you have not sold your successes well enough. : I think it is -- I think it is a fair argument. You know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, yeah, leadership is not just legislation, that it is a matter of persuading people, and giving them confidence, and bringing them together, and setting a tone. We have not always been successful at that, and I take personal responsibility for that, and it is something that I have got to examine carefully as I go forward. I will say that, when it comes to some of my supporters, part of it I think is the belief that if I'd just communicated things better, that I'd be able to persuade that half of the country that voted for John McCain that we were right and they were wrong. You know, one of the things that I think it is important for people to remember is that, you know, this country does not just agree with The New York Times editorial page; and, you know, I can make some really good arguments defending the Democratic position, and there are going to be some people who just do not agree me, and that is okay. One thing that is not been okay with a lot of people has been his eagerness to spread that gospel to the far reaches of the broadcast cable universe. It seems like he has been almost everywhere -- Leno, and Letterman, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, America's Most Wanted, and The View. Some find it demeaning and unpresidential. I do not know if you saw this cartoon. : Let me take a look at it. Body by Bam -- : Body by Bam -- -- from the Daily News. : The challenge right now -- and you know this better than I do, ENTITY -- is that it used to be ENTITY could call a press conference, and the three major networks would come, and he'd talk to them, and he pretty much reached everybody in America. And these days the closest I can get to that is being on 60 Minutes. But there are a whole bunch of folks who watch The Daily Show, or watch The View, and so I have got to adapt the presidency to reach as many people as possible, in as many settings as possible, so that they can hear directly from me. You know, but this is an example where, you know, on the one hand folks say, Well, you know, he is a little too remote; then if I am on The View, Well, you know, he should not be, you know, on some day- time TV show. My attitude is, if I am reaching people, if I am talking to them, I am willing to take the risks of overexposure on that front. You are halfway through -- just about halfway through your first term. What is the most important thing you have learned about, in two years here, about yourself, about the job? : You know, I think that I have learned that America is incredibly resilient. I think I have learned about myself that I am pretty resilient too; you know, that, you know, I will get knocked down a couple of times, but whatever I am going through, it is nothing like what families around the country are going through.

{"id": 239, "text": "Before you ask questions, I just want to say that I really have appreciated the stories you have done, because I think it is so important that it is sort of a balance thing, but I want to raise public awareness of this and awareness also with people with influence who can influence decisionmaking without throwing people into an unnecessary panic. And I think these stories have been exceedingly valuable. Sandy was making fun of me today before you came in Sandy Berger was. He said, When you started talking about this 6 years ago, nobody around here people just did not they had not thought about it. Six years ago. I have been asking them to think about this for a long, long time. And of course, we had it more or less in the context of terrorism because we had the World Trade Center and all the other things to worry about. But anyway. But actually, one of my first questions because we have heard so many rumors about how you got interested, and none of what has happened would have happened without your interest. But what was it? Well, it was first of all, I spend a lot of time thinking about 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now. I think that is one of the things that Presidents are supposed to do and especially when things are changing so much. But we had keep in mind, we had the World Trade Center issue; we had the CIA killer; and then later you had the incident in the Tokyo subway and then Oklahoma City. We have had a lot of terrorist incidents, culminating in the bombing of our Embassies in Africa and what happened in Khobar, other things. One of the things that I have worried about from the beginning, with the breakdown of the Soviet Union before my time here, was how to help them deal with the aftermath of the massive nuclear system they have, and starting with the Nunn-Lugar funds, going all the way up to our threat reduction proposals in this year's budget you know, we tried to hire keep the scientists and the labs working and do joint projects of all kinds that would be constructive. But it was pretty obvious to me that, given the size of the Soviet biological and chemical programs and the fact that we know a lot of other nations are trying to develop chemical capacity and some biological capacity, that we had not only nuclear problems but we have a chemical and biological problem. And of course, the Vice President and others sort of sensitized me to this whole computer problem. We had the incident with the defense computers just a few months ago. But before that, I kept reading about all these non in the line of national security all these computer hackers. You know, I am technologically challenged. I can do E-mail and a few other things, you know. But it struck me that we were going to have to find some way to try to deal with that, too, because of the defense implications, as well as the other possibilities. And I have had all kinds of I also find that reading novels, futuristic novels sometimes people with an imagination are not wrong Preston's novel about biological warfare, which is very much based on Hot Zone or Cobra Event ? Which one impressed you? The Cobra Event. That is the one. Well, The Hot Zone was interesting to me because of the Ebola thing, because that was a fact book. But I thought The Cobra Event was interesting, especially when he said what his sources were, which seemed fairly credible to me. And then I read another book about a group of terrorists shutting down the telephone networks in the Northeast and the Midwest. What was that? Do you remember? I cannot remember. I read so many things. I cannot remember. A couple years ago. But anyway, when I and a lot of times it is just for thrills, but a lot of times these people are not far off. You know, they sell books by imagining the future, and sometimes they are right; sometimes they are wrong. So I have gotten I do not want to sound I have gotten a lot of sort of solid, scientific input. I have also solicited opinions from people working on the genome project, for example, and about what the implications of that might be for dealing with biological warfare. And last year, we had a whole group of experts come in here and spend an extended amount of time with me and then follow up with the staff on biological issues in particular. So I have had a real interest in this, and I think we are about to get up to speed. But we just have to be prepared for it. I mean, it is if you look back through all of human history, people who are interested in gaining control or influence or advantage over others have brought to bear the force of arms. And what normally happens, from the beginning of history, is the arms work until a defense is erected, and then there is an equilibrium until there is a new offensive system developed, and then a defense comes up going all the way back to well, even before it, but castle moats which were overcome by catapults. And so, basically, I think what has concerned me is that we, because we are moving from one big issue will there be a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union to now a whole lot of proliferation of issues, dealing with smaller scale nuclear issues, chemical and biological issues, missile technology, and of course, the related computer cyber-crime issue is that I just do not want the lag time between offense and defense to be any longer than is absolutely necessary. That, I think, is the challenge for us, is to try to before anything really tragic happens not only in the United States but anywhere else. We have had enough warning signs out there now, enough concrete evidence, and we need to close the door of the gap between the offense and defense. How worried should we be, and how we do not want to panic people. And research has seen some of these warning signs, and readers call, and they want to know, is this how worried should we be? Is this serious today, and is the threat rising? Is it going be more serious in the future? I would say that if the issue is how probable is it in the very near-term an American city or community would be affected, I'd say you probably should not be too worried. But if the issue is, is it a near certainty that at some time in the future there will be some group, probably a terrorist group, that attempts to bring to bear either the use or the threat of a chemical or biological operation, I would say that is highly likely to happen sometime in the next few years. And therefore, I would say the appropriate response is not worry or panic but taking this issue very seriously, expecting all elected officials with any responsibility in this area to know everything they can, and to do everything we can both to erect all possible defenses and then to try to make sure we are doing everything we can to stop this. Now, we know right now we know that a lot of what we have done already has delayed WMD programs, some of which I cannot talk about, but slowed the development of WMD programs, of missile technology development that might deliver such weapons and other things. And we are doing everything we can to stop or slow down the ability of others, insofar as we know about it and can do something about it. And meanwhile, we are doing everything we can both to develop defenses and emergency responses. But I think we have got an enormous amount of work out there ahead of us, an enormous amount of work. And a lot of this has to be done with great cooperation between the Federal Government we need cooperation of the private sector on the cyber issues, the computer issues. We need cooperation with local government on public health response issues, exposure if there appears to be an outbreak. We had all these sort of false alarms of anthrax in California how many? more than a dozen, I think, in the last month. So we need to be able to diagnose and to treat and also to manage those things. Does one of these threats worry you more than another, and does any one in particular keep you awake at night? Well, I have spent some late nights thinking a lot about this and reading a lot about it. I think in terms of offense versus defense, if you go back to where we started, the thing that I am most interested in and you will see we have allocated several hundred million dollars basically to research and to applied research the thing that I am most interested in is developing the ability to quickly contain biological agents. A chemical attack would be horrible, but it would be finite. You know, it is just like for the people who went through Oklahoma City, nothing could be more horrible. But it did not spread. The thing that bothers people about biological agents is that, unless they are properly diagnosed, contained, and treated, that it could spread. For example, we know that if all of us went to a rally on The Mall tomorrow with 10,000 people, and somebody flew a low-flying crop duster and sprayed us all with biological agents from, let us say 200 feet, that no matter how toxic it were, half of us would walk away, for reasons no one quite understands. You know, either we would not breathe it, or we'd have some miraculous resistance to it. And the other half of us, somebody would have to diagnose in a hurry and then contain and treat. Otherwise, it would be kind of like the gift that keeps on giving, you know. And I do not mean that I am not trying to be macabre, but you asked me what keeps me awake at night, and that bothers me. And that is why the thing that I thought was most important about what we did last year, and what we learned a little bit from our defense scare even though it was on a computer issue, we had this defense issue, plus we were dealing with all this we'd studied for a year all this especially this biological issue is we had this work going on in 12 different places in the Government. So we had to organize our efforts so that we could be accessible to local governments, so we could work with them to set up their own preventive mechanisms. And I have to tell you, it may be we may have to await it is a note I made to myself that we may have to have a perfect defense, I mean, instantaneous. We may have to depend upon the genome project, interestingly enough, because once the human genes' secrets are unlocked, then if you and I think we have been infected, they could take a blood sample, and there would be a computer program which would show us if we had, let us say, we had a variant of anthrax. Let us suppose some terrorist hired a genius scientist and a laboratory to take basic anthrax and put some variant in it that would be resistant to all known anthrax antidotes. Okay. Or a Russian scientist. Yes. So let us just suppose that happened. And what you would want is to be able to take a blood sample, do an analysis, put it through a software program that had already been developed, and say, Okay, here is this is how the genes are different. This is the difference. And then presumably, not too long after we have developed this, they will already know, well, therefore, this is how you should how you should change the vaccine. And we know now I know this is kind of bewildering, but keep in mind this is actually good news because, if there were no genome project, if there were no rapid way to do quick analysis that would go right to the tiniest variant, we would be in trouble. And now these scientists are working on this, and we are actually a little bit ahead of the original predicted timetable on unlocking the secrets of the gene. And when that happens, one of the side benefits, I think, will be to be able to tell these things much more quickly. But meanwhile, we have got this plan. We are stockpiling the vaccines, and we are doing all this research which the Government has to fund, because obviously there is no market for it, right? It is not like there is no market for it, and I hope there never will be any market for it. But we have to pay, the Government has to pay for this research to develop new vaccines and to manage it along. And I think we will do I think we have got a very good increase in the budget, and I really think it will have broad bipartisan support. There is a school of worrywarts out there that says this genome stuff is a double-edged sword, and at some point you can envision ethnic weapons, looking at racial differences and try to do selective And targeting. Look at Kosovo. Look at how much of the blood that has spilled is just rooted in this ethnic Yes, but I think to be fair, we are a good ways away from that. I think we need to worry far more about the fact that most of these groups we know, for example let us take something I can talk about because it is public record. We know Usama bin Ladin's network has made an effort to get chemical weapons. Biological or just chemical? Well, we know they have made an effort to get chemical weapons; they may have made an effort to get biological weapons. We do not know that they have them. It is true if you take this thing out to sort of the science fiction conclusion, obviously the genome project itself carries the seeds of its own misuse. But right now I am absolutely convinced that the advantages dwarf the disadvantages in this area. Plus, which all the other advantages of it I mean, it is going to lead us to we will save countless lives because we will know in advance what predisposition people have, what problems they have the genome project would be the seminal event you know, when it is done, of the first part of the 21st century, there is no doubt about that. But to come back to your point, the only point I would make, whenever you ask me a question like that, I think it is best for you to remember the formulation that I started with, and it is interesting to think about the moat and the catapult, the spear and the shield anything. It is all a question of people who have money, organization, and an interest, whether it is political or financial or religious or whatever, in oppressing other people or holding them down, will always be looking for new offensive weapons. Our goal should always be, for the sake of the world as well as the security of the American people, to make sure not only that we can defend ourselves and counter-punch, if you will, but to develop with each new wave of technology to close the gap between offense and defense. And if we do that, I think that is the strategy that I hope will become at least an integral part of our national security strategy in the WMD area. ENTITY, in the interim we have a lot of Americans, more than 2 million Americans in uniform, being vaccinated against anthrax. Are you vaccinated? The Secret Service told me I could not discuss that, and they have good reasons for not wanting me to do it. But let me say, I am convinced that like any other vaccination, there may be some small rejection, but I think on balance it is a safe procedure. I have looked at the reports, and I think on balance, given the fact that we send so many of our men and women in uniform into places where they could be exposed, I think that they are better off being vaccinated. I do not believe that the threat in the United States is sufficient that I could recommend that to people, to the public at large. What about first responders or people in hospitals who might be exposed to smallpox, anthrax, plague, and things like that? The real answer there is, we have not reached a conclusion, but we are considering that. Because we have to work with the first responders, we have got the public health people looking into this and other people, and I think that that is a judgment that ought to be made primarily by people who are in the best position to make a professional judgment about it. So that is something that is being considered. We have heard about something else that is being considered that I think Bill wants to ask you about. As you may be aware, Secretary Cohen and people at the Pentagon are talking about trying to create a new position of commander in chief for the continental United States because of the terror threat. And it is moving through the system, and at some point it is going to come to you, probably sometime this summer. Are you inclined to create that kind of position for the military? Let me say, I think that we need to have an organized response, if you will, to what you might call homeland defense on CBW and cyber or computer terrorism issues. And now we have established a national coordinator on these issues in the White House. We have got this national domestic preparation office at the Justice Department. We have got a National Infrastructure Protection Center. We have got a joint task force on cyber defense already at DOD in response to what they went through before. So I want them to look at where we are and make some recommendations to me. I am not sure that that is what they are going to recommend, and I think that I should not give an answer to the question you ask until I see what the range of options are and what the range of recommendations is. Do you have a leaning one way or another? No, just except to say that it is very important that we outline every single responsibility that we have as a nation at the national level and that someone be responsible for it. I want to know as I said, one of the things that we learned last year that I think was a legitimate criticism of what we have done in our administration is that we had 12 different places where these activities were going on, and they were not being properly coordinated and driven in the proper fashion. And we have tried to resolve this. And this is sort of the last big kind of organizational piece, as far as I know, that is yet to be resolved. So the military is going to make me a recommendation, and I will respond accordingly. Again, the American people this should not be a cause for alarm; this should be a cause for reassurance. They should want us to be wellorganized on these things because remember, for years and years, when I was a boy, we used to do all those they had all these fallout shelters, and every school had its drills and all that. I mean, I am older than you, so you would not remember this, but No, we did it. But you know, and we it was a sensible thing to do under the circumstances. Thank God we never experienced it. But it was the sensible thing to do. And so what I want us to do is everything, within reason, we can to minimize our exposure and risks here, and that is how I am going to evaluate this Pentagon recommendation. Secretary Cohen, I think, is also real focused on this now. I have been very pleased with the priority he is given it. And I think that all these guys know that after their experience with the computer issue that all this tomorrow's threats may be very different from yesterday's, and we have got to be ready. What do you say to people, to skeptics who say all this is just Pentagon maneuvering, creating new bogeymen to scare us so they can whip up new budget authority? And it is and that is a large crowd. Even though we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars and in the aggregate a few billion dollars, it is nowhere near as expensive as maintaining this sort of basic infrastructure of defense; the case of public health, the basic infrastructure of public health. I say to them, they should understand that we have intelligence and a lot of it is in the public arena, you all write about it about all the countries that are trying the countries and the groups that want chemical weapons, that want biological weapons, that are trying to get agents, precursor agents that you can use to develop chemicals or basic agents you can use to develop biological weapons. And everybody knows now the world is full of hackers that seek to intrude on networks, that seek to insert bogus codes into programs, and all this sort of stuff. And it would be completely irresponsible for us not to allocate a substantial investment in trying to protect America from threats that will be, in all probability, as likely or more likely in the future than the threats we think we face today. That is why we started this conversation by saying, I do not want to say anything that will overly alarm anybody. I am not trying to stir up a lot of false threats. But if you look at just what the UNSCOM people in Iraq they say that they do not believe that the reporting in Iraq is consistent with what they believe the chemical capacity there is. If you look at the fact with regard to chemicals, with the Chemical Weapons Convention, if we can get it properly implemented, at least we will be able to track probably, that plus intelligence, large volumes of chemical stocks. But with biological stocks, a very small laboratory with the right materials to work with, you could develop supplies that could kill a large number of people. It simply is irresponsible for us not to both do the best we can with public health protections, do the best research we can on vaccines, stockpile what we know works, and then get out there and try to build a defense and an ability to interrupt and stop, with export controls and any other way we can, these developments. And it costs money. But to me, it is money well spent. And if there is never an incident, nobody would be happier than me 20 years from now if the same critics would be able to say, Oh, see, Clinton was a kook; nothing happened. I would be the happiest man on Earth. I would be the happiest man on Earth. If they could say, He overexaggerated it; nothing happened; all he did was make a bunch of jobs for scientists and build the Pentagon budget, I would be elated 20 years from now to be subject to that criticism because it would mean that nothing happened, and in no small measure because of the efforts we have made. Since we have so little time left, ENTITY, Russia. How can you be sure since they violated the treaty that they signed banning biological weapons for 20 years, does it make sense to work with them now on biological projects? Are you certain that they are not doing biological research? And what do you do? Let me say this. I think that the more we work with them and the more their scientists are working with us and the more successful we are in building a common endeavor, the more it will be in their interest to comply. The real danger in Russia, I think dangers are two. One is I will take one that is outside the CBW area so it does not look like I am waving the red flag here. When we started the space station you know, John Glenn went up and then we sent the first two components of the space station up it had been months since a lot of those Russian scientists had been paid. That is why it is very, very important, I think, to say we value this enormous infrastructure of scientific expertise they have in the space area, in the CBW area, and we want to work with them. This budget of mine would enable us to do joint work with 8,000 Russian scientists. Now, there are, I think, 40,000 total we think. But that is important. That bothers me. The second thing that concerns me is that when Russia shed communism, they adopted a strategy which was widely lauded at the time in the United States and elsewhere, but they were actually when I went to Russia, and you remember right after my mother died I got on the plane, and I went to the Czech Republic and Russia that was, what, January of '94. Actually, at that time the Czech Republic was doing very well and was sort of the poster child of the new economy in the former Communist countries. But when I was there, Russia had actually privatized more property than the Czech Republic had. And this relates partly to the economic crisis, but when they did it, they did it without having had the benefit of an effective central bank, a securities and exchange commission, all these other things, so that you had money coming in and money flying out now. And one of the problems they have now is that it is not a totalitarian Government anymore; there are a lot of private companies all the private companies there by definition used to be part of the state, unless they are new businesses. And so one of the problems we are having is, even when they are trying to help us, is keeping up with what all these companies and their subsidiaries do. And that is been the tension that you have written a lot about and there is been a lot in the press about was there missile cooperation with Iran or not, and does that violate our understanding, and does that call for some action visa-vis Russia? And part of the problem is just keeping up with this proliferation of companies and people that used to have some connection to the Soviet State, some connection to the defense apparatus. It is not a simple process, and it is not a perfect process, but I am absolutely convinced that this threat reduction initiative we have got can kind of intensify our efforts to work with them, as well as to really implement the Chemical Weapons Treaty and get some teeth in the Biological Weapons Convention. That is very, very important. I think that is the best strategy. It may not be perfect, but it is better than the alternative. What do you do if the nightmare comes to pass, and some country hits us, hits us hard, with a biological weapon? What kind of response would you do? Well, first of all, if some country were thinking about doing that, I would certainly hope that they would not have the capacity to do it before we could stop them or interrupt them, if it was a that is, if you are talking about somebody lobbing a missile over here or something like that. I think if it happened, it would be an act of war, and there would be a very strong response. But I think we have demonstrated that. But I think the far more likely thing is somebody representing some interest maybe it could be a rogue state; maybe it could be a terrorist network walking around a city with a briefcase full of vials or in spray cans, you know. So what we have to do any country with any sense, if they wanted to attack us, would try to do it through a terrorist network, because if they did it with a missile we'd know who did it, and then they'd be sunk. It would be that is a deal where they are bound to lose, big time. Would you respond with nuclear weapons to a biological attack? Well, I never discuss the nuclear issue. I do not think that is appropriate. But I think that we would have at least a proportionate, if not a disproportionate, response if someone committed an act of war against the United States. That is what we would do. And if somebody willfully murdered a lot of our civilians, there would be a very heavy price to pay. ENTITY, you have time for one more We are about to go. Did you have a chance to watch any of Senator Bumpers' presentation today? I did. It is the only thing I have watched. I watched that. He said he criticized the House managers for lacking compassion for your family. He described your family as a family that has been about as decimated as a family can get. The relationship between husband and wife, father and child, has been incredibly strained if not destroyed. Is that an accurate representation? Well, it is been I would say it has been a strain for my family. But we have worked very hard, and I think we have come through the worst. We love each other very much, and we have worked on it very hard. But I think he was showing you know, he knows me and Hillary and Chelsea, and we have all been friends, as he said, for 25 years. I think he was just trying to inject a human element into what he was saying.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjudithmillerandwilliamjbroadthenewyorktimes", "title": "Interview With Judith Miller and William J.

{"id": 374, "text": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. I am very pleased indeed to welcome ENTITY and his delegation, Mrs. ENTITY, and young Barbara. We are very pleased indeed, ENTITY, that you were able to come. It is very important for us because of the importance of the United States to our future and the United States to the future of our continent. We have had very good discussions with ENTITY, able to cover quite a wide field. We are very pleased with the development of the bilateral relations, strong economic links, growing all the time. Continued attention by the U.S. corporate world on South Africa is very critically important for us. AGOA has had a very big impact in terms of the development of our economy, and we continue to work on all of these matters. It also gave us a chance to convey our thanks to ENTITY for the support with regards to meeting the African continental challenges. That includes questions of peace and security, the NEPAD processes, again, very important for the future of our continent. That, of course, also gave an opportunity to discuss some of the specific areas of conflict around the continent. I must say, ENTITY, that at the end of these discussions, we, all of us, feel enormously strengthened by your very, very firm and clear commitment to assist us to meet the challenges that we have got to meet domestically and on the African Continent. And therefore, ENTITY, thank you very much indeed for coming. We-the visit will certainly result in strengthened bilateral relations and strengthened cooperation to meet these other challenges that we face together. But welcome, ENTITY. ENTITY, thanks. Gosh, we are honored to be here. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality. Thank Mrs. ENTITY as well for her gracious hospitality. It is a pleasure to be in South Africa. Your Nation's recent history is a great story of courage and persistence in the pursuit of justice. This is a country that threw off oppression and is now the force of freedom and stability and a force for progress throughout the continent of Africa. I appreciate our strong relationship, and it is a vital relationship. And ENTITY, I want to thank you very much for working hard to make it a vital and strong relationship. We have met quite a few times in the recent past, and every time we have met, I have -I feel refreshed and appreciate very much your advice and counsel and your leadership. I appreciate ENTITY's dedication to openness and accountability. He is advancing these principles in the New Partnership for African Development, the leader in that effort. ENTITY and I believe that the partnership can help extend democracy and free markets and transparency across the continent of Africa.ENTITY has shown great leadership in this initiative, and our country will support the leaders who accept the principles of reform, and we will work with them. So thank you, ENTITY. South Africa is playing a critical role in promoting regional security in Africa, and we discussed ENTITY's leadership, for example, in Burundi. South Africa has helped achieve the peaceful inauguration of a new ENTITY. Or in the Congo, South Africa brokered an agreement on the creation of a transitional government. And in Zimbabwe, I have encouraged ENTITY and his Government to continue to work for the return of democracy in that important country. I also discussed with ENTITY the importance of the continued cooperation in the global war on terror. The United States and South Africa are working together to strengthen this nation's border security and law enforcement. And we are devoting $100 million to help countries in eastern Africa increase their counterterror efforts. We are determined to fight and to join our friends to fight terrorists throughout this continent, throughout the world. We are also committed to helping African nations achieve peace. In Liberia, the United States strongly supports the cease-fire agreement signed last month. President Taylor needs to leave Liberia so that his country can be spared further grief and bloodshed. Yesterday, I talked with President Kufuor of Ghana, who leads ECOWAS. I shared with the President our conversation. I assured him the United States will work closely with ECOWAS and the United Nations to maintain the cease-fire and to enable a peaceful transfer of power. We are also pressing forward to help end Africa's long-running civil war in Sudan. My Special Envoy, Senator Jack Danforth, is returning to the region. We are making progress there. And his message is that there is only one option, and that is going to be peace. And his efforts are making good progress. ENTITY also discussed our action to combat HIV/AIDS. South Africa has recently increased its budget to fight the disease, and we noticed and we appreciate that. America is now undertaking a major new effort to help governments and private groups combat AIDS. Over the next 5 years, we will spend $15 billion in the global fight against AIDS. People across Africa had the will to fight this disease but often not the resources, and the United States of America is willing to put up the resources to help in the fight. We are committed to helping the people of Africa defeat hunger. We provided more than 500,000 metric tons of food aid to southern Africa over the past 18 months. This year we will provide nearly $1 billion to address food emergencies. We care when we see people who are hungry. We look forward to working with ENTITY to alleviate suffering. We are also working to expand trade, which I believe is the key to Africa's economic future. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is creating jobs and stimulating investment across the continent. Right here in South Africa, exports to the United States under AGOA have increased by 45 percent in the last year alone-significant progress. We are working with five nations of the Southern African Customs Union on a free trade agreement to help expand the circle of prosperity even wider. ENTITY, our countries have many common interests. We also share a fundamental commitment to the spread of peace and human rights and liberty. By working in close partnership, we are serving both the interests of the people of South Africa and the United States. I want to thank you for your friendship, appreciate the hospitality. It is been a great honor to be in your country. Thank you very much, ENTITY. I understand that two U.S. journalists and two South African journalists will pose some questions. Thank you, ENTITY. I'd like to direct the question to both Presidents, and it does concern the issue of HIV/AIDS and the $15 billion grant. Did you manage to reach some kind of understanding or consensus on the issue of how South Africa will access that money, on what terms South Africa will be able to access that money? And ENTITY, did you give any undertakings in terms of using your influence to ensure that there will be cheaper access-access to cheaper drugs and medicines? And to ENTITY, sir, did you-- How many questions-- Yes, I was going to say- . This is the last part. This is the ultimate five-part question. Did you give any undertaking in terms of the running out of the national treatment plan? Thank you. Well, as ENTITY had indicated, we did indeed discuss this. The situation is that we received a request from the U.S. Government to say, can we make proposals as to how to access the fund, for what purposes-a program, a program that we would present. So we are working on that. We want to respond to that request from the United States Government as quickly as is possible. We will do that and convey it. So it will be out of that process of discussion that will result, out of that proposal between the U.S. Government and ourselves, that then will come a program, a particular concrete kind of action, with the necessary costing when we get to that stage. So that is where we are. So the matter will be discussed in that way. And ENTITY had indicated in our discussions that of course the U.S. Government is taking a comprehensive approach to this, which would, therefore, include questions of awareness, questions of health infrastructure, questions of treatment, and so on. So we will look at the totality of those and-in the proposal that we would make. We just named Tobias to be the Ambassador, nominated him to be the Ambassador, and he is -upon confirmation-will be working with the countries such as South Africa to develop a strategy-is what we need. We need a commonsense strategy to make sure that the money is well-spent. And the definition of well-spent means lives are saved, which means good treatment programs, good prevention programs, good programs to develop health infrastructures in remote parts of different countries so that we can actually get antiretroviral drugs to those who need help. The cost of antiretroviral drugs has dropped substantially. But we did talk about the pharmaceutical union in a broader context. As you may know, the United States supported a moratorium on the enforcement of patent laws concerning those drugs related to diseases that were causing pandemics. And we will continue to work with South Africa as well as other countries to see if we cannot reach a commonsense policy that, on the one hand, protects intellectual property rights and, on the other hand, makes, you know, lifesaving drugs or treatment drugs for, in some cases, lifesaving, in some cases that are proper for treatment, more widely available at reasonable costs. But one reason I felt emboldened to ask the Congress for a substantial amount of new money for the AIDS Initiative was because of the cost of antiretrovirals, and it is significantly lower than it was a couple of years ago. So we are making good progress. And I look forward to working with ENTITY on putting together a sound strategy that saves lives. That is what our country is interested in. We are interested in dealing with this pandemic in a practical way. ENTITY . But whatever you do, do not fall into that bad habit of asking both of us three or four questions. How about keeping it to one. ENTITY, you have an assessment team in Liberia now to help you decide whether to send in U.S. troops as part of a peacekeeping effort. Right. U.S. troops are getting shot at increasingly in Iraq every day. We have troops in Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Korea. What do you say to critics who suggest that our forces may be spread too thinly now to engage in further initiatives? And to ENTITY, do you think that the United States should play a more active role in peacekeeping, specifically in Liberia? Well, first, my answer to people is that we will not overextend our troops, period. Secondly, we have made a commitment that we will work closely with the United Nations and ECOWAS to enforce the cease-fire, see to it that Mr. Taylor leaves office, so that there can be a peaceful transition in Liberia. We have made that commitment. I have said it clearly more than one time, like yesterday in Senegal, for example. So nothing has changed from about 12 hours ago on that question. We do have assessment teams there to assess what is necessary to help with the transition. And ENTITY brought up the question, and he can answer it his own way. But he asked whether or not we'd be involved, and I said, Yes, we will be involved. And we are now determining the extent of our involvement. Yes, certainly, we discussed this question with ENTITY many years ago and agreed that it is critically important that we as Africans should, indeed, take responsibility for the future of peace and stability on the continent. So that is a principal obligation that falls on us as Africans. So as you would know, the West African states, ECOWAS, have agreed to send in troops into Liberia. And they are trying to move that process forward as quickly as is possible. We appreciate very much the point that was made by ENTITY of the commitment of the United States to lend sup-port-the assessment teams are there to assess that-to lend support to those processes, processes of restoration of peace, making sure people do not starve, making sure that there is a restoration of democracy in Liberia. So the U.S. will cooperate with the African troops that will go there. So it is not- we are not saying that this is a burden that just falls on the United States. It really ought to principally fall on us as Africans. Of course, we need a lot of support, logistics-wise and so on, to do that, but the will is there. Just one quick followup on that-violating of the one-answer policy. I think our money has helped train seven battalions of peacekeepers amongst African troops. And it is a sensible policy for us to continue that training mission, so that we never do get overextended. And so one of the things you will see us do is invigorate this-reinvigorate the strategy of helping people help themselves by providing training opportunities. I think we have trained five Nigerian battalions, if I am not mistaken, one Senegalese. So we have got-but it is in our interest that we continue that strategy, Tom, so that we do not ever get overextended. Thanks. During the past week, the two Presidents or the Governments of-the Government of the U.S. and South Africa have expressed sharp differences about the best way to deal with the Zimbabwean question. Yes. And having met this morning, I wonder if the two Presidents have found the best approach or have agreed about the best approach to deal with Zimbabwe. I see that it has come up. Can we get from the smiles that you now have a formula to deal best with Zimbabwe? I did not know, ENTITY, that we'd expressed sharp differences. That is right. No. We are absolutely of one mind, the two Governments and ENTITY and myself are absolutely of one mind about the urgent need to address the political and economic challenges of Zimbabwe. It is necessary to resolve this matter as quickly as is possible. We have said, as you would know, for a long time that the principle is rooted- principal responsibility for the resolution of these problems rests with the people of Zimbabwe and, therefore, have urged them-both the ruling party and the opposition, the Government and the opposition-to get together and seriously tackle all of these issues. I did tell ENTITY that, indeed, the Government-ZANU-PF and the MDC are indeed discussing. They are engaged in discussions on all of the matters that would be relevant to the resolution of these political and economic problems. So that process is going on. We have communicated the message to both sides that-indeed, as we agreed with ENTITY-that it is very, very important that they should move forward with urgency to find a resolution to these questions. Of course, again, as ENTITY was saying, that apart from these important political issues about democrats and so on, you actually have ordinary people who are hungry in an economy which cannot cope with them, and you cannot allow that kind of situation to go on forever. So they are discussing. We had discussed this matter earlier, sometime back, with the U.S. Government that we have to find-we have got to find a way of getting a political solution, and we would indeed count very much on such economic, financial support as would come from the United States afterwards, in order to address the urgent challenges that face Zimbabwe. So we did not fight about any of what I have just said. We were smiling because we were certain a clever reporter would try to use the Zimbabwe issue as a way to maybe create tensions which do not exist. Look, Zimbabwe is an important country for the economic health of Africa. A free, peaceful Zimbabwe has got the capacity to deliver a lot of goods and services which are needed on this continent in order to help relieve suffering. And it is a very sad situation that is taken place in that country. Look, we share the same objective. ENTITY is the person most involved. He represents a mighty country in the neighborhood who is , because of his position and his responsibility, is working the issue. And I am not-not any intention of second-guessing his tactics. We share the same outcome. And I think it is important for the United States, whether it be me or my Secretary of State, to speak out when we see a situation where somebody's freedoms have been taken away from them and they are suffering. And that is what we are going to continue to do. ENTITY is the point man on this important subject. He is working it very hard. He is in touch with the parties involved. He is-he is making-he believes, making good progress. And the United States supports him in this effort. Last question. ENTITY. : Yes, ENTITY. Do you regret that your State of the Union accusation that Iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials in Africa is now fueling charges that you and Prime Minister Blair misled the public? And then, secondly, following up on Zimbabwe, are you willing to have a representative meet with a representative of the Zimbabwe opposition leader, who sent a delegation here and complained that he did not think ENTITY could be an honest broker in the process? Well, I think ENTITY can be an honest broker, to answer the second question. The first question is-look, there is no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the world peace. And there is no doubt in my mind the United States, along with allies and friends, did the right thing in removing him from power. And there is no doubt in my mind, when it is all said and done, the facts will show the world the truth. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind. And so there is going to be a lot of, you know, attempts to try to rewrite history, and I can understand that. But I am absolutely confident in the decision I made. Do you still believe they were trying to buy nuclear materials in Africa? Right now? No, were they? I mean, the statement you made-- One thing is for certain, he is not trying to buy anything right now. If he is alive, he is on the run. And that is to the benefit of the Iraqi people. But look, I am confident that Saddam Hussein had a weapons of mass destruction program. In 1991, I will remind you, we underestimated how close he was to having a nuclear weapon. Imagine a world in which this tyrant had a nuclear weapon. In 1998, my predecessor raided Iraq based upon the very same intelligence. And in 2003, after the world had demanded he disarm, we decided to disarm him. And I am convinced the world is a much more peaceful and secure place as a result of the actions. Thank you all very much. Thanks a lot.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconferencewithpresidentthabombekisouthafricapretoriasouth", "title": "The President's News Conference With President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa in Pretoria, South Africa", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-thabo-mbeki-south-africa-pretoria-south", "publication_date": "09-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 233, "text": "Good afternoon, ENTITY. How are you? I am great. It is nice to talk to you again. I cannot hear. Can you hear me now? I can hear you. Can you hear me? ENTITY, I can now. How are you? We have not talked since very late in the campaign. You were in an automobile someplace, and you were running out of voice. But you were in high spirits, and now we know why. Congratulations. Thank you very much. It is nice to hear your voice again. Nice to hear you. I got to hear a little bit of your last conversation. That was fascinating. With Bob Talbert? Yes. ENTITY, are you going to get your tax bill and your budget bill through the Senate? Carl Levin is on this program a little bit later. We have already taped that segment. He says, Yes, it will be done. What do you think? I think it will be done. It is not easy ever to make these kinds of tough decisions. There are $250 billion in budget cuts in that bill that affect everything from agriculture to veterans, to Medicare, to virtually all the specific programs in the Government. And there are some tax increases, as is well-known, two-thirds of them on people with incomes above $200,000, three-quarters of them on people with incomes above $100,000. I think it is fair and balanced. And this will bring the deficit down by $500 billion, and it will keep these long-term interest rates coming down, which is what is so necessary if we are going to have reinvestment in our country and rebuild the manufacturing sector and get this economy going again. I think it will pass because, frankly, there is not another alternative. And those who have tried to fashion other alternatives have come up with programs that hurt the vulnerable in our country and the middle class more and hurt the business economy more. And I think that is why we have had people from companies representing the automakers to high-tech companies in California supporting the program. It is a little-known thing that over half the 100 biggest companies in the country have supported the program, that the labor organizations have supported it, that the home builders organization, a largely Republican group, have supported it because it will bring interest rates down and create jobs and incomes for the American people. But if it does pass the Senate, and apparently Senator Levin feels you have enough votes, 50 or more votes, it has to go back to the House. It is been changed significantly from the bill approved by the House. We hear the Black Caucus may be falling out of step. Can it pass the entire Congress? I think it can. I think what you will see is, when the bill passes the Senate, if we can pass it in the next few days, then there will be a conference of the Senators and the House Members. And they will try to take the best parts of both bills and come up with a bill which has more budget cuts than taxes, fair taxes, but still has some of the incentives we need for small business job creation, for the high-tech job creation, for empowerment zones to get private sector investment into the urban areas and to the poor rural areas, and also some of the money for Head Start education and training and for joint projects with the private sector for new technologies to help to deal with the defense cuts. I think you will see that budget coming out of there. And I expect it to pass both Houses. Like I said, these are difficult times, because for 12 years the American people have been told one thing and had another thing happen where the debt just kept getting bigger and bigger, and it is eating us alive. And interest rates were high, and we could not get investment. We could not get jobs. We are going to turn it around, but it is not easy. A couple of things started to leak out this weekend on those weekend Washington shows. One item was that entertainers and sports people, people who make big salaries for usually a relatively short period of time, would be exempt from the new higher rate of income tax. Is that true? Not to my knowledge. Apparently it was on Face the Nation or one of those shows yesterday. Not so? No. There are not any exemptions. I think what you are going to find is that people who make a lot of money for just a couple of years may wind up doing something that many of them already do, by the way, which is structuring their contracts so they get paid over a longer period of years than they play. That is something that is happening now and that may happen. But I know of no exemptions for any high income people. And the surtax on the capital gains tax, everyone was figuring maybe there will be a capital gains cut. Maybe that will be a tradeoff, higher income tax rates, lower capital gains. Will there be a surtax on capital gains? It is hard to say. That is in the Senate bill. But I am not sure how it will come out in the end. I think one thing you can look forward to is a so-called venture capital gains on new business capital gains tax, where people who put their money into new businesses will be given big incentives to do so. That is, if you take a risk on somebody and you start a new venture and you hire some new people to create new jobs in the economy and you hold that investment for 5 years or more, you will be able to reduce your tax liability if, in fact, it turns out to be successful. We have to have more people trying to start new businesses. And that is a more hazardous undertaking. So I think you will see that. Will there be some incentives for new business? Because I heard from- Absolutely. I asked this morning in my morning show-I mentioned, of course, that I would be talking to you. And I said, Give me some questions that you'd like me to ask ENTITY And I heard from several small business people. They said something like this: Look, I wanted to open two new businesses this year -this was a fellow who was in the fast-food franchise business, but he said, With all that is going on relative to the proposed new legislation on taxes, I am afraid to build any more restaurants. Small businesses are getting hurt. I heard that over and over this morning. Let me just mention two or three things that should be reassuring to small businesses. If these provisions of my plan pass, first of all, anybody who starts a new venture will be able to get investment for that new venture. And if the investment is held for 5 years or more, the tax rates will be much, much lower than the ordinary income tax rates, if it passes. Secondly, for ongoing small businesses, today the write-off for expensing on the tax form is $10,000 per year. We propose to raise that to $25,000. That will be a substantial reduction in the tax burden of most small businesses and will be an encouragement, I think, for them to hire more people. Thirdly, if someone has a chain of restaurants, for example, like the person who called in, in the plan that I presented to the Congress that the House of Representatives adopted, we have some changes in the alternative minimum tax provisions which operate as real incentives for people to continue to invest their profits in the expansion of their businesses without running up bigger tax bills. So I would urge the small business people who are listening to us to really look at what is in that House bill. There are a lot of very strong pro-business and pro-small business provisions in the bill that have not gotten a lot of attention. That is why, let me just mention, the National Realtors Association and the National Home Builders Association, two groups not normally associated with the Democratic Party, have already strongly endorsed this economic program because of the incentives for economic growth and because it is bringing down long-term interest rates. That is the last thing I will say. Any business person who has to borrow money in all probability is going to save more money in lower-interest rates than they will pay in higher taxes. ENTITY, one of the thrusts of your campaign was jobs. There would be more jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs would be created. If the business climate is not good, if there is not an opportunity for businesses to do well, to be successful, there will be fewer jobs. I mean, that is just simple economics, is not it? That is right, but simple economics dictate that the ENTITY stop telling everybody what they want to hear and start telling the truth. That is what simple economics dictate. I mean, in 1981 we cut taxes and increased spending and nearly bankrupted this country over the next 12 years, and we have been paying for it ever since, so that we had very high long-term interest rates, and credit was expensive, and job generation was weak. That is a problem, by the way, for wealthy countries throughout the world. Even Japan's having trouble creating jobs now. But look what is happened since I announced my plan and it started to pass its way through Congress, just in the last 4 or 5 months. First, we have had 755,000 new jobs in this economy, over 90 percent of them in the private sector, in the first 4 months of this administration. In the previous 4 years, we only had a million jobs. Second, in construction, part of the economy very affected by interest rates, in the first 4 months we had 130,000 new jobs, that is the biggest increase in 9 years. Has that affected every State and every community yet? No, but it shows that we are really moving in the right direction. If we can get everybody in this country to refinance their home loans, their business loans, to take available credit because interest rates are lower, that will put tens of billions of dollars back into this economy to create jobs. What inflation rate, sir-I do not mean to interrupt you, but we are short on time-what inflation rate would you be happy with one year from now? The lowest possible one. But if we got unemployment down to a very low level and every American had a job, it might be a tad higher than it is now, but right now we think we are in good shape on inflation. What we need in America are more jobs and higher incomes, and that is what we are working on. So, this is a job-creating strategy we are following, and I believe it will work. How is David Gergen doing in his new job? He is doing very well. He is a good man. We have been friends a long time and- Is the Washington press corps still braying at the moon, sir? I do not even know how to answer that. The moon still comes out here, though, at night, and the sun comes up in the morning. ENTITY, a pleasure to talk to you today. Thank you very much for spending the time. I hope you get a chance to visit us. Me too.

{"id": 487, "text": "First of all, we would like to thank you very much for your readiness to see us and to have this interview for us. We can assure you that in Israel, you can be elected for the third term with one exception: The day after the first day in office, the media will kill you. This is Israel. But you have so many, really, admirers in Israel. Well, thank you. I am really looking forward to going again. As you know, this is my first trip as ENTITY. I had the honor I saw you. I had the opportunity to shake your hand in the Knesset. I was thrilled to go in 1998. One of the great ironies of my first trip to Israel was that, as well documented, I was given a tour of the West Bank by Ariel Sharon. Little did we both realize then that we would be sitting together in the hopes of constructing peace, that we knew we'd be we did not know that we'd be ENTITY and Prime Minister at the time. And yet he was the leader of the opposition at the time. Well, he was in the Cabinet. He was a settlements man. And we were flying, and it was a very interesting moment. And I can remember so well Prime Minister Sharon pointing to a hill, and he said, This is where I engaged as a young tank officer, my first battle, and see how far it is to our capital and our civilization. In other words, it was his purpose was to make it clear to me the strategic issues facing Israel. And then we flew over the West Bank, and it was a fascinating moment. And it was history works in odd ways, and sometimes you are never sure about the twists and turns that life will bring. And so I am looking forward to meeting with the Sharon family and express my admiration for a man with whom I was able to Two years from today he had his stroke. Yes, 2 years to this day. Today, today. Anyway, it will be an interesting moment for me, to express my sympathies to his family. He was an interesting man, and anyway, I am looking forward to going to see the current leadership in Israel as well as the Palestinians and the Arab region. 's Upcoming Visit to Israel Could we ask could we start asking questions? Please, yes. Your visit to Israel, what is the vision you would like to convey to the Israeli public? The vision is, one, that I fully understand that the world is confronting extremists the world must confront extremists who want to impose their ideology on peaceful people by the use of terror; and that we are engaged in an ideological struggle that requires resolve and vision; and that the best way to defeat the ideology of hate is with an ideology of hope, and that is manifested in a society based upon liberty; that the two-state solution is in Israel's long-term security interests, and that there is hard work to be done by the leaders of the Palestinians and the Israelis. I will also assure Israel that there is no way that a Israeli democracy can accept a terrorist state on her border; that there is a way and I am optimistic that there are enough Palestinians committed to a state based upon liberty that we can achieve that they can achieve, with U.S. help, the vision of two states side by side in peace. Mr. ENTITY. , the Israeli people are worried, first and foremost, because of the danger that Iran will acquire nuclear weapons. Can you, Mr. ENTITY. , assure the Israelis that such a danger will never occur under your watch? Well, I can assure the people of Israel and others in the Middle East that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be a danger to world peace. I have said so very explicitly. I believe that the and I believe we have put in place a system that encourages pressure on the Iranians to come up with to either have a choice between isolation and financial difficulty or a rational approach to what they claim is their sovereign right, which is the ability to have nuclear power. Now, they have been untrustworthy; they have been unwilling to be transparent and open. And so our demands are to the Iranians, not only with our voice, but the voice of the international community thus far, is, you must be transparent; you must be open; and you because of your failure to report programs, that you cannot be trusted with the ability to learn how to enrich. And so my message to the Israeli people is, I fully understand the threat, that we spend a lot of time on this issue, and that we will continue to exert maximum pressure through the international community to peacefully resolve this issue. I am sure you have heard the report by the American intelligence Yes, I have. Unfortunately for us, we followed it too. How it affected the chances to stop Iran from becoming a danger? Actually, if you study the report carefully, it basically said not basically it said that Iran had a secret program In the year 2003. Right. But my message to the American people was is that a nontransparent society that had a program could easily have another program. And therefore, the intensity of the effort must not decline, but must stay strong and the intensity of the effort being to prevent them from developing the know-how. Secondly, there are three stages to the development of a nuclear weapon: one, materials out of which to make a weapon that is why we have got to stop them from enriching, and that is where our focus is; two, the ability to take materials and to make it into a warhead or a bomb and we do not know their capacities at this point in time, but it is fairly general knowledge on how to produce a weapon out of materials; and three, rockets. Well, two of the three continue to exist. And therefore, to say a weapons program does not exist is not the complete truth. And so our focus is to prevent the one thing over which we believe the international community can have influence, which is to stop the capacity to enrich. Thirdly, the report did say that as a result of pressures, the Iranians suspended their military program. Well, if pressures worked in the past, my hope is that pressures will work in the future. Part of the reason I am going to the Middle East is to make it abundantly clear to nations in that part of the world that we view Iran as a threat, and that the NIE in no way lessens that threat, but in fact, clarifies the threat. If Israel comes with a smoking gun during the year 2008, are you going to back an Israeli operation military operation? My message to all in the region is, I believe we can solve this diplomatically and that pressure must work. I have said, of course, that the United States keeps all options on the table. That is the United States policy. And that but I believe the best solution is going to be one that encourages Iranian isolation through international pressures that will cause the Iranians to have to make a strategic choice. Now, people say: Well, what do you mean by that? What kind of pressures? Well, there are financial pressures that we have exerted and will continue to work with others to exert. Now, look, I readily recognize that one of the real challenges is to convince people that peace is more important than market share, that achieving long-term peace in the Middle East is more important than someone's companies having a share of equipment American or Well, I am saying any company. Of course, American companies are not involved with the exportation of goods and services to Iran. Therefore, in this case, I mean, the logic would say that extends to not only European countries but countries from around the world. Same with financial institutions, that we expect there to be significant pressure placed upon Iranian financial institutions, particularly those that are known to be involved in proliferation. And so the strategy is more than just words; it is an action-oriented strategy, aimed at convincing people inside of Iran that there is a better way forward. If you look at my speeches or listen to my speeches, you will notice that I constantly speak to the Iranian people and make it clear to them that the isolation that they are now suffering and the economic deprivation that is occurring as a result of isolation is a result of their Government's decisions. Our beef is not with the Iranian people, our beef is with a Government that has hidden the program. And by the way, back to the NIE very quickly. The international response ought to be that, okay, whether or not you agree with the NIE or not, at least recognize that they had a program at one point in time, and demand that Iran explain it. We should not be trying to explain why we know what we know. We ought to be focusing on the Iranians to say, you tell us why you had a program; you tell us about the if you want to be an international player, it is up to you to explain. Mr. ENTITY. , I will try to put the question another way. If the Israeli Prime Minister will present you with a smoking gun and will tell you, look, we cannot live with such a threat, and we will destroy the Iranian nuclear sites, you will support Israel? You will give Israel you will let Israel to do so? The policy of the United States is to solve this diplomatically. You know, Israel is Israeli people are confused regarding our own Government. There is now a big discussion in Israel regarding the blunders of the second Lebanon war. And at the same time, you are familiar with the September 6th whatever happens there, we do not know; I am sure you know. Can you tell us what is your impression of the, I would say, of the way the Israeli Government is handling our own military? I can only tell you about my personal relationship with Prime Minister Olmert. That is the person with whom I have spent the most time. I, of course, see the Foreign Minister or the Defense Minister at meetings, but my time is spent with Prime Minister Olmert. I trust him, I like him, and I think he is a man of strength. Prime Minister Olmert, first of all, one thing I look for is, I look for vision. Can somebody see a hopeful future? A lot of times in the this complicated world in which we live, we stay so focused on the moment that it is hard to see a vision that reaches beyond the immediate. And so when I talk to Prime Minister Olmert, I listen very carefully about his vision for the future because what we are talking about at Annapolis is vision, is giving people something to be for, something to hope for. The whole purpose of our discussions at Annapolis has been to advance what a state would look like. The state is subject to the roadmap, the obligations of both sides before the state can come into being; it is subject to the roadmap. But there is got to be a vision because a vision is inspirational, a vision is hopeful. There is got to be something that the Palestinians can say, if Here is what we are for. Therefore, let us renounce our desire to destroy Israel; let us recognize that it must exist as a neighbor. So support us. I believe there is enough people in the Palestinian Territories who are sick of the failures of the past, sick of broken promise. And yet they have yet to have something specifically defined around which they can rally. That is the purpose. And so when I talk to Prime Minister Olmert, I listen very carefully to whether or not he is able to think beyond the moment. And I have come to the conclusion that, yes, he is a man of vision. He understands the significance of defining a hopeful state. And it is hopeful not just for the Palestinians, but it is hopeful for Israel as well. After all, he ran on a platform that said now, this is a major shift in Israeli policy; it started with Ariel Sharon, as you know which is two states, based upon the premise that liberty will bring peace. Now, of course, his concern is that the imposition of a state before certain conditions have been met that is why I say, subject to the roadmap. And the United States, as I said early, recognizes that there cannot be a state that harbors the desire to destroy its neighbor. No government can accept that, and I understand that. And so I trust Olmert. His Do you? I do trust him. You trust Olmert, period? I trust him. I hope hopefully, he will say the same about me. Hopefully you see, one of the things in politics that happens often is, people sometimes will not tell you really what is on their mind. It happens here in America. For example, you will have politicians walk in the Oval Office and say, Hey, ENTITY. , I am with you. And then all of a sudden, the heat gets on and it turns out, they are not with you. You feel it at your back. Yes. Well, I feel and I have had enough conversations, heart-to-heart conversations with the Prime Minister. I understand Israeli politics is very complicated. It is tough. It is full-contact karate. And Not unlike American Not really. Not really. Because the ENTITY. is even though we have got our politics and even though I have got tough relations at times with Congress, the ENTITY. sets foreign policy. He is constantly worried about a coalition. And I understand that. I understand the difficulty he faces. But in spite of those difficulties, I am interested in strategic visions based upon peace. And I firmly believe he has that vision. And obviously, he is going to have to work his way through the Israeli politics, and he is going to have to be mindful of what is happening elsewhere. And the United States, by the way, can help both parties. That is why I am going, to help boost the confidence of both parties to reach out for a vision. And by the way, the trip is more than just going to Israel and the Palestinian Territories. I am also going to the Arab world for two reasons. One is to convince the Arab nations that Israel is a partner should be a partner in peace; that this vision is in the interests not only of Israel and Palestinians, but it is in the interests of the Arab world. You expect to achieve something tangible? Well, we achieved something very tangible. Look, you got to understand that in a matter as complicated as this issue, that it requires a lot of diligence and a lot of time and a lot of effort. There was a major breakthrough at Annapolis when the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian ENTITY. addressed a roomful of diplomats, high-ranking officials from the Middle East, as well as the rest of the world. And so now we must follow up on that success. In other words, they were in the room listening very carefully to the visions of both nations. And the American ENTITY. can help move the process forward by reminding friends and allies in the Middle East about the importance of the two-state solution and what they can do to help. And the third thing, of course, is to spend time talking about the strategic implications of a U.S. presence in a way that bolsters governments and, at the same time, helps serve as a bulwark against aggressive regimes such as Iran. And so it is a multifaceted agenda that I am really looking forward to carrying on there in the Middle East. But still, Mr. ENTITY. , do you see a chance to sign a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Yes, I do, before I leave. Before you leave? Yes, I do. I do. I am an optimistic guy. by initials or by full execution? Well, first of all no. First of all, the I envision Israel and Palestine sitting down at a table, signing this is what a state would look like, subject to the roadmap. There is work to be done. And concluding an agreement? On what the state would look like, absolutely. Yes, I do. I think it can happen. And I believe both parties want it to happen. Now, they got work to do, and one of the reasons I am going is to remind them of the work they got to do. See, people say to me, All you got to do is go over there and say impose the solution. No, we want the solution to last. This has got to be negotiated in good faith, and it is hard work. Both leaders have got constituencies they have got to deal with, skeptical publics. And I believe the U.S. ENTITY. can help keep the process moving, and that is what my trip is all about. Unauthorized settlement, it is something which an issue which is between the United States and Israel for a long time. Yes, we expect them to honor their commitments. The Israeli Government has said that they are going to get rid of unauthorized settlements, and that is what we expect. That is what we have been told. Not before you come, you know. Well, that will be on the that will, of course, be an agenda item. But Prime Minister both Prime Ministers with whom I have worked understand our position. Both have agreed, by the way, of unauthorized settlements. They agree? Both understand, as well, that I said conditions on the ground, the realities of the situation will help determine what a the borders look like. And so I have made some at least from what the U.S. perspective looks like some statements that will help move the process forward. But the unauthorized settlements, which is different from authorized settlements, is an issue we have been very clear on. But I have also made statements on the settlements as well. As I said, realities on the ground will help define the border the eventual border of what the Palestinian state will look like. And the state will come into being subject to the conditions set out in the roadmap, which means we have got a lot of work to do. One of the things I will be doing is visiting with Tony Blair there in order to make to catch up on what he is doing to help the Palestinians. Look, developing a state out of is difficult. There is got to be institutions that provide stability, and it is hard to do. That is what happening in IraIt is hard to go from dictatorship, like they had in Iraq, to one in which there is solid institutions that will enable a democracy to survive. I have come to the conclusion that it is absolutely necessary work for the sake of peace because if we are in an ideological struggle, the only way to defeat the ideology that preys upon fear and hate is through the development of societies that respond to the will of the people. And democracies it turns out, democracies throughout our history tend not to fight each other because democracies respond to the will of the people, and most people do not want war and bloodshed and violence. Most people just want to live a normal, peaceful life. I tell the American people all the time that Iraqi mothers want the same thing for their children that American mothers want for theirs, a place for their child to grow up and get a good education and be able to realize dreams. Same thing for the Palestinian mothers and the Israeli mothers. There is a commonality there, and yet, unfortunately, in the world in which we live today, there are people who simply do not like the idea of societies based upon the will of the people and will use violence to stop the advance of freedom. And it is not just in the Palestinian Territories that you find the violence, you find it in Lebanon, you find it in Iraq, you find it in Afghanistan, you find it in Pakistan. You find it in Gaza. Yes. You find people who will kill innocent life to stop the advance of freedom, which should call the world to should cause the world to rally. If killers want to stop liberty, it should be a clear signal to all of us that we must do everything we can to advance liberty. And one of the things I find very hopeful about a Palestinian state is that many in the world want to help the Palestinians develop institutions and stability. And I ENTITY. Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are committed to the development of a state. They need a lot of help. And one of the things we can provide help for besides some practical help on organizing their security forces and obviously to encourage investment is to there is got to be a vision, see. People have got to be for something. And that is where we are trying to take the process over the next year. Mr. ENTITY. , you just mentioned IraCan you clarify to us whether there was any Israeli involvement in your decision to invade Iraq? No, not at all, none whatsoever. My decision was based upon U.S. intelligence, based upon the desire to provide security for our peoples and others. It was based upon my willingness to work with the international community on this issue. Remember, if you look back at the history, there was a unanimous vote in the Security Council: disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. And when he defied, when he refused to allow the inspectors in, when he made a statement by his actions that he did not really care what the international community said, that I decided to make sure words meant something. And so I acted based upon our own security interests. And but it also fit into this notion of and remember, Zarqawi there was some terrorist connections, not with the 9/11 attacks, but terrorist connections. Abu Nidal, he had been using he'd been funding families of suicide bombers. In other words, as far as we were concerned, he had weapons of mass destruction, which could have been used in a deadly way. It turns out, he did not have the weapons, but he had the know-how on how to make weapons, which could easily have been reconstituted. The sanctions regime turns out to have been corrupt and was not working. In other words, there is a variety of aspects to my decision, all of which were aimed at making sure that U.S. security, first and foremost, was enhanced. National Security Council Press Secretary Gordon Johndroe. One last question. You follow the primaries now, in America. Yes. We wonder if there is a moment when you tell yourself, wow, why cannot I join the fray? That is interesting. I can do it better. No, no, I appreciate that question. It is a very interesting question. I believe strongly that democracies are enhanced by change by the peaceful change of government. And as much as I will miss being ENTITY. and there will be a lot of aspects I will miss about it it is in our Nation's interests that there be a healthy debate and that the process move on. And so I am realistic about what is going to happen this year. You know, I loved campaigning. We were reminiscing at the ranch this weekend Laura and I and some friends were about how exciting ENTITY. ial campaigns can be. And I also understand how grueling they can be. This is a time of high anxiety for campaigns and candidates as they come in the final day of the Iowa caucuses. I can remember distinctly what it felt like campaigning in these States In the snow. in the snow on the last day. And so there is a lot of excitement to it. But I am very comfortable about this year. We have got a lot to do. We have got a lot to do domestically and a lot to do internationally. I fully understand there is going to be a lot of focus on the ENTITY. ial primaries and the ENTITY. ial general election, which is good. There ought to be a healthy debate. In the meantime, however, I am not going to allow domestic politics to get in the way of implementing a vision, of doing laying that foundation for peace, one of the things history will look back on. When you are talking about vision, Mr. ENTITY. and this will be our last question how do you wish to be remembered in world history? Well, first of all, I will be dead before the true history of the Bush administration is written. Here in the Oval Office, there are portraits of two ENTITY. s, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. In the past couple of years, I have read extensive analyses of both of those men's Presidencies. My attitude is that it is going to take a while for objective historians to realize the contributions that this administration has made to peace. Like Harry Truman's legacy, which developed. Well, each ENTITY. has his own set of circumstances with which to deal. I would hope that people, when they look back at this administration, would say that ENTITY. Bush and his administration worked diligently to protect the American people from harm; that he recognized the threats of the 21st century; that he acted in a when he needed to be tough, he acted strong, and when he needed to have vision, he understood the power of freedom to be transformative. Our foreign policy is more than just confronting terrorists. Our foreign policy is to confront the conditions that enable these ideologues to recruit, such as HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa or feeding the hungry or dealing with malaria. Our foreign policy is based upon our great trust in the capacity of the common person to dictate a peaceful course for government. But just so you know, I fully understand I will be long gone before the accurate history of this administration is reflected in the history books. In our country, you will not have to wait so long. Well, I do not worry about it, sir. I just really do not . It is such an honor to be You betray the office if you get so caught up in your own per-sonal your personal standing. I remind people that the ENTITY. should must understand, like in the Middle East, that the conditions must be ripe for people to go for peace and that you cannot force peace based upon a ENTITY. 's calendar. You can use the calendar by saying to the parties, you know this guy, you know his vision; now is the time for you to come to conclusion. But a ENTITY. must never try to force others to accept something that they themselves do not want to accept because there will be it will not last. Now, we can work hard, and I believe the time is ripe; that is what I am trying to say to you. We have got leaders who have made commitments to a vision. They have both told me and told each other, we are committed. And these men know me. And so I believe to answer your question yes, there will be a comprehensive peace signed by the end of this year, because if they are committed, like they say they are and I believe they are, and I believe their people, the majority of the people want there to be peace now is the time to move. Anyway.

{"id": 501, "text": "ENTITY, good evening. The relations between France and the United States for a long time had cooled down for quite some time, for about 3 years, since the intervention in Iraq and since the opposition of three major countries: Russia, Germany, and France. And this quote was lent to your administration, whereby we should forgive Russia, forget Germany, and punish France and France was punished for its rebelliousness. And number two, is the punishment over? First of all, I never really felt that a disagreement over Iraq should yield a rupture in relations. I fully understand why people disagree with my decision, and so I never really subscribed to that theory. So there is no punishment, really, in my from my perspective. Secondly, I value the relationship a lot. And the United States and France have had a long history. After all, much of our independence was achieved as a result of the aid of the French. And we have been through wars together; we have had our agreements and our disagreements. So I have really worked hard to make sure the relationship was bigger than the individuals. Nicolas Sarkozy of France Has that changed the situation somewhat, given the fact that Mr. Sarkozy has replaced Mr. Chirac? Of course, in the sense that every individual matters. In other words, I have dealt with a lot of foreign leaders, and some and each person brings their own set of personalities and values. And President is a man of deep values. He is got a lot of energy. He is a lot of fun to be around. Plus, he is a serious man, and he wants to so he is like me; he wants to solve problems Here is a problem, let us go solve it. And so I am looking forward to visiting with him. The relationship is good, and I intend to work to keep it that way. With distance, do you think that the French arguments at the time whereby there were no weapons of mass destruction, which was proven; there is no direct relationship with the September 11th attacks. So do you think that these arguments were justified? So do not you regret it after all? No, I do not at all. Absolutely, getting rid of Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do. Now, first of all, nobody ever said that the September 11th attacks were ordered by Saddam. That is myth. That was never part of my argument. And secondly, I did go to the United Nations Security Council and 1441 was supported by the French which said, disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. You would not say that if you did not believe he had weapons of mass destruction. Now, in hindsight, he did not . Do I think the world is better off without him? Absolutely. I know Iraq is as well. And so my decision was the right decision. Again, I understand why people do not like the use of armed force. That is natural. On the other hand, the liberation of 25 million people is noble. And now the question is, will we work together to help this young democracy survive in the face of extremists and radicals who kill the innocent in order to achieve their political objectives? And I cannot thank President enough for sending the Foreign Minister to Baghdad, which basically said, we want to help you survive. We think democracy is a great alternative to the ideology of mass murderers. And that is the question we are faced with, those of us who live in the free world: Are we willing to help others realize the blessings of freedom for the sake of peace? But your father, during the first gulf war, had stopped at the doors of Baghdad. He left Saddam in sight, weakened, in power. So why did not you do the same thing as him? Did you speak with him? Did he tell you, son, you can do what I did not do 10 years ago? So ultimately, do not you wonder as to that may not be what actually destabilized the region ultimately? No. I think there is what we are witnessing is a great clash between radicals and extremists who murder and people who want to live in peace. And the situation was different in 1991 than it was in 2003. After all, the United States has been attacked, and I said that we are going to deal with threats before they fully materialize. It is one of the lessons of September the 11th. Saddam Hussein was given a chance to disclose or disarm. He chose not to. He was the one who, once again, defied the world. He is the one who basically said, I do not care what the United Nations said and what France and the United States and everybody else on the Security Council said. And so I am very comfortable with the decision I made. But you say, does this cause there to be radicalism that causes the murder of the causes people to lose their life? Absolutely not. What causes people to become radicals is when they become hopeless and frustrated and fall prey to the whims and desires of a bunch of ideologues who murder innocent people whether it be in Iraq today or in Afghanistan today or whether it be in Lebanon or whether it be in the Palestinian Territories all trying to stop the advent of democracy because they cannot stand the thought of free societies in their midst. And the challenge for those of us who live in free societies, like I said, and the challenge for President and George W. Bush and other leaders is, are we going to sit back and not care whether people live in freedom, or are we going to help them realize the blessings of liberty? Because liberty will yield the peace we want. So to a certain extent, you did contribute to giving greater power to Iran, because it no longer is facing its hated enemy on the other side. So now is there a true threat in Iran, and are you ready now to invade Iran as you did with Afghanistan and Iraq? So it is indeed true that Vice President is it true that Vice President Cheney has a plan for that? Gosh, I do not know where you are getting all these rumors there must be some weird things going on in Europe these days because I have made it abundantly clear, now is the time to deal with a true threat to world peace, that is Iran, and to do it diplomatically and peacefully. And that is what I am going to spend a lot of time on with President. But of course, we want to solve these problems peacefully. But if it does not work, if the sanctions and the threats do not work, what happens? Well, we are going to as I said, all options are on the table. But the objective is to make them work. I mean, I am not so sure I agree with your hypothesis that if they do not work. I am the kind of guy that says, let us make sure they do work. And that is what I intend to talk to President about and Angela Merkel about, and that is to keep the international pressure and to keep the focus on the ambitions of an Iranian regime that has publicly declared its intention to destroy Israel, for example, and have defied the demands of the IAEA. And so they are not trusted to be trusted with a enrichment program. We made that abundantly clear to them. And I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically. But to say that to enhance a free society on Iran's border strengthens the Iranians is just not true. I simply do not buy into that logic or illogic, in this case. I think a free society on Iran's border is going to be make their life more difficult. I think that, ultimately, they are going to feel pressure about the type of government they have when their people look across the border and see a flourishing, free society. And so our policy is to work with friends and allies to say to the people, here is a problem, let us work collaboratively to address it, and now, early. But in spite of all your efforts, the United States today have a worse image today than they had 7 years ago. People find Americans less likable pretty much everywhere in the world. Do you have your own share of responsibility, or is this inevitable because the United States is the most powerful country in the world? Look, first of all, I think most people respect America, and they like Americans. They may not necessarily like ENTITY And so but I have always been the kind of person, Patrick, to make decisions based upon what is right, as opposed to trying to be the popular guy. I have always found the person who strives for popularity In the past, we used to say that the American Dream was freedom, but today it seems to be repression, more self-focused society. Oh, no, that is absurd. That is absurd to say the American Dream is repression. Freedom is the absolute we are helping people achieve. That is think about what is happening with 25 million people in Iraq or 25 million people in Afghanistan or the fact that the United States is freeing people from the scourge of HIV/ AIDS. We are spending $30 billion, when Congress passes my budget, to help people on HIV/AIDS or the fact that we have got a $1.6 billion program to help people who are families who are suffering as a result of a child dying from malaria. In other words, we have got a very aggressive freedom agenda. And if you come to the United States, you will find that you can practice your religion any way you see fit, that this is an open society and a free society. And so yes, I understand people's the image may not be as good as one would like, but people respect what America stands for. They may not like the decisions I have made, but I do not see how you can be a leader if you worry about public opinion polls all the time, particularly in a world in which there is a lot of problems that require strong leadership. ENTITY's Legacy And what legacy, what record would you like to leave in history? You have spent 7 years in the White House. You will be leaving in a year. What would you like the memory, the souvenir of you to remain? Well, certainly the fact that 50 million people have been liberated; that we have got a very strong relationship in the Far East; that we are friends with China, Japan, and South Korea something that is been hard for other ENTITYs to do. I think we can help stand up a Palestinian state. I am the first ENTITY ever to have articulated a two-party state, two states side by side in peace. Our HIV/AIDS initiative is very strong. I mean, we are leading the world when it comes to helping feed the hungry or take care of those who are ill. I think our malaria initiative will go down in history as a great initiative. And at home, some of my education initiatives and the fact that our economy has grown, in spite of recession, corporate scandals, and war and the attack on America. See, I am a tax cutter. I believe when people have more money in their pockets, they do better. And so I am you know, it is an interesting thing about history. You are really not going to know the history of the Bush administration until long after you and I are dead. There is no such thing as accurate, short-term history. It takes a while for people to see the results of decisions having been made. And so I am very comfortable, Patrick. I feel comfortable that the decisions I have made have been in the best interests of the country. I have been comfortable that I have had to deal with some tough problems, and I did not shy away from the problems; I tackled them head on. And I love my country, and I love what we stand for. And last question, who would you like to see as your replacement in 1 year? A Republican? A Democrat? Of course a Republican. But I am not you are trying to get me to take sides. You prefer Republican. Absolutely, a Republican. A woman? An African American? A veteran? Do you have a choice? Are there any people that you like more than others? Now, see, you are trying to cleverly draw me into the race for the Presidency. And one of the things that I have told the American people is, I am going to watch the Republican primaries unfold and not take positions and then go out and help my party's nominee win. And I think we will win the White House. I think whoever will get nominated from our party will win, because the big issues in America are who is going to be tough in this war on terror and who is going to protect our homeland and will they keep taxes low. And our candidates will be willing to take those positions in a way that appeals to the American people. But anyway, nice try trying to get me to endorse a candidate. ENTITY's Vacation/France-U.S. Relations We saw a French President spend his summer vacations this year in the United States. So when will George W. Bush spend his vacations in France? Thank you very much. As you know, I am a I have got a piece of property I love in Texas It is large. very much, and when I do, I like to go down there. But I would love to come back to France. It is a beautiful country. I have had some really good experiences there, and I have found the people to be very friendly. And, look, I understand there is disagreements. But from my perspective, the people of France really do respect what America has stood for and respect our alliance. And I was greeted with great respect when I went there. And so I'd like to come back sometimes. And I am looking forward to my meeting with President. It is going to be a constructive meeting. Once again, thank you very much, ENTITY Thank you very much for hosting us. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You bet. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpatrickpoivredarvortf1televisionfrance", "title": "Interview With Patrick Poivre d'Arvor of TF1 Television of France", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-patrick-poivre-darvor-tf1-television-france", "publication_date": "06-11-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 104, "text": "The ENTITY joins me live on WBZ News Radio. And welcome, ENTITY. If we could get right to the questions, we'd appreciate it. Great. It is nice to hear your voice. The man who allegedly shot at the White House was in court today, as you know. He may soon be indicted on charges that he tried to kill you. I'd like to know, how do you talk to your daughter about that? Well, I think my daughter is well aware of the requirements of the office and that a lot of it involves the Secret Service. But I have to tell you, I think they do a good job. I was not in any danger, and I think this matter is being handled in the appropriate way. We are talking live to ENTITY on WBZ News Radio 1030. ENTITY, as a parent, I am concerned about what seems to be a moral decline in this country. Do you share those concerns? Of course I do. I am especially concerned that so many of our young children are being raised, in effect, in a vacuum where they are so vulnerable to gangs and guns and violence and drugs and where they do not have enough people to look up to and enough people to follow. And they are not being taught right from wrong on a daily basis. I think we have to work on all those things. One of the things that I have tried hard to do as ENTITY is to emphasize the importance of parents and churches and community groups taking responsibility for these children again. And one of the things that I liked about our crime bill was that we enabled church groups and others to apply for assistance to reach out to more of these young people. You know, every child is going to have somebody that he or she looks up to. It needs to be the right person; it needs to be somebody who has a sustained and caring relationship with the child over a long period of time. It ought to be the parents, but if it cannot be, it has to be someone else. That is the only way to turn this around. ENTITY, if we could get on to the campaign trail, campaign '94, as you know, you are not welcomed by some Democrats campaigning for election this year. Personally, how does that make you feel? Well, most elections are decided on the merits within each State. You know, when I was a Governor, I never had the President come and campaign for me, even when the President was a member of my own party and was popular, because I thought that the voters were discriminating about that. But I do think there are some national elements to this election. And particularly in a lot of these races for Congress and Senate, I am pleased to go where I have been asked to go-I have been asked to go more places than I can-to try to say what the stakes are in this election. And they are national. You know, the fact is that in the last 21 months, while we have not solved all the problems in the country and while a lot of ordinary Americans still have difficulties, the country is in better shape than it was. We have got more jobs. The deficit is coming down. We are doing more for families and children. And educational opportunities have been increased. The tax system is fair. The nuclear threat is less. There is more trade in the world. There is more peace, more democracy in the world. We are moving in the right direction at home and abroad. And the voters need to go forward, not back to the easy promises of the eighties. You know, I knew when I took this job, if I really tried to change things I'd have to shake some things up; I would not always be popular. I would not always be popular everywhere in the country and certainly not when people did not know what had been done. So my job is simply to go out in this last week and tell people what is been done, what the stakes are, what the challenges are ahead and let them make up their own minds. ENTITY-we are talking live with the President on WBZ News Radio- what is your take on last week's endorsement of Mario Cuomo by New York GOP Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and could you see yourself ever going out on a limb like that, backing a Republican? Well, I think he did it as an act of statesmanship. I think that Mayor Giuliani saw himself as an American first, a representative of the people of New York, and then a Republican. And he thought that Governor Cuomo would be better for the people of New York City than the policies advocated by Mr. Pataki and his sponsor, Senator D'Amato. I really respect what he did. I think it had to do with what was best for ordinary New Yorkers. I think that is the reason that the mayor of Los Angeles endorsed a Democratic Senator, Senator Feinstein. I think you are seeing a lot of that around the country today as people get worried about the extreme nature of a lot of the Republican campaigns and how divorced they are from the real concerns of ordinary Americans. So obviously I liked it, but I also believe it was an act of statesmanship. Could you envision yourself ever backing a Republican, especially considering the remarks today to Black Entertainment Television calling them far rightwingers, extreme? I did not say they all were. I did not say they all were. I said their congressional leadership had advocated principles that were extreme rightwing, and they have. Oh sure, under the right circumstances, if I were President and we had the equivalent of Oliver North running in the Democratic Party against a responsible Republican alternative, I believe I would do just what President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan have done in Virginia. I certainly do believe that. I know we are running short on time, but Newsweek magazine, you may have seen, gathered a focus group of voters who, rather than being angry with your administration, say they are disappointed. Now, how might you change your agenda the next 2 years, based on what you have and have not accomplished so far? Well, I am going to try to do what we have not done yet. I am going to try to get the Congress to pass welfare reform. I am going to take another run at health care. We have got to find a way to protect the health insurance of people; a million more Americans lost it last year. I am going to take another run at campaign finance reform and at lobbying reform and at some of the environmental measures that we need so badly. But the most important thing I have got to do is to figure out a way to communicate with the American people better. I mean, all the evidence is that the American people basically do not know, for example, that the last 2 years our administration was only the third one since World War II in which Congress approved more than 80 percent of the measures that I recommended, that it included family and medical leave for working families and tax credits for working families with children who are just above the poverty line and immunization of all children under 2 by 1996 and an expansion of Head Start and a big expansion of more affordable college loans for middle class families; that if they did know these things they would have a totally different attitude. So, I really liked the Newsweek poll-focus group-because it showed what I think, which is that the American people, I think, if they knew what I had done and if they knew what we have achieved and if they knew where we were going, I think they'd feel better. I have to do a better job of finding a way to communicate directly with people in an atmosphere which is overwhelmingly dominated by controversy, conflict, failure, combative communication, and just talk straight to the folks. I have given a lot of thought to it; it is a great challenge. But in a democracy, even if you do something, if people do not know it, it does not quite register until they begin personally to benefit. ENTITY, the campaign trail is beckoning, I am sure.

{"id": 149, "text": "The first question, obviously, is about Italy. You were in Italy a few weeks ago. I saw you on the Campidoglio with your wife, a beautiful evening. And you spoke with the new Prime Minister, Mr. Berlusconi. So my question is, how is your sense about Mr. Berlusconi and his policy and the implementation of his policy-the first new government in Italy? Well, my sense was that he had given a lot of thought to what he wished to do and that he was bringing a great deal of energy to the task and that he was determined to pursue a course of economic revival for Italy and to maintain a strong democratic tradition and that, in terms of our relationships, that the traditional strong relationship between the United States and Italy would be maintained vigorously. That was my impression. May I follow up with a question that connects to Italy very quickly? It is Yugoslavia. We are in the front line. And one of the first requests of the government of Italy, Mr. Berlusconi's government, was to let Italy get in the contact group that is working in Geneva. Do you think this request will be evaluated, accepted, on what? I do not know. Let me say first, I think that Italy should be very closely consulted about all developments in Bosnia and in the former Yugoslavia. I think the question the contact group has to face is, how many more people could be let in? In other words, if the membership were expanded, would every country that has troops there-Canada has troops there, would they have to go into the contact group? Would other countries that border the former Yugoslavia and have intense interests there-Turkey is sending troops there-have to be put into the contact group? Or is there some other way to involve Italy closely in the policymaking without doing that? That, I think, is the question. Thank you. Excuse a parochial question, but as you know, we have had two trade agreements in the last couple of years between Canada and the United States. And yet, our trade problems seem to be deteriorating, if anything, over softwood lumber and wheat and now Pacific salmon, so much so, that our Trade Minister, Roy MacLaren, has warned of a trade show between our two countries. And even your Ambassador to Ottawa has criticized U.S. actions on wheat. Do you think the time has come for you to become personally involved on this issue before it deteriorates much further? Or is the U.S. view that Canada is an unfair trader? Well, I think that is not the only two options. First of all, keep in mind, this is the biggest bilateral trading relationship in the world, as far as I know. It is certainly our biggest trading relationship. It is a huge, huge relationship. And in one that big, it should not be surprising that there would be some frictions from time to time. In all three areas that you mentioned, you have people engaged in the same economic activity, living very close to each other under different government policies and frameworks. That is true with lumber, that is true with wheat, and it is true with salmon. Now, our problem with the whole salmon issue, of course, is complicated by the whole question of the size of the population and what the future of it is. And I think there are- I really believe there are ways for us to work that out. I believe that problem will be worked out. And I have talked to our people about it; I think we are all working very hard on that. The timber disputes are of longstanding and recur from time to time, as you know. Eight years, I think. And I think-I think we have to let that one play out through the regular course of events. With regard to the wheat issue, I think the question there-it is been referred for dispute resolution, and the ordinary process may resolve it. The real problem there is that the U.S. and Canada need to agree somehow on what does or does not constitute a subsidy. I think we need some general agreements that might solve the wheat problem and some other problems as well. But I think it is important that we not overreact to this. It is a very big issue here. I mean, our wheat farmers in North Dakota are on the verge of hysteria all the time. They think they have been treated unfairly. And in Congress, there are Representatives from certain States for whom this is the only issue because they think they have been treated unfairly. So I am trying to work it out. We do not have any bilateral relationship where we have more in common and where we tend to work more together. I mean, Prime Minister Chretien has worked with me very closely, and the Canadian Government has always worked with the American Government on everything from issues in the U.N., with problems in Haiti, our policy toward NATO, the whole range of issues. And as far as I know, these are the only three disputes we have, and we are trying to work through them as best we can. ENTITY, the dollar has known quite a rough ride on the currency markets these recent weeks, giving the impression that your Government did not want to do anything about it. Do you think a weak dollar is good for the American economy, maybe for trade purposes? And if not, do you intend to do or say anything about it? And do you expect the G-7 meeting to take some resolution about that? I expect it will be discussed. But let me answer the question. No, I do not think it is good for the American economy to have-or let me put it in a more affirmative way. The United States is not trying to grow its economy on a weak dollar. We do not believe a country can devaluate itself into prosperity. On the other hand, these currency markets are subject to significant fluctuations. And great care should be taken before unusual actions are taken, it seems to me. And it is, I think, in the end, over the longrun, the markets tend to align with market realities. When I became , we had been exploding our Government deficits for 12 years. Investment was down; job growth was down. And we decided to change our policy so that the American economy would be stronger in the global economy and so that ordinary Americans would be better off. We have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in Government spending. We have slashed our-we are slashing our work force in the Government by about 12.5 percent, to make it the smallest it has been in three decades. We are targeting investments to areas of economic growth, like education and training and technology. And we have given certain tax incentives to small businesses, new businesses, lower wage workers. The impact of all this has been that, as I leave for the G-7, in the last year and a half, the U.S. has 40 percent of the GDP of the G-7. But we have had 75 percent of the growth and almost 100 percent of the new jobs. Our exports and our rate of investment are growing higher-more than the average in the G-7. Our rate of productivity is growing more than the average of the G-7 countries. So I believe the best answer to this over the longrun is a strong American economy. Transitory political developments in various countries may explain what is going on. There may be a lot of other explanations. But the main thing is, I do not wish-I do not take the weakness of the dollar lightly against any currency. I do not want the dollar to be too low. I am not trying to expand the American economy through a low dollar. No country has ever devaluated itself into prosperity. The United States wants to grow into prosperity, to trade into prosperity, not to devaluate itself into prosperity. ENTITY, you are also going to Germany after the G-7 summit. And Germany is more or less emerging as perhaps the European leader. And on the other hand, a lot of Germans are very reluctant to claim this role for their country. What is your wish and your perception of Germany in the future? Will it be the European leader? And would you be prepared to offer a partnership in leadership as your predecessor, President Bush, did? Well, I think we do have a very good partnership with Germany. Mr. Bitterlich was quoted in the Wall Street Journal today about the strong support our administration had given, stronger than previous ones, to European unity and to the European defense capacity and to greater strength and unity within Europe. Germany has strongly supported that. Of course, it is up to the German people and to the leaders of Germany to determine what role will be played and then up to the partners that you have within Europe. But I think that Germany has a major role to play in the future in world affairs, has a strong role to play in Europe. I support what I take to be the policy of Germany, which is support for increasing European integration and increasing efforts to reach out to the East. And I feel very comfortable with that. But you are not really into endorsing partnership in leadership, do you? As I already told you, Mr. Bitterlich said that we had a better partnership than you had before. So, you have to define what your role is going to be. It is not up to the United States. I do not see how Germany can walk away from a leadership role. You have the third biggest economy in the world. You have a huge population. You have absorbed the East, and you have managed to keep your economy strong, with all the incredible demands. You have played a very constructive role in a lot of United Nations activities. So, I think you have no choice but to play a leadership role. It is not an option. You have been by far more generous than any other country in investing to your east. I think that it is not even an option to talk about a world in which Germany does not play a leadership role. You cannot withdraw from your responsibilities. Even if you sought to, the vacuum that would be created would require you to move ahead again. But the point I want to make is exactly how these relationships will be-will work themselves out in Europe, for example, is a matter for the Europeans to determine. France has, for example, recently has played a very strong role along with Britain in Bosnia, providing the bulk of the UNPROFOR troops. Canadians have made a major contribution. France recently took the initiative to go to Rwanda, and the United States supported the United Nations giving an approval for France to send troops there to do that until we could put together an African force, that is, a U.N. force. I think that there will be many variations of leadership in the years ahead. But one thing that I am sure of is that the size of the German economy and the values that have been demonstrated by the German leadership guarantee that there will be a leadership role for Germany and that it will be a positive thing for the rest of Europe and for the world. The relationship between the United States and Japan is facing a little bit of difficulty. Trade conflict has caused turmoil of the currency market, and so-called framework talks have restarted but have not reached any agreement yet. Under those circumstances, Mr. Murayama, Socialist leader, was elected Japan's next Prime Minister, and you are going to meet him for the first time in Naples. ENTITY, how are you going to manage with Japan's new government and reestablish a good relationship of both countries? I had a good talk with him last night. I called him last night. And we had a very good visit. We reaffirmed our commitment to our relationship, our security partnership, our political partnership, and our economic partnership. And Mr. Murayama said that he hoped we could continue to make progress in the frameworks. If we'd both make our best efforts, he thought we could. It is difficult, I think, to expect to have too high expectations for what has happened in the last several months because of all the political changes which have occurred within Japan. But I think we have continued to work along together. I think the important thing I would say-it is sort of like the argument I made to the gentleman from Canada. If you look at the relationship the United States and Japan-our troops are still there. Our military partnership is very strong. We worked as one to try to defuse the crisis in North Korea with regard to the North Korean nuclear program. I did everything I could to make sure that every step along the way, everything I did was coordinated closely with not just South Korea but also with Japan. Because of that and because-to get to the next question-our continuing strengthening relationship with Russia. We had good relationships with Russia during this period. We were able to reach out to the Chinese. But it worked because of the historic ties we have had. So again, I would say that it is very important not to let trade disputes or any other disputes that are inevitable in a world where the economy has been growing slowly and where competition is stiff and where we have not yet solved the problem of how wealthy countries promote growth and new jobs in a highly competitive global economy, these things are going to happen from time to time. The important thing is to be able to absorb them and just deal with them in a disciplined and regular way and not let the other aspects of the relationship get out of hand. And that is what I hope will happen. I mean, the United States and Japan have had some serious differences over trade. But they have not interrupted rather an enormous bilateral investment and trade relationship and a deep political partnership. I think the Emperor and Empress, on their recent trip here, were deeply moved by the friendship and the intensity of the friendship for them and for the Japanese people that were demonstrated by the Americans. So I think the feeling in this country about Japan is as strong and as positive as it has ever been. And you know, you are going through a period of political change. You have to work that out. That is what democracies do from time to time. Nothing is ever stable forever. You know, things change. And so, as that-the whole yen-dollar relationship may be in part a product of the perception that maybe things will not change quickly enough because of political conditions. But I think what we have to do is to reassure people that you have got two strong economies here, that these things will work themselves out if we just have the discipline to do it. ENTITY, your first stop will be in Riga, and it is going to be a real and joyful celebration of independence. Many Latvians, as well as many Russians, were humiliated by the-. And we are really happy that these countries are now independent. The real, very hard question among the former Soviet people-recent developments show and especially the Presidential races in Ukraine and Belarus show-a lot of people stand for much closer cooperation with Russia. So can you, sir, envision any kind of democratic and legal reunification of some of the former Soviet republics- newly independent states-without causing a threat to Central European countries, to Baltic countries, to Europe, to national interests of the United States and all of the world? Thank you. I think that that depends upon whether such decisions would be made really voluntarily and by will of a majority of the people. That is, I sense, particularly-and I have been to Belarus, so I have a feeling for that. I have also been to Ukraine, but I have not spent as much time. It is a very large country, and there are many different layers and opinions there. But I think that it depends upon whether such movements would develop out of a genuine democratic movement and a free will of the people involved. I have to say that, from my point of view, the policies that President Yeltsin has pursued in the Baltics are very reassuring. As you know, the Russian troops have withdrawn from Lithuania, that we are very close to resolving the final matters in Latvia. There are still a few issues left in Estonia. The United States strongly supports the protection of Russians who remain in the Baltics and the whole issue of minority rights. It is a very big issue for us and our country and throughout the world. But I think the feeling in Central and Eastern Europe about the intentions of Russia is probably more positive now than it was even 6 months ago. And the steadfastness of Russia in continuing to move its troops out of the Baltics is a major part of that. So that if there is a truly independent political development in Belarus, for example, that says, you know, we think we'd be better off if we had some sort of different relationship with Russia, that, I think, will depend on what actually happens. I mean, the people of Central and Eastern Europe will know if some new development occurs. I think they will know in their hearts and minds whether it was a grassroots, honest, democratic impulse. And that will be the test. ENTITY, the British Government finds itself once again in a familiar position in Europe, i.e. in a minority of one, on the issue of vetoing the new candidate to head the European Commission. When you talked earlier about your desire for European integration, is that the same thing as supporting a federal Europe along the lines proposed by the Germans and the Belgians and the French? And do you think the British are being unnecessarily skeptical about the creation of a federal European state? I do not know that I have an informed opinion about that. I mean, I think that, again, I think that each of you are sovereign nations, and you will have to make up your mind about what you think is in your national interest. It is my-the only thing I can tell you is that the United States has viewed as in its national interest an economically integrated but open Europe. That is, the fact that Europe would become stronger and more economically integrated, not only through the European Union but also reaching out to the East, we have not viewed as threatening. We have viewed that as positive, because I think that we have to find ways to add wealth to the world's economies every year, to add to the growth rate. We also have not viewed with alarm, at least in my administration, the prospect that there could be greater European security cooperation between the French and the Germans and between others as well. But we are willing to continue to be partners through NATO. Now, how far you should go with your political integration is just a decision you will have to make. And we do not have views about that one way or the other except to say we are not threatened that you wish to be closer together in economic or military or political ways. That does not threaten the United States. We feel a stronger Europe makes for a more democratic and a stronger world. But you will have to make up your mind about the politics of it. It is not for us to say whether you are right or wrong. It is for you to say. ENTITY, you are going to start highlevel talks with North Korea. Which do you prefer, the normalization of the relationship of both countries or the solution of nuclear suspicion, I mean especially-to which do you put--weight, the so-called past suspicion or the current and future suspicion of North Korea? You mean with regard to the nuclear issue? Yes. Well, it is not so easy to divide them, because of the obligations North Korea undertook in becoming a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime, because that means that North Korea has to be open to inspection by the IAEA for all its facilities from the day that it became a member, forward. I mean, if you asked me, am I more concerned about whether North Korea has one or two nuclear weapons or the capacity to make them now or whether they might make two dozen in the future, that is an easy question to answer. I am more concerned about two dozen than I am one or two. But in the-when you become a member of one of these international organizations and you assume the responsibilities of membership, then you have to honor those responsibilities. In terms of reunification and normalization of relations, all those things, those things will have to be worked out partly between the north and the south, and I am elated that they are going to meet. I think that is a good thing, the leaders of the two countries. But we will begin our discussions first on July 8th. And what we hope to do is to find ways to broaden this debate because really what this is about is, even more than the nuclear weapons, is what role will North Korea assume in the future? What is the vision of the leaders of North Korea for that nation at the turn of the century or 20 years from now? Should it be an isolated country that makes money from selling No Dong missiles and low-level nuclear materials? Or should it be a country that is in harmony with its neighbors and friends, using the industry and ability of its people to strengthen trade and commerce and the personal development of its people? To me that is an easy question to answer. If there is no threat to North Korea's security, if we mean them no ill, if Japan, if South Korea, if Russia, if China, if all of its neighbors wish to be partners in a more open world, and if the United States has that wish, then surely we should be able to work this problem out. That is my hope and my objective. ENTITY, thank you. The last question is, who is going to win the World Cup, except the U.S.? I know that your daughter plays soccer. Yes. Well, if I take a position on that-you know, every time I take a position at home, I make a few million people mad. Now, if I take a position on that, I will make billions of people angry. -chance. That is right. I have quite enough-- -in the world-- I have quite enough controversy without that. I am still pulling for the United States, you know. I like the underdogs when they fight. And we-this is the first time we have ever made the second round, I think. Yes, it is the first time in history. Yes. And we did not want to be the first host team never to make the second round. And we are playing better than expectations. So I am going to keep cheering for the U.S. until we are eliminated.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists6", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-6", "publication_date": "01-07-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 143, "text": "ENTITY, one of the things that you have been talking to your coleaders about is, of course, Lithuania. Your position so far has been to suggest that the Lithuanian crisis can be resolved by dialog. I just wonder whether you think that we are approaching the moment when Western nations will have to give more direct assistance to Lithuania, particularly if there is an oil embargo. I think that is a little hypothetical, because I have been in contact with the Soviet leaders -- indeed, had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Shevardnadze right here, in that chair over there -- and also have been in contact with Gorbachev. And I feel comfortable that they know the U.S. position; and I have felt that, having expressed our interest in self-determination and the peaceful evolution of all of this, that we are positioned about right. I do not think there is any question as to where I feel and, indeed, after consultation with our allies, where they feel. But I think it is a little premature to -- or perhaps a little hypothetical to suggest escalation of what we might do. I want to be sure anything we do is productive. There is been dramatic change in the world, and I do not want to inadvertently take some action that would set it back. And yet I do not want to be seen as one who is not interested in the peaceful change and in the self-determination for Lithuania. We are in a position of never having recognized the incorporation of Lithuania, and indeed Estonia and Latvia, into the Soviet Union. So, that gives us a little bit of a standing that others might not have in terms of how we view this problem. But I just do not want to go into what we might do. I can understand the great interests in other countries and, certainly, in this country. But right now I'd like to, having expressed our concerns to the Soviets, watch the evolution here. ENTITY, you are going to meet Mr. Mitterrand next Thursday in Key Largo. And there has been in the French press a report about some misunderstanding in France and the U.S. about the NATO future role. Do you share any of those views, and it is true that your administration is pushing for France to get more involved in the alliance? Look, the main thing is that France and the United States be in total synchronization on alliance problems. France has a special historical position regarding the NATO alliance. But one of the reasons for having this meeting is to narrow any differences that might exist. I go down to Key Largo not feeling there are big differences with Mr. Mitterrand in this question. But I want to get his views. I want to tell him ours, and if there are differences, see if we can narrow them. But it is my conviction that NATO will have a perhaps even more important role to play in the stability of Europe -- East and West -- projecting stability for East and Western Europe. And I would think that that might be shared by President Mitterrand, but I will be talking to him about this question because there have been reports that there was a little drift and a little separation. And the best way to find that out is simply to sit and talk, as we will do there. I can say this: that I have found my direct talks with him extraordinarily helpful in the past, and I expect this will be the same way. One of the key subjects will be security and arrangements for Europe after the unification of Germany. And that obviously will entail discussing our view for an expanded role for NATO. His view -- it does not exclude that but has a keen interest in a role for CSCE. And we see that. We have also talked about expanded participation in the EC, and I will try to elaborate on that with Mr. Mitterrand. So, I know we are not egregiously apart at all. But if there are these differences, get them out on the table and talk about them. ENTITY, you say you are concerned about what might happen in Lithuania. There is also a strong independence movement in Quebec. And recently declassified State Department documents show that during the last peak of separatist sentiment in Quebec about a dozen years ago the U.S. was indeed very concerned about the prospect of a separate Quebec. Can you tell me what your concerns are about that prospect and what it could mean for U.S.-Canada relations and Quebec-U.S. relations? My experience is to stay out of a matter that is bubbling around up there in Canada right now, courageously sit on the sidelines, and say this: that we have always enjoyed the most cordial relations with a unified Canada. And that came up at a press conference we had up in Canada the other day there at the ball park. And I took the same view: that this is not a point at which the United States ought to involve itself in the internal affairs of Canada. ENTITY, the British Labour Party, the opposition Labour Party, is very, very far ahead in the opinion polls in Britain at the moment. It is had an avowedly unilateralist past, and your predecessor seemed to treat it with a great deal of suspicion. I wonder if you now think that these people are people you can do business with and people you can talk to, and whether you have this sort of special relationship that you would like to have with the British Government? May I say this: that I have not given any thought to it all because Margaret Thatcher is the head of the Government and the Prime Minister and we are in close consultation and negotiation with her. So, I really would leave it there, because without suggesting any hostility toward opposition parties or towards -- in this sense, since you asked about Labour -- but I just, again, think it would be inappropriate to publicly speculate on what the U.S. might do. We do have a special relationship, and it'll continue, I am sure. And these talks just reinforce that, these talks that I had with Prime Minister Thatcher. So, excuse me if I do not want to get into the bubbling caldron of domestic politics inside the U.K. right now. ENTITY, you seem to have had very substantial success in your relationship with Japan in the last couple of months. The SII seems to have been moving along quite happily. I wonder whether that is a vindication of 3 years' worth of pressure from the Hill for a tough stance on trade issues. There is no question that the Hill, and indeed a lot of America, have wanted to see action taken by the Japanese. I would like to give credit to our negotiators, who are in the administrative executive branch of the Government, and also to Prime Minister Kaifu, who has taken the position that I think some of his critics here and abroad felt he would not take, a position that we view quite forthcoming on SII and on specific categories of trade. So, the jury is still out in terms of how the Hill will look at what has happened, but I have been very pleased so far that most of the leaders on Capitol Hill seem to feel that under Kaifu's leadership Japan has really moved on these important items. But I guess the answer is, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Also, there are certain undertakings that we make under SII. And Congress ought not to simply criticize Japan, even though I will readily concede there is been room for criticism there, and so stated. But I think we, the executive branch and the legislative branch, ought to work together now to fulfill our undertakings on investment, savings, education, budget deficits. It is a two-way street. But so far, I have been quite pleased. And -- back to your question -- I do not know whether it is Hill pressure, because for years Japanese leaders would come here, and hear the message from the Hill, go back; and we did not have demonstrable progress. So, I think, in fairness, the Hill pressure has been relatively constant. We ought to take a look at what is different. And what is different is the way in which Prime Minister Kaifu, and indeed some of the other leaders there, have approached this problem. ENTITY, just to go back to the NATO issue, could you envision now the French being supreme commander of NATO? We are very happy with the present arrangements. You see, I think it is true in France and I know it is true in other countries: People view the U.S. presence as stabilizing, as having played a significant role in preserving a peace that, in terms of European history, is a long one. And I do not want to have this coming out in a chauvinistic sense, but I think the American people have to feel, one, the American presence is wanted. And part of the command structure, I think, contributes to the view that we have an important role to play and the Europeans want us to have an important role to play. So, I have given no thought to any substantive changes in all of this. But if anybody has a different view, I'd be willing to hear it. But this is why I am happy with the existing structure. ENTITY, your officials and Mexican officials have said they are ready to pursue, or at least consider, the idea of a free trade agreement. When you were in Toronto last week, you did say that you thought Canada should continue to show interest in trade with Mexico. Do you think it is a good idea for Canada to pursue a separate deal with Mexico; or should Canada, Mexico, and the United States sit down together and pursue a three-way deal, just as the European Community is working together? Are you talking about a free trade agreement? A free trade agreement. I think it is premature for a three-way free trade agreement. I expect Mexico feels that way; I believe that Canada feels that way. I talked in the campaign about a North American accord and doing more together. But the sensitivities on this question in Mexico are such that we ought to let President Salinas set the pace here. And so, it is a sensitive subject there, just as some fallout from the free trade agreement with Canada and the U.S. is sensitive. So, I think it is better to crawl before you walk, walk before you run. And the next step is to sit and talk with the President of Mexico, if this is still on his agenda, when he comes up here. And I say that because I do not want to be out saying what our meeting is going to be about. But you are right that there has been public speculation on this; indeed, different officials in our administration and Mexico have talked about it. But because of its sensitivity, I prefer to let Mexico speak for itself, and simply say I think we need to move forward in a bilateral sense, and Canada might want to move forward in a bilateral sense -- that is up to them, though -- before we talk about a North American accord meeting, a three-way free trade agreement. ENTITY, when you were in Bermuda, did you discuss with Mrs. Thatcher the status of the Trident, which as you know the Labour Party would like to include very quickly in arms control negotiations? Do you expect to discuss the French independent deterrent with Mr. Mitterrand? We touched only peripherally on that. Prime Minister Thatcher knows that she does not have to sell me on the French and British deterrence and the way in which they view their own nuclear capability. So, it was not what I would call a significant agenda item because I do not think we have any differences. ENTITY, you were in those. Is that about the way it was? I do not think it was, unless there were some other discussions that went on not in our group. Mr. Scowcroft. No, there was not an extended discussion because there are not really any points at issue. Yes, we did not have it as a formal agenda item. ENTITY, did you like the phrase, first among equals, as a description of your vision of America's place in the network of democratic alliances? Well, I think many of our allies look to us as the first among equals, given the blessing of the size of our gross national product and given our historic commitment to the security of others. But I do not know that -- when I go sit down at a NATO meeting, I do not go there seeking a kind of recognition on that point. But I think the realities of the world are such that many look to us as essential -- in this instance -- the security of Europe. Certainly, we have got to be dealt with on trade matters. And I am one who does not believe some of these elitist theories about the decline of America. I do not believe it; I do not think the American people believe it; I do not believe our allies believe it. ENTITY, do you think that the new Germany we have seen to come out in -- one day is going to make and to cause any major problems -- we being the EEC? No. Within these what? The EEC, the European Economic Community. There are some worries, you know. Yes, there are some concerns there about it, but I expect they can be sorted out. But the concept of a unified Germany does not cause me worries. I know there are perhaps nuances of difference on this one, but Germany has been a strong democracy here for a long time now -- a long time. And the NATO position has been: Unification is okay. We do not worry about that at all. But we want to stay involved as the United States. We want to be there as one who enthusiastically would deal with a unified Germany. And after this unity, there will be problems that we probably have not even considered. But we are not opposed to it, and we do not worry about it. Mr. Fitzwater. We are going to have to break. If you have got a final question or two. Well, I -- -- In the name of egalite, fraternite. -- -- stay on the sidelines just on a followup. Go ahead. Try. You have made clear your -- -- You will find I am immovable -- -- -- -- preference for a strong, unified Canada. Why? What difference does it make whether the United States is dealing with a separate Quebec? It makes the difference that this is the internal affair of Canada. And I learned something long ago: Do not intervene in the internal affairs of another country. That is pretty hard sometimes. In this one, it is easy. You get another question because that was so cinchy. Go ahead. Oh, I do have another question? Yes. That is because that is just a follow-on to the other one, and it is just -- look, that is a cinch, that one. The question that many young Canadians sometimes ask me when I am visiting back in Canada is: Mr. Bush has come to Ottawa -- a quick trip to Ottawa, a quick trip to Vancouver, a quick trip to Toronto. He never seems to stay overnight. When he goes to Bermuda, he will stay overnight, or he will do this. Is there some reason that you do not like Canada, or is it too cold for you? Is there not good sporting and fishing up there? It is worth staying for? It is fantastic, but I have mean schedulers. I have invidious people there that do not let me do that which I'd like to do. And besides that, I have such a good feeling about Canada that frankly it never entered my mind if some might feel this way. But someday I will have the joy of doing that which I like best: recreating in Canada. Because I have been to Banff; I have been to the west. I know the country reasonably well. And I'd like to think that I would have a scheduler around here who would be a little more considerate and permit me to do that. Frankly, I think it is a good thing -- the baseball recreation there -- because the Blue Jays drew more, I am told, than any other team last year. They have got a fantastic stadium. And it sends a good hands-across-the-border signal. So, even though I get sheer pleasure out of going there and the little annoyance about Canada's defeat of the Texas Rangers, I think it was worthwhile for our national pastime -- a game that I really enjoy. So, I got some recreation there in that fantastic baseball stadium, but not near enough. So, if any of your readers feel there is any slight, tell them to call a man named Joe Hagin. His number is 456 - 1414. Could I just ask, ENTITY, do you think that after a week in which Mrs. Thatcher was very heavily criticized and virtually written off in the American press whether her final reputation will be affected by -- -- By what? Whether her final reputation will be affected by the pasting which she has taken in the last couple of weeks here and the differences you have had over Europe and Germany? Look, I read these polls. And I do not know what Mr. Ortega's pollster is doing now, and I do not know what the guy that said I would not win because I was 17 points back in the summer of 1988 is doing now. But whether polls are right or wrong -- and I do not want to denigrate all pollsters because I think there is a science there that sometimes is quite accurate. But I have just pointed out a couple of egregious errors here. But I do not think you deal with heads of government based on whether they are up or down in the polls, or even speculate. So, I was giving you a very honest answer about the opposition. I mean, the opposition leaders would come here, we'd see them. I would think that is the way it ought to be. But I am enough of a politician to know that people can be down one moment and then soaring like an eagle the next. So, I missed your question just a little. What was it? I asked about her long-term reputation. Perhaps you could sum up, because whatever happens, she is coming to the end of a very long time in office. Could you say anything about what you think her long-term -- -- No, no. That would be a matter for -- -- -- -- reputation? Well, a reputation -- -- Do you think -- -- Oh, excuse me. I thought you meant whether she would rebound from all of this. Well, I think, at least in this country, people see her as a very courageous, principled leader who fights for her beliefs and has survived many ups and downs. So, they give her great credit. And I would be, in that vein, for courage and for -- and another thing that she gets credit for here is a special feeling about the United States, a recognition that it is good for the U.K. and the U.S. to be close. I think she gets great credit from that not just in conservative circles or, say, Republican circles or IDU-affiliated circles, but across the board here in our country they see her as a tough, courageous leader who has enjoyed great success and with whom Presidents have enjoyed a very close, important relationship.

{"id": 159, "text": "Sir, since I went to high school in Texas-- Where did you go? Edinburg, sir. Did you? Edinburg High School? Yes, class of '74. You have got to be kidding me. Edinburg High School. Is not that interesting? Nobody knows where Edinburg is except for me and you. It happens to be on the Mexican border. It is-what year were you there? In '74. Oh, man. You been down there since? Yes, several times. Amazing, is not it, how it is changed? Yes, it has. The benefits of free trade. People need to-if you could have seen Edinburg in '74 and Edinburg in 2004 and now 2008, you'd be amazed at the changes as a result of free and fair trade between the United States and Mexico. And therefore, one other point will be, of course, complete Doha successfully. Thank you for reminding me of the importance of free trade. ENTITY, thank you very much for giving us this opportunity to ask questions, sir. And first, let me start with a very Japan-specific question about North Korea and abductees issue. Sir, at the press conference on June 26, you made a-said that the United States would not abandon its strong ally when it comes to resolving this abductee issue. But in spite of this very strong statement that you made, there are still some doubts and concerns in Japan, especially among the families of abductees, that the United States might try to resolve this nuclear issue at the expense of the abductee issue. And Mrs. Yokota, who you met in your Oval Office 2 years ago, reportedly said that she was irritated because she felt that Japan was ignored. What exactly do you plan to do to assure Japanese Government and the people that the United States will not abandon Japan in the process of rescinding North Korea's designation of a state sponsor of terror? And what will the United States do to help bring progress to this issue within 45 days of this delisting process, sir? Yes. Well, first of all, I can understand the mom's concerns. I got to see firsthand in the Oval Office how- her sense of anguish and hurt that her sweet daughter had been abducted. So I understand the emotions of the issue. As a matter of fact, I invited her to come because I wanted to-I wanted her and others to see firsthand my personal concern. The truth of the matter is, if I was not concerned about the issue and did not think it was a priority, I would not have invited her to the Oval Office. Secondly, I believe that the six-party talks is the best way to effect change in the North Korean regime, positive change. One such change, of course, is to head toward a common objective, which is a nuclear free-a nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula, which is in our interest, and it is in Japanese interests. Secondly, there are other issues, of course, to be dealt with in this framework. And one such issue is the abductee issue. The question is, can Japan solve this issue alone better, or does it make sense to have the United States and other countries expressing the same concerns? I happen to believe that it is in your country's interest to have the United States and other countries helping you on this issue. And therefore, I view the six-party talks as a framework to convince the North Korean Government to deal with these serious issues. And you know, people-I can understand people saying, well, I guess this is the beginning of the end of U.S. concern. But I will say it again, like I have said it time and time again, this is the beginning of our concern, and it is a framework to help solve the concerns of the parents, the people of Japan, and the Japanese Government. In terms of the recent declaration, this was agreed to by the Japanese Government. This was an understanding that this is how we are going to move the process forward. But this is only one step. I think some of your listeners or readers probably think that, well, this is the end of the process. No, this is the beginning of the process. And there is a lot more work to be done. And our policy is action for action. And what is changed is, it used to be, okay, we will give the North Koreans a concession and hope they respond. Now it is , when they act, we respond. And part of the agenda is the abductee issue. Yes. They call you ? Hi. Yes. Thank you very much, ENTITY. I'd like to just follow up on the North Korea issue. There is in Japan- there is concern in Japan that the golden era of the U.S.-Japan alliance has passed, the historical--of alliance is now degrading. So how do you think that, in this context, the removal of North Korea from the list affects the U.S.-Japan alliance? It is interesting. Somebody told me that beginning to creep into the dialogue there is-the six-party talks really is-you know, will undermine the bilateral relations between Japan and the United States. I fully reject that. It is like saying, okay, we are all part of the United Nations, therefore, bilateral relations do not matter. Multilateral forums to address an issue strengthens relations; they do not weaken relations. And the fundamental question is, how do you solve the problem of North Korea? That is the question. That is what the six-party talks were aimed to address. The history of this issue was, at one point in time, it was really only the United States that was dealing with the issue; others were kind of there, but they were not that-they basically said, here, go solve it. And it is an effective way to deal with a problem way diplomatically. In order to solve a problem diplomatically, there has to be other voices who say, here is what we expect, and if not, here are the consequences. And that is why it was so important to convince the Chinese, for example, to become a party to the six-party talks. In the meantime, however, we have been working very closely with Japan on a variety of issues. You notice we are no longer talking about basing issues. Why? Because our bilateral relations were such that we are able to deal with them. We were able to work together in Afghanistan and Iraq. We were able to work together on humanitarian issues in places like Afghanistan. In other words, our bilateral relations have thrived during this period when the six-party talks were constructed. The only thing I can do is just tell people how I view it-when I go to Japan or through objective agents such as yourself- and it is: Our relations have been important; they are important, and they will be important. And as I said in my opening statement, this really is a cornerstone to our policies in Northeast Asia. Thank you, ENTITY. Again, on North Korea-- Sure, yes. Is this going to be six North Korea questions? I can handle all six, trust me. Well, last week, you said you do not have any-you have no illusions about the North Korean regime, Kim Jong Il. So the question might be hypothetical, but if North Korea-- No, it is hypothetical, I can tell you-when you start with an if. You can try a hypothetical. In the case North Korea does not fulfill its obligation, such as disclosing a number of the weapons that they have or nondisclosing of the enrichment-- Or dealing fairly on abductees. --yes, abductees or proliferation issue, activities to Syria, what kind of message do you think you'd-- Well, we will of course work with our partners. Now, for example, these will not be unilateral sanctions. These will be multiparty sanctions. But first of all, this regime is highly sanctioned. They have been isolated. And if they choose not to move forward on an agreed-upon way forward, action for action, there will be further isolation and further deprivation for the people of North Korea. The regime had made a conscious decision to at least make a declaration within the six-party talks to move forward. I would only surmise that perhaps the leader of North Korea is tired of being isolated in the world and would try to advance his country in a way that makes it easier for the people to have a better life. And therefore, if you read the statements that started the six-party-that confirm the six-party talks, about what the pledges are, there are very concrete-it is a concrete action plan. But keep in mind, at this point in time, this is still a regime that is highly sanctioned. So step one is, if he chooses not to move forward, then the status quo is for certain, and he will remain highly sanctioned. And then, of course, there will be great disappointment with the other parties involved in the six-party talks. Expectations are that he will move forward, action for action. But if he does not , we now have partners at the table who will be wondering how best to send yet another message to him. And the good news: It will not be just Japan and the United States; there will be other countries there. This is how multilateral diplomacy works. And I repeat to you: The six-party talks have been aimed to set a framework in place that will serve as an inducement to go forward, but also that can be consequential. And we, of course, will consult with our partners to deal about-I mean, step one is no change in the current status, which means highly sanctioned-probably the most sanctioned nation in the world. And step two is, of course, we will consult and figure out a way forward. My hope is, is that the North Koreans continue to move forward. And you mentioned what we expect. We expect there to be full declaration of manufactured plutonium, we expect there to be a full disclosure of any enrichment activities and proliferation activities, and we expect the abductee issue to be solved. Thank you, ENTITY. I'd like to ask a climate change issue. Climate change, yes. In the upcoming summit, Prime Minister Fukuda hopes to set a long-term goal for curbing greenhouse gas emission, and I think you share the idea. What goals do you have going into the summit, and do you expect to strike an agreement on that? I am hopeful we can strike an agreement. But I caution everybody that such an agreement must have all of us who create greenhouse gases, not just those of us around the table at the G-8. And that is why we worked with the Prime Minister to have this major economies meeting; it was to strengthen the G-8, is to make it relevant. You know, it is an interesting notion that-I said today in my press availability in the Rose Garden-I do not know if you were there or not-you know, I wonder whether or not some of these nations who are creating greenhouse gases, but considered still developing nations, are used to the period of Kyoto, when they were not held to account about what they were producing. I wonder if that is their mindset. Because if it is, it'll make any international agreement ineffective if they are not a part to it, because, you know, it is estimated that-well, China is creating a lot of greenhouse gases and will continue to do so. And therefore, Japan and the United States can maybe make decisions that affect our own production, but it will be ineffective at solving the problem unless China is with us. And so my hope there is to move the process along so that we, at a very minimum, send a clear message to developing countries that are producing greenhouse gases that we expect you to be a part of an agreement. And step one is a long-term goal. In other words, if you can get nations to commit to a goal, you have got them committed to a process. If, however, the process does not matter whether you are a part or not, or you may be a part at some point in time, in my mind that will not produce the results that are necessary to deal with the global climate change issue. And so we will see how that goes. We are working it very hard, as is the Prime Minister and other nations. The other thing we can do is we can talk about some just practical things we can do, such as insisting that we reduce tariffs and trade barriers on pollution equipment. It makes no sense to make such equipment prohibitively expensive when it is-when there are some basic technologies that could move and can help. And I will be talking about technologies there as well. And I told you about some of the technologies dealing with automobiles and, you know, the interesting thing is, is that the world is now beginning to waken up to the beauty of nuclear power. And I mean, if one is really concerned about global warming and greenhouse gases, they ought to be carrying signs insisting upon the development of nuclear power plants. This is renewable energy with zero greenhouse gas emissions. And yet the world-parts of the world are very reluctant about-even in our country, it is very difficult to build a plant. We have been able to get some regulatory relief through Government action. I think four new plants have been permitted, or four expansions have been permitted. But we ought to be- about 25 percent of our electricity comes from nuclear power, and it ought to be a lot higher. And you know, one of the things that interesting is, Japan and the United States are working on technologies to deal with the waste. And that will-if that-when that technology comes to fruition, it will ease some people's concerns. There will be some who just simply will never buy into nuclear power. I fully understand that. But this will be a great opportunity to discuss about other things we can do while we are trying to work-you know, by the way, everything we are going to do is meant to strengthen the United Nations process and not weaken it. And so anyway, that is kind of what is on my mind going into the meetings. Thank you very much. Oishi. Hello. Yes. Nikkei is economic newspaper, so let us talk about economy. You are an economic newspaper? Yes. You are the Wall Street Journal. . More famous than the Wall Street Journal. More famous. Well, that is good. So, ENTITY, I know your strong U.S. dollar policy-- Yes, that is true. --but do you know how to make it stronger? Or do you expect the possibility of the U.S. intervention in the fiscal-financial market? We believe that the relative worth of economies should set respective currencies. And therefore, the best way to reinforce our strong dollar policy is to keep taxes low in the United States, ease regulatory burdens, become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, and make it clear that we are for free and fair trade. That not only means the trading of goods and services, but also the investment-that the United States is open to investment. And to me, those are the best ways to deal with the fundamental aspects of an economy, that assures the world that the United States will be a vibrant, strong economy, and that eventually will be reflected in our currency. Would you like another economic question? Well, does Europe share the same view? Does who? Does Europe-- Share the same view of the U.S. dollar? I think they want there to be-it is an interesting question. I heard concern about our dollar, and I believe they support the U.S. strong dollar policy. Thank you, ENTITY. My question is on North Korea and Iran. North Korea. North Korea and Iran. Okay, good. So you have looked at multilateral diplomacy in dealing with North Korea and made a decision to move it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in return for actually a far from perfect declaration on its nuclear activities. Some people say that this is kind of appeasement or a double standard compared to the way you dealt with Iraq. So do you think the way you dealt with Iraq-with North Korea, namely, action for action principle, through multilateral diplomacy, rather than military option, would be an effective and realistic motive for preventing an Iran with nuclear weapons? And if so, what exact action do you want from Iran? And what action is the United States ready to offer to Iran? Yes, sure, thank you. First of all, if I might, I'd like to reject some of the premises in your question. One, you said that-incomplete declaration. Well, we are in the process of determining whether or not North Korea did make an incomplete declaration. And if they did, they will remain the most highly sanctioned nation. One thing is for certain, is they did collapse their cooling tower on the plant that had been used to manufacture plutonium. I mean, that is a complete declaration, at least of that aspect of what they said- when they said they would dismantle-or disable and then dismantle. And so we have got-you know, there is a process. Things are going on. I guess we live in a world where everything is supposed to be instant, but I repeat to you: This is a first step of a multiple step process, just so everybody understands. Secondly, we conducted multilateral diplomacy in Iraq-oh, yes-1441 at the United Nations Security Council-the world came together and said, disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences, in a unanimous vote. Now, my speech to the United Nations took place in September, early September of 2002. I do not know if you remember the debate during that summer. It was, Will Bush go to the U.N. Security Council, or will this be a unilateral move without it? -going to this world body. I think some might have been old enough to have covered that story here. And the answer was, I did go to the U.N. Security Council. We did conduct multilateral diplomacy, and the world was supportive of saying to Saddam Hussein, disclose, disarm, or face serious-and he made the choice. He was the one who got to make the choice because he-you know, he defied the world. And so I have always said that diplomacy has got to be the first choice of solving any of these problems. But military options remain on the table, and they remain on the table for these three issues you discussed. I happen to believe multilateral diplomacy is the most effective way to solve some of these very difficult problems, because there needs to be more than one voice in saying the same thing. Because in the past, if you are there alone and you say something and then the leader basically rattles people's cages or makes them nervous, guess who the world rushes to? Not to the person rattling the cage; it rushes to, in this case, the United States: Fix it, get him what he wants. And it did not solve the problem. Now, I understand sometimes people love process, so everybody feels good, you know. But that is not what I-this administration is trying to solve problems. And the best way to solve the problem in North Korea was to have others at the table along with us. And same with the Iranians. Now, this has been difficult to get there to be a focused message because some are worried about market share. You know, the message to the Iranians is, verifiably suspend your enrichment program, and there is a better way forward. And by the way, in 2003, it looked like we were in the process of convincing the Iranians to verifiably suspend their enrichment program. And the United States was working with our partners in Europe, sending a message that you can end your isolation. And then Ahmadi-nejad came along and changed the tone and changed the- evidently, changed the policy of the Government. And so now Iran is much more confrontational. But our message has not changed: Verifiably suspend your enrichment program, and there is a better way forward. So there are carrots, and there are sticks. We are working hard to make sure that the sticks mean something. And I have been pleased by the U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been issued by our friends in the United Nations Security Council in a way that says to the Iranians, we are serious about your change of policy. The choice is theirs. We have made our choice. Now, one thing that is interesting-I think I will -you find this interesting, at least you will play like it is interesting-is this: Should the Iranian regime-so I am the guy who just talked about nuclear power, right? Should the Iranian regime-do they have the sovereign right to have civilian nuclear power? So, like, if I were you, that is what I'd ask me. And the answer is, yes, they do. And I have said so publicly time and time again. But they do not have the right, as far as the U.N. Security Council, for example, goes, to enrich, because they have not told the truth about their program; therefore, they cannot be trusted with enrichment. After all, enriching uranium is a step toward having a nuclear weapon. So we worked with the Russians. Vladimir Putin and I worked on-and he took the lead on this issue, for which I am grateful. So he goes to the Iranians and says, we will provide enriched uranium for you. You have a sovereign right-Bush has said you have a sovereign right to have nuclear power. But because you have defied the IAEA in the past, we will provide enriched uranium for you, and we will collect the enriched uranium; therefore, you do not need to enrich. And if you insist on enriching, it must mean you want a weapon. And so multilateral forums enable people to come up with those kinds of tactics that are effective. And so you bet, the multilateral forum is the best way to solve this peacefully. Okay, guys. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as-oh, you want to ask more questions? I am sure you do. Well, that is generally what happens with one of these things. Okay, you better hurry-- Quick, move to Afghanistan. Japan has been providing the support-support to multilateral force, including United States, in Indian Ocean, to support Afghanistan. But the law that enables maritime Japanese force to do that will expire in July. Next July. Next July. A year from now. Yes, next July. Right. And so-- And U.S. has been-- We were very pleased that they renewed the law. And Secretary Gates has been asking to either extend or even enhance, like sending helicopters, CH-47s to Afghanistan. And I was wondering whether you can explain to the Japanese why such upgraded participation in the war in Afghanistan serves the interests of Japan, apart from simply meeting the expectation of the United States? Because when Al Qaida- forces like Al Qaida have a safe haven to attack friends and allies, or Japan itself, it is a danger to peace. And as for the Japanese contribution, we are very grateful for what we have, and we appreciate the Government getting the current extension through the Parliament. And we, of course, will work with our allies to determine whether or not an enhanced presence could be useful. And if the Government can support that, fine. But I just want you to know how grateful I am for the contribution, as well as the humanitarian contributions. It also ought to make the Japanese people feel good to know that they are helping young girls go to school, or they are helping people get their food to market. Does it matter? Yes, it matters, if you care about the human condition. So the contribution has been great. Got another question? If not, I will applaud you. Japan-U.S. Relations/Nippon Professional Baseball Yes, I have a very personal question, so-- A very what kind? On the history, for-- Personal, yes. During your Presidency, the Japan-U.S. relationship was very strong. But there are still unresolved issues on-regarding Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. And some historians propose that the Prime Minister should visit Pearl Harbor and U.S. ENTITY should visit Hiroshima. That is interesting. What do you think about this? My attitude is, is that I- look, this was a painful period in our respective histories. After all, my father, for example, was a young Navy fighter pilot at war with Japan. But my experience has been very different, because one of my best friends was Prime Minister Koizumi. Is not that interesting? And one reason why is because we put the past behind us and focused on the future. And symbolic gestures like that may make sense. I do not know. I have not really thought about it. It is an interesting idea. You are the first person that is ever brought it up to me, I want you to know. But whoever the next President is must, one, understand the importance of the relationship, and two, be thinking about the future, because we share values; we have got a lot of work to do. We have had interesting economic relationships throughout our history. As you know, I believe in open markets, free and fair trader. That, to me, if I were somebody living in Japan, I'd say, well, there is a fellow who has put the past behind him and is focusing on what is in the best interests of both countries. So it is an interesting suggestion. This will be-it will not work for me; this is my last trip to Japan as President. Supposed to never say never, but I-let me just-I predict this is my last trip to Japan. And I am not saying I am happy about it. So is anybody going to ask me about Bobby Valentine? You do not even know who Bobby Valentine is. He was the old coach of the Rangers who is a manager of one of the Japanese baseball teams, and he is done very well in Japan. People like Bobby, do not they? Yes. Yes, he is -last time I was in Japan, Bobby was there at the airport with Mr. Oh. Oh. The Babe Ruth of Japanese baseball. Oh, yes, that is right. Okay? Got anything, Hiroki? Yes, please. You are the guy who thought of it. On China? China, yes. See how generous I am to give you all these questions? Okay, keep moving. Actually, I would like to ask you what is your view on current relations between U.S. and China? Because 7 years ago, U.S. military plane was forced to land on Hainan Island. That is right, yes. And then I would like to ask you, then, how you see the evolution of the China-U.S. relationship since then? And also, there is some concern in Japan that future of Asian--U.S. and China will jointly manage the stability and prosperity. How do you see-- First of all, the cornerstone of U.S. policy is good, strong relations with Japan. So, as far as the Bush administration goes, that has been our policy, and we have acted on it. That is not to say we cannot have good relations with China, nor Japan can have good relations-I mean, Japan should have good relations with China. And we expect Japan to work hard to have good relations with Japan, just like Japan ought to hope that we have good relations with China, which we do. Our relations are strong, and some say, have never been better. I will let the experts judge that. And one reason why is, we have managed some difficult issues together. The Taiwan Straits issue is a difficult issue, and it looks like it is in a much better spot. I have worked hard to have a good personal relationship with Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, his predecessor, so I can speak frankly to them. And my big concerns about China are religious freedoms and individual rights and political freedoms. Every time I have met with the Chinese leader, which has been a lot, I have had a very frank and open dialogue, and yet been able to maintain a good, cordial relationship so we can work through problems. One such problem is no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. We have got big economic relations with China, as does Japan. And so I do not view the world as zero-sum. In other words, if you got a good relationship, strong relationship, you cannot have a good relationship with China. Quite the contrary, in good foreign policy and good diplomacy, a good relations with one makes it easier to have a better relations with another country. And that is how we have conducted our policy. China is a very interesting issue for all of us. Right now they are dealing with trying to get their economy such that people in the rural parts of their country are able to benefit. And it is a challenge. And they are using a lot of raw materials, and one reason why it is important for Japan and the United States to help them develop the technologies that make them less dependent upon some of these raw materials-that have affected worldwide price of raw materials. And so it is a-it will be a very interesting issue for future Presidents, but we have been able to manage it very well. Thank you. Yell your name. I'd like to ask about the Presidential election. Yes, I do not talk about it, Kenji. The American people are going to get to pick. I am for McCain, if that is what you want to know. --Presidential election and U.S. foreign policy. I like a persistent guy. Keep going. Yes, thank you very much. So with one candidate who supports your foreign policy and another who sharply criticizes it, so how do you think this election will affect the rest of the world? The rest of the world? Yes. You know, I am -that is a good question. I am for John McCain because I think he will do a better job on foreign policy and domestic policy. But, Kenji, you know, I really am not going to spend a lot of time opining about the current election. The American people will filter it out. It is very early in the election cycle. This fall is really when the campaign begins in earnest, the debates, and people start to really focus on it. Right now it is a lot of the pundits and a lot of the pros and experts, some of whom are sitting right behind you, that are-- So do you believe that the next U.S. administration will continue your policy on North Korea? I think whoever gets in the White House will take a look and say, gosh, it makes sense to have other people at the table other than the United States in order to effect good diplomacy. Diplomacy-in order for diplomacy to be effective, it has to be consequential. In other words, when five people say, here is the way forward, and if you choose not to do so, there will be consequences-or if you choose to do so, there will be consequences, it is much more effective than one nation sitting there saying, please change your habits. And so I-you know, I am going to leave it to the candidates. They will have to make up their own mind. But at least there is a multilateral forum in which to deal with this problem. Hopefully, it is progressed a long way down the road by the time whoever comes in the Oval Office. We are pushing forward on an action for action, verifiable-and by the way, the next stage of this, just so everybody is comfortable, there will be a verifiable-a verification regime in place, so that, to answer your question, it will be less speculation and more transparency. Thank you, sir. ENTITY. Another economic question? You must be the most excellent expert on oil business. Yes. Look where our price is. Well, actually, I am suffering high gas prices. You are? Every day. Yes, you are. So what can you do to curb energy inflation? Yes, a couple of things: One is you either just-this is pure economics. You will understand this better than anybody here. You either increase the supply of something or decrease the demand of something in order to affect price- down. The habits of the United States consumer is beginning to change because people are now-they do not like four-dollar gasoline. I can understand why they do not like four-dollar gasoline. People are now looking for smaller cars. That takes a while, however, to change. I fully understand that. But demand is beginning to shift in our country. And in order to affect worldwide demand, it seems like all of us-Japan, the United States, and others at the G-8-need to convince some of the people coming to the G-8 to stop subsidizing their consumers or at least reduce the subsidies somewhat so that there is some effect on demand. Price cannot affect demand if people's habits are subsidized by state enterprise or the state. Secondly, the strategy on energy has got to be twofold, at least from the United States perspective: One, spend money and come up with technologies. That will mean we have to use less gasoline, therefore- in automobiles, for example-less gasoline and, therefore, take the demand off of crude oil. And I mentioned one such technology that I thought was interesting for me to mention it, recognizing the ascendancy of the Japanese technology in the battery market. I have spent a lot of time on this issue, and I think people would say that the Japanese autos and the Japanese R&D is very advanced on battery technologies, which is good. People say, well, does not that upset you? And my answer is, absolutely not. I am interested in technology and technological breakthroughs, and I am pleased that our friends-the investment that this Government and the private sector has made is hopefully going to pay off soon. It is beneficial to the world. And the high price is going to spur a lot of investment. That is what I have explained to the main suppliers of crude oil. So when I went to Saudi Arabia, I said, this high price is hurting your consumers, your customers, and it is going to cause a lot of research and development to diversify away as fast as possible, which is what is happening. In the meantime, we better transition to this period. In other words, evidently our Congress must have thought that there will be instant technology on the market because they prevented us, since 2001, from exploring for known oil and gas reserves that we can do in environmentally friendly ways. And now all of a sudden the price got high enough where the American people are now beginning to hear that message, and I hope the Democrat leaders in Congress hear it, which is, you know, allow this new technology be deployed to find new reserves. And the sooner we do this the better. And it will certainly affect- at the very minimum, affect the psychology of the world, to see that new supplies of crude oil could be coming on the market in the United States. So that is our strategy: technologies and, in the meantime, find more oil here at home. And there is more oil to be found. And I can assure you, Japan wishes they had these reserves, you know, and you'd be finding them. And you would not be hamstrung by politicians refusing to allow this to go forward. Last question, on Iraq. What is your evaluation about where Iraq is now? Do you think now if the U.S. can afford to withdraw more troops from Iraq, or will you leave that decision to the next administration? What is your assessment on war on terror in general, during your two terms? Well, thank you. Let me make sure I get-this is the old three-part question, and I am about to be 62 years old, so-. By the way, I will be celebrating my birthday on Japanese soil. That is interesting. Congratulations. Yes, come to the party. It is not going to be much of a party, it is only 62. Let us see, Iraq and troops. Okay. First of all, there was-the people have-okay, you got to have benchmarks. I think there was 15 benchmarks-18 benchmarks. And one way to evaluate progress is to measure what is actually happened to what was expected. And the progress is undeniable. What happened was security was such that the politics and the economics could move forward. And for a period of time, that was not the case. That is why we sent more troops in. The combat brigades of the surge will finally come home. The last one will be home in July. So we are in a policy of return on success. I will listen to General Petraeus when he returns in September as to whether or not we can achieve our objective with fewer troops. That is up to our commanders. In other words, I am not going to run a poll during the political season, or any time, to determine what is the best policy. The policy is determined by the considered judgment of our commanders. And my hope is the next President will have that same standard. That is going to be up to that person to make the right judgments. In terms of the war on terror, step one is to recognize we are at war. Some in our country do not believe we are at war. If you do not believe we are at war, that this is a simple law enforcement matter, then what you do is you wait until something happens and then react. You know, law enforcement is, there is an action, there is a crime, and then there-law enforcement acts. In war, what you do is you prevent the enemy from hitting in the first place. That is why Iraq and Afghanistan are very important theaters in the war on terror. People- some think these are separate wars. It is the same war against ideologues who murder the innocent to achieve their political objectives. These are just different fronts in the same war. And you know, I am not surprised that a lethal enemy pushes back through the use of their indiscriminate violence to stop the advance of free societies, because this is an ideological war. When they see freedom on the march, it frightens them and it worries them to the point where they kill innocent people to try to shake the will of the people in that country and to shake the will of those trying to help them. And so, one, we have taken on the enemy, and two, we have had good success against Al Qaida. The first and second person is still alive, but the number-three person in Al Qaida has had a dangerous existence- Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al-Libi, a series of leaders. And we are pressuring them today, and we will keep pressuring them. And my hope is, whoever the next President- understands this is a war, and that we cannot relax. And that there is an enemy that wants to do free people harm, and that we have an obligation as free societies to keep the pressure, not only for our own security, but for the security of others. This is back to this man's question down here about, why should we care about Afghanistan? The answer is, is because safe haven is a risk. But there is also another answer. That is one of the great lessons of our relationship. You know, I marvel at the fact, and I talk about it a lot to the American people, of the irony about Prime Minister Koizumi and my relationship. It is a great testament to our respective countries and the transformative power of liberty that my dad fought the Japanese, and his son sits at the peace table with the Japanese leaders in a spirit of respect and friendship and common values. Anyway, thank you. Enjoyed it. Thank you very much. Very good questions.

{"id": 508, "text": "Well, I sure appreciate you joining us. Glad to do it. I guess you folks down in Washington are officially in the thick of the budget battle. Your reaction to the rescission package just passed by the House was that it favors pork over people, and you promised a veto. Republicans are saying they are outraged. How comfortable are you with the prospect that your role may be shaping up more and more to be a blocker of action rather than an initiator? Well, I do not want to block action. I have offered even more spending cuts than is in their bill. This is not about cutting spending, and they know it. I worked in good faith with the Republican majority in the Senate to shape a rescission bill that would be better for the American people and would still cut spending. For example, I worked with the Senate to add back some of the money in the LIHEAP program, which goes to States like New Hampshire to help older people with their utility bills, but we cut spending somewhere else. So we had an agreement that I would go along with this bill, and we worked in good faith. Then the Senate and the House Members went behind closed doors when nobody was looking and remember, this is not a partisan issue members of both parties put a lot of pork in the bill and took a billion and a half dollars in education funding out. Now, correct And so let me just finish so all I told them was, I am all for it, cutting this much spending. Indeed, I think we should cut a little more spending. I offered another $100 million in spending cuts. But I do not believe if we are going to balance this budget and cut back on Government spending, then we need to be very careful about how we spend the money we do spend. We ought to target it to education. We ought to target it to things that will raise incomes and grow jobs in America and improve the security of the American people. Instead, they took out money to make our schools safer and more drug-free. They took out money to fund college educations for young people who are working in their community in the national service program that is received broad bipartisan support in New Hampshire. They instead, they put in $100 million for a courthouse. They put in even more road projects into a Congressman's district who now has nine special-purpose road projects in his district. They even put in a million dolllars for a city street in a State in the Midwest where the mayor did not ask for the money. Now, that is what was done behind closed doors. That is the old politics. If we are going to change things around here, we have got to move away from the old politics, cut unnecessary spending, and then when we do spend money, the money ought to be well spent. We should not be trading in pork for people, behind closed doors. That is what we did, and it was wrong. And I want to change that. But I am all for the spending cuts. Now, it is my impression that the only new spending in the House bill is disaster relief, antiterrorism laws, and Oklahoma City aid. You originally signed on to items that you are now calling pork, such as the highway construction and That is right. That is when we had a that is right. But that is when we were spending more money. But let us just let us look at the real facts. If we are going to cut $16 billion worth of spending, and I signed let me remind you that I signed on to it because the Congress has the ability to put these special projects in there and because I do not have the line-item veto, which the Republicans say they are for and which I have agreed with the Republicans for. Now, they passed the line-item veto in the House, they passed one in the Senate, but they are different. If they had they still have not appointed the conferees to resolve the difference between the House and the Senate. If they had sent me the line-item veto, we would not be having this discussion today. But if you say if they say we want to cut $16 billion and I say we want to cut $16 billion and then we reach an agreement I reached a good-faith agreement with the Senate, and then they go behind closed doors and they say, No, no, no, we do not want to do all this education business; we want some of our pork-barrel projects. So we will cut education a billion and a half and put pork in. Now, that is what happened. If you are going to cut spending, you have to make choices, what you cut and what you keep. If you are going to spend more money, you can spend more money on different things. But I will say again, I think they are wrong to put in pork-barrel projects and cut education. And I do not think they can defend it. And they are not trying to defend it very hard; they are just talking about process. Obviously, nobody's saying we do not need deficit reduction. The question seems to be how, and how fast? Do you consider yourself at odds with those who are determined to actually balance the budget by the year 2002? Well, I am first of all, I am not certainly not at odds with those who are determined to balance the budget by a date certain. And I invited the Congress to do what the law required them to do and submit a budget and then to work it through. They are now in the process of working through that budget. I want to evaluate it, and then I would including the date. But I think we have to balance the budget. I think we have to do it by a date certain, and I agree with that. And I think we ought to do it in a bipartisan fashion. And I will support them. They have not had let me just point out I am prepared to work with them to reduce the deficit and to bring the budget into balance. For 2 years, for 2 years, they said no to all my efforts to get them to work with me. So we reduced the deficit 3 years in a row for the first time since Harry Truman, with nobody helping us in the other party, none of them. And they were all saying we were going to have a big recession, and it would wreck the economy. A lot of those people who are up there in New Hampshire running for ENTITY said, If President Clinton's budget passes, it will wreck the economy. Well, New Hampshire had a 7.6 percent unemployment rate when I became ENTITY, and it is 4 1/2 percent today. You have got almost 40,000 new jobs, and in the previous 4 years you lost over 40,000 jobs. So they were wrong. So now they believe in deficit reduction. And I say, welcome to the party, I am glad to have you here, and I will work with you on it. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. And if we are going to cut spending more quickly, I will support that. But that means that the money that is left, the money we do spend, has to be spent even more carefully. I think people in New Hampshire will really identify with that. If you are going to spend if you spent $10 yesterday and you are going to spend $8 today, then you have got to be more careful about how you spend the $8. That is my argument over this rescission package. If they will take the pork out and put the people back, I will sign even more deficit reduction than they have. I understand. Finally, Granite Staters are by no stretch of the imagination a tax-friendly bunch. But according to surveys, we are in step with the rest of the country in preferring deficit reduction to tax cuts. Are you determined to stick to fulfilling your long-delayed promise to cut taxes on the middle class even though it would set back the pace of deficit reduction? Because I would think if you back away from tax cuts, you'd be opening yourself up to more attacks that once again you have not done what you'd say you would. Well, first of all, let us look at what I did do, before we get all carried away here. Let us look at what we let us look at what we did do. In 1993, we cut taxes for lower middle income working families with children an average, this year, of $1,000 a family, for working people with incomes of $27,000 a year or less. We have already done that. We also cut taxes for 90 percent of the small businesses in America that increased their investments in their own business. So we did do that while reducing the deficit. Do I believe that we can bring the budget into balance within the next few years and still have a tax cut? I do, but not one the size that the House of Representatives has adopted. You cannot , you cannot cut taxes as much as the House has and balance the budget. It will not happen. And it is not right, frankly, to cut taxes in ways that largely benefit upper income people and to pay for it by cutting Medicare and Medicaid to the elderly and disabled. When I was in New Hampshire 4 years ago, I met people who were already making a decision every week between buying drugs and paying for food. We do not want to make that worse. So my answer to you is, if we have a targeted tax cut that focuses on the middle class and rewards education and childrearing, we can do that and we can afford to do that in the context of deficit reduction. But we cannot afford a big, broad-based, huge tax cut in the magnitude that the House passed and balance this budget without doing severe damage to the elderly of this country, including the elderly people in New Hampshire. And do I understand you correctly that you are not prepared at this point to set a date for balancing the budget, a year? No, but I can say this. I think it can be done Well, it can first of all, it can be done in 7 years. The question is, what is the penalty, and what are the tradeoffs? I think it clearly can be done in less than 10 years. I think we can get there by a date certain. But I want to evaluate the actual budget that the Republicans finally agree on. That is, the Senate has to adopt their budget proposal. Then they will get together and reconcile the differences. Then I have to do what I promised them I did; I promised them that if they would adopt a budget, that I would negotiate with them in good faith and that I would propose a counter-budget. That is what I I gave them my word I'd do it, and I will do it. I owe that to them, and I owe it to the American people. Look, I believed in deficit reduction before they did. My budgets, adopted in the last 2 years, are giving us 3 years of deficit reduction for the first time since Mr. Truman was President. And had it not been for the debts run the interest we have to pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I came to town, we would have a balanced budget today. That is, the only reason for the deficit today is the interest we are paying on the debt run up between 1981 and the end of 1992. And both parties bear responsibility for that because in every year but one, the Congress, then in the hands of the Democrats, actually adopted less spending than the White House, then in the hands of the Republicans, asked for. So this is not a partisan issue with me. America has a vested interest in the future in bringing this deficit down and bringing the budget into balance. And I will work with them to do it. And yes, it can be done, and it can be done by a date certain. Okay.ENTITY, thank you very much for taking the time to talk with us. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpetermalofnewhampshirepublicradio", "title": "Interview With Peter Malof of New Hampshire Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-peter-malof-new-hampshire-public-radio", "publication_date": "19-05-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 183, "text": "Well, thank you ENTITY for seeing us today. Absolutely Would you assess the budget and deficit talks for us right now? Are you close to a deal? Well, I think we are moving in the right direction. As I have said consistently, we have to raise the debt ceiling so that we preserve the full faith and credit of the United States of America. But we also have to solve the underlying problem which is we have been spending more money than we have been taking in and that is creating debt deficits and debt that date back to 2000. The last time we had a balanced budget was when Bill Clinton was president. And so what I have said is we need a balanced approach, we have got to cut spending that is unnecessary, we have got to eliminate waste and fraud and abuse, but we also have to make sure we have got revenues to pay for things like student loan programs, make sure that our seniors are taken care of, and yesterday what we saw was Republican senators along with Democratic senators in a bipartisan way both saying that we need to cut spending, including on some entitlement programs, but we also have to add more revenues. And that kind of balanced approach I think offers a way out of this dilemma and hopefully stabilizing the economy in a way that will help us create jobs here in America. Let us move to the economy for a moment here, Ohio's economy in particular. Manufacturing helped build our state. What do you do to revive that part of our economy in Ohio when those jobs continue to fade away? Well, I have to say the recovery has been obviously slower than we would like and we are doing everything we can to accelerate hiring. Manufacturing has actually been a bright spot in this recovery. We have actually seen more growth faster in manufacturing than in the rest of the economy. Now part of that is the work that we did in the auto industry, which is obviously very important to Ohio. We were about to see the liquidation of Chrysler and GM, they have come roaring back, they are now making a profit; they are actually increasing market share. Part of it is restructuring and better management but part of it is also starting to look at what are the products of the future? How can we build cars that are fuel efficient, how can we win the race for electric cars? And so this whole area of advanced manufacturing where we focus on the products that we are going to be using in the 21st century rather than in the 19th or 20th century, that is how we can create more and more manufacturing jobs and we are putting a lot of investment in that particularly on the research and development side where the federal government can do some things that typically the private sector is not going to do and I will give you one example: Advanced battery manufacturing, the batteries that are used in electric cars, we have gone from a two-percent share of the worldwide market now to 30, 40 percent potentially over the next five years of the worldwide market. And those are all good paying jobs in Ohio, in Michigan in areas that have traditionally had a outstanding manufacturing track-record. You know how important Ohio was to your election, what is your strategy to win the state over in 2012? You know, I am not thinking about elections I am thinking about all the families that I hear back from in Ohio and across the country who are, you know, struggling, maybe a spouse has lost a job, they used to have two paychecks, now they got one, trying to make ends meet. Their housing situation has not stabilized so they still have mortgages that may be worth or higher than what the house is worth. You know, young people who are trying to figure out how to afford college, so that is what motivates me on a day to day basis and my attitude is that if we are taking the right steps to improve our education system, if we are rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges and putting people back to work, especially construction workers who've been laid off, if we are getting our fiscal house in order, if we are investing in research and development for the kind of advanced manufacturing we just talked about, and the economy's growing, then politics will take care of itself. And that is going to be true in Ohio, that is going to be true across the country. You nominated Richard Cordray earlier this week. Senate Republicans say they will fight that nomination unless you can make the bureau more transparent and accountable, is there room for compromise to win his nomination? Well, first of all, let us dispel this notion that somehow this agency is not accountable or transparent, it is completely transparent and completely accountable. It is working for consumers. The idea here is that we are going for the first time have a consolidated agency who is only job is to make sure that consumers are not getting ripped off when it comes to applying for mortgages, applying for credit cards, any financial transaction, they are not having to wade through a bunch of fine print finding that their interest rates are getting jacked up after they have already signed an agreement, and Rich Cordray is a perfect candidate for this job. This is a guy who was one of the first on the scene in terms of dealing with this foreclosure mess where it turns out that a lot of services and mortgages were not abiding by the law when it came to foreclosing people's homes, he has championed consumer protections in Ohio, he is been the treasurer of Ohio as well, you have got a lot of Republicans in Ohio who complimented the job that he did as a balanced thoughtful consumer advocate. And that is exactly what we need. So what we have had is a situation where some in the financial industry have been sending lobbyists and lawyers up to Capitol Hill spending millions of dollars to try to water down this agency. We are not going to let it be watered down because it was actually some of these abuses, for example in the sub-prime lending market, that helped create the financial crisis that led to the massive recession that we suffered and we do not want to go through that again and every American should know that they have got somebody standing behind them, protecting them from the kinds of financial abuse that we have seen in the past. There is still a lot of frustration from people continuing to wait for that change that you promised, they do not feel better off now than they were 3 years ago. How do you convince them we are headed in the right direction? Well, look there is no doubt that we have gone through the toughest economic situation that we have seen since the Great Depression. I think the vast majority of people understand that this is something that we inherited and that when I came into office we'd already lost 4 million jobs and the few months after I got sworn in we lost another 4 million. We have created 2 million jobs, over 2 million jobs in the private sector over the last 15 months, the problem is that we got in such a big hole right at the start there in 2009 and we are still digging our way back. But what I think the American people want to know is there is a game plan for the future and what we have said is, if we are getting our fiscal house in order, if we are investing in the infrastructure of the future, not just roads and bridges but also broadband lines and a smart grid that makes sure that we do not waste energy, if we are developing a clean-energy and alternative energy future for ourselves so that we are not dependent on foreign oil, if we are making sure that every one of our kids is the best educated in the world so that they can compete in this new world economy, if we take those basic steps, I am absolutely confident that America's going to not just bounce back but we will be stronger than ever, what people want to know is that we are moving in the right direction even if they are frustrated with how fast we are moving, we need to speed it up but I think the trajectory's a good one.

{"id": 195, "text": "ENTITY, welcome to Davos. Thank you very much. Thank you for agreeing to come on CNBC and Squawk Box. I appreciate it. I have known you a long time. You have known me a long time. And we have done many of these, but a little bit different position. I was a developer. Little bit different position few more people around, too. Couple of more people. So, the America First president comes to Davos. And you know, when you say Davos you know what a lot of people think: globalists, elitists. What will you say when you address not just the globalists and the elitists, but everyone? When you address them, what will be your message? So when I decided to come to Davos I did not think in terms of elitists or globalists. I think I thought in terms of lots of people that want to invest lots of money, and they are all coming back to the United States, they are coming back to America. And I thought of it much more in those terms. After I said that I was going there were massive stories about the elite, and the globalists, and the planes flying in, and everything else. It is not about that. It is about coming to America, investing your money, creating jobs, companies coming in. We are setting records every week, every day we are setting records. You see what is going on. Apple now with $350 billion. Most people thought they meant $350 million, which would build a nice plant. But I spoke with Tim Cook and I was very honored. But you remember my campaign, I used to say, I will not consider this great unless Apple starts coming in and really investing big money doing the plants. They are gonna do a lot. You have moved a little but so many companies are coming in and so many jobs Yes. You have moved a little towards the center. But so Macron's saying that globalism does not solve problems. Suddenly other countries are saying, you know, We need to take care of, you know, our own country to some extent. So it is almost like the differences between America First and Davos. I think there is plenty of room for you There is a lot of room. And we love global, but we love home. We have to take care of our home. Right. It is not usually exclusive. Now, we have the disadvantage of having spent, as of about a month ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East. $7 trillion. That is a big disadvantage. And we are still there, and I have beaten ISIS, I have done we have done a good job. But it is such a shame. It is such a sad, sad thing. Let me tell you about the difference of Davos this year. Go ahead. We have done three three-hour shows, we have about eight guests per hour, so that is , like, 50 or 60 guests. Right. They are more optimistic this year and there is global growth. Sure. But the one thing most are bringing up and then I want to tell you about if you did not see the Jamie Dimon and the Lloyd Blankfein interview, I want to just tell you what they said about the potential for GDP growth Good. Good. Because those guys might know what they are talking about. But the tax plan has been brought up almost without exception in a positive way by not just the CEOs, but by leaders from other countries even. They maybe they need to look at maybe they need to invest in the United States now because it is a better environment for business. And that is why I am here. To a large extent, that is why I am here. I think that the tax plan has been even better than we thought, ENTITY. What did happen that nobody considered is that AT&T started, but they immediately followed Same day almost. Hundreds of companies are giving thousands and thousands of dollars to their workers. And now you have almost 3 million workers that are receiving thousands of dollars. Nobody ever thought that was not, like, in the plan Even Starbucks. Even Starbucks Yeah, even Starbucks, yesterday Disney and others. I mean So Dimon said By the way, the ones that are not doing it, those employees are going like, How about us? Guess what? They are gonna be doing it, too. Go ahead. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, I know you know him. Not only did he say he thought 3 percent was possible, he said we could get to 4 percent in 2018. Lloyd Blankfein, and I pressed him a little because I said, That was not the outcome the election that you were, I think, hoping for. Now that you have seen what is happened to the stock market, up 40 percent since Election Day, how businesses are growing confidence, are you happy with the outcome? And he said he could not really say, I am happy with the outcome, but he did say No. I do not think they cannot do that. but no, but he did. He cannot do it But he said It is OK. But no, but he said, I do not think the stock market would be where it is, I do not think GDP would be where it is. Maybe the polarization would be less, but he had to concede that the benefits probably outweighed any of the downside of That was Lloyd? That was Lloyd. And Jamie's become very positive Jamie and Lloyd also said 3 percent is possible long term, which we have not heard from all the economists that supposedly I think it'll be much higher than that. So I said and let us see what happens, because as you know, we are getting a report very soon, so we are going to see what that is. But I just happened to ask what we were doing. Because you know, if you look at the real numbers, had I not won, had the Democrat won I am going to be nice the Democrat, I say, won I would consider their last quarter my first quarter. Because you know, I just got there. So let us say the first quarter of '17 you had a 1.2 GDP. OK? 1.2. In the fourth quarter, which is the Obama quarter, you had a 1.8. Before that, you had a 2.8, a 2.2. You had were not doing very well. And it was the worst recovery I guess do they say ever, or since the Great Depression? But it was the worst recovery. OK. Now, in my first quarter, which I consider to be the second quarter because I was there now long enough to have made an impact and do not kid yourself, regulations are just as big as the tax cuts. I have cut more regulations than any president in history and I have been here for one year. You can take their term whether it is eight years or 16 years in one instance but you can take anybody you want, in one year, we have cut more regulations. And by the way, there is going to be regulation but they are good, solid, sane regulations. But in quarter two, we had 3.1, and in quarter three, as you know, we had 3.2. But in quarter one, which is the Obama quarter really the last, I would say, Obama quarter, you had 1.2. We were going in the wrong direction. Right. There was the hurricane. Had the Democrat won the stock market is up almost 50 percent since my election had the Democrat won, I believe you would have been down 50. That is the direction we were headed. And you know, a lot of that, regulation. It was staggering. You could not do anything. You could not build I approved immediately the two pipelines, 48,000 jobs Right. Can we talk about the year? Yes. So the year, all these things that you have pointed out. But you have been dealing, negotiating now in government instead of in the private sector. And it is been I think lovingly referred to as the swamp by certain Yeah. It is difficult. Is it difficult? And have you learned are you approaching it differently now? Would you give your what would you give yourself in terms of dealing, negotiating with the government versus business? What grade for the first year? Well, a lot of people have given me an A. Somebody gave me an A-plus. So look, I got the biggest tax plan in our history approved. And do not forget, not just a tax plan. Have you learned anything? I got rid of the Would you do anything different now? ENTITY, one second. I got rid of the individual mandate, the most the biggest part and the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, which really repeals Obamacare, because it cannot live without the mandate, because that is where a lot of the money came. It was very unfair to people. And we did ANWR . ANWR, Ronald Reagan tried to do it 40 years ago. I mean, everybody's been trying to do ANWR, and I got ANWR done as part of that same bill. So on top of the biggest tax cuts, great reform and the money is coming in. I mean, the money is pouring in. We probably take in $4 trillion from overseas that would never have been able to be here because of regulation. Well, can we talk trade real quickly while we are doing it. And taxes. Yeah. So we had solar panels, washing machines. I am not sure where it goes from here. Yeah. I am not sure how China reacts, whether steel's next Whatever it is. You will they are grown-ups and I think they understand that maybe we had some It is time We have some legitimate right. Would you you going to stick with bilateral or would you ever go back in the multi would TPP, would that ever be possible to look at that again? I like bilateral because if you have a problem, you terminate. When you are in with many countries, like with TPP so you have 12 if we were in you do not have that same, you know, you do not have that same option. But somebody asked me other day would I do TPP. Here is my answer. I will give you a big story. I would do TPP if we made a much better deal than we had. We had a horrible deal. The deal was a horrible deal. NAFTA's a horrible deal, we are renegotiating it. I may terminate NAFTA, I may not. We will see what happens. But NAFTA was and I went around and I'd tell stadiums full of people, I will terminate it or renegotiate it. So you might re-enter are you opening up the door to reopening TPP? Or I am only saying this: I would do TPP if we were able to make a substantially better deal. The deal was terrible. The way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal I would be open to TPP. That is interesting. Would you handicap Are you surprised to hear me say that? I am a little bit, yeah. I am a little taken aback Do not be surprised, no. But we have to make a better deal I want to know The deal was a bad deal, like the Iran deal is a bad deal You said but NAFTA, maybe not NAFTA These are bad deals. Can you give me any indication which way you are leaning? Because there is a lot of people, lot of the CEOs that have been on here, they all seem to acknowledge that it is 30 years later and there is a lot of changes that make a lot of sense, but to not abandon the deal. We Hey ENTITY, we have a trade deficit with Mexico. Mexico, $71 billion a year, right? We have a trade deficit with Canada of a substantial amount of money. I have a number but they keep arguing, they keep saying no so I will not say it. I will not tell you it is $17 million, OK? We have a trade deficit with Canada. We have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. Got to do something. We cannot continue to do this Are you leaning towards staying in or would you really go out of the I have always said during the campaign and as you noticed and as you have actually said a couple of times, which I have always appreciated, I have fulfilled a lot of what I have said. And I am only here a year. You know, I think I have four years and maybe another four years, OK, if we keep going So what we will see We will see what happens. But ENTITY, we have a $71 billion a year trade deficit with Mexico. We got to do something. We cannot have that. So will it be renegotiated? We are trying right now with Bob Lighthizer and the whole group. I think we have a good chance but we will see what happens. The way that the shutdown finally was, you know, was ended. Yeah. I get the feeling that Senator Schumer is taking a lot of flak from his flank, from the far-left flank. So I feel like he is been burnt, which makes me worry about when we go back. In two weeks He made a mistake in shutting down. He should not have shut down. People of this country want security, they want safety, they want their military to be taken care of. What is going to happen on Monday with DACA? What are you willing to go further to the Well, we have already started the process Will you stay with Cotton or will you move further to what I think Cotton, and Perdue and Goodlatte, and the people that I have been dealing with Cornyn, so many of the people these are great people. These are people that really have shifted a lot. They have really shifted a lot, and I think they are willing to shift more, and so am I. You said 10n to 12 years for citizenship, right, for the Dreamers. Will Cotton go along with that? We are going to see. If we make the right deal. I think they will. These are people that have very strong opinions on DACA and on immigration generally. And I happen to think they are largely right. Look, we are going to try and make a deal on DACA. We have a good chance of making it. What we need is we need the wall, we need security, we need security at the border. We have to stop the drugs from coming in. We need safety and we need a strong military. You want We need almost more than ever before I mean, we have been in wars so we needed it then but we need to be sure that our military is properly funded, and it would be really great to get rid of the, you know, we'd like to have a regular budget. Will you ask for $25 billion, ENTITY? Is that We are asking and did Chuck Schumer offer $1.6 billion? We agreed to $25 billion Did he take it back? Did he Yeah, sure. He took it back but, you know, that is Did he how much did he agree to? But he did not really take it back. If you see numerous senators on the other side they said, We'd give the wall in two minutes if we could do something with DACA. Everybody wants to solve the DACA problem. They have been wanting to solve it for a long time. It should've been solved by President Obama. It would've been easier to solve it, especially when he had the House and the Senate. They could've solved it in a day. But they did not solve it, he did not solve things. And he did something that he did not have the right to do. You understand, he did an executive order and that was no good. And by the way, the court it was not me. The courts were not upholding that executive order. You have to do it through Congress. I want to solve the DACA problem. I will consider that a great achievement to solve the DACA problem. It is been out there for a long time. These are good people, these are people that should be able to stay in this country. We are going to solve the DACA problem. But we also want to solve a tremendous problem on the southern border, which is crime. We need a wall, we need the drugs to stop flowing in. They are coming in like well, they are coming in less now than they were because we have a very strong we have great Border Patrol agents, great ICE we have great people and they are really doing a good job. And you see what is happening at the border, it is much better. But we need a strong border. And to do that you need a wall. And they did agree to a $25 billion wall, of which I will have a lot of money left over. Because I do not need $25 billion to build a wall. We will build a great that is what I do. We will build a great wall and we will have a lot of money left over, and we will spend it on other things. But we need great security. And yes, Senator Perdue, Senator Cotton, Cornyn, this one, that one, we have tremendous support to get something done. Tremendous, ENTITY. And I think something will get done. I want to ask you a Davos question, just because we are here and I do not know, I even get taken over by this. But whenever we are here, we talk about wealth disparity and income inequality, not just globally but everywhere. Big problem. Big problem. A resurgent United States, a strongly growing United States makes a world of difference not just for the United States but for the world in general. But I am just wondering if you did if you were able to keep GDP or if the United States grows at 3 percent or 4 percent and we have the coffers, that we can do a lot with 3 percent or 4 percent. It is totally different than when we do not have money. Different country. Do you have a way of addressing the skills gap and education? As a businessperson, you solve problems. Now you are in government We need vocational schools. We need the community colleges in many cases Will that be something that will Oh, I think it is a big factor for us. But I also want these great companies that are coming in Toyota's now coming in. We talked already about Apple. Apple's coming in with a very big presence. We had many companies Chrysler's coming in, leaving Mexico and coming back to Michigan. I mean, how good is that? When was the last time you heard that? And without me being here and without what we have been doing including regulation, by the way, because I happen to think that regulation is as big as the tax cuts, OK? I think the tax cuts are incredible. But I think the regulations, the cutting of regulations because the businesses could not even they could not do anything. They were totally bound. You'd have to get 16 different approvals from 15 different agencies. Hey ENTITY, it was impossible to do business. And I think you know that maybe better than anybody. The cutting of the regulations was every bit as important as what we did with the tax cuts. But you put them both together and we have a dynamic country again. I mean, everybody's talking. I just came out and some really wonderful people said, Davos has never been like this. This is like walking into the Academy Awards, except we have more photographers. The Journal this morning, lead editorial was that and they gave a lot of credit to the Trump administration for where economic growth is right now. But then they said, Why would a Cabinet member bring up the idea of a weaker dollar when things are going so well? And I am wondering whether you saw Secretary Mnuchin's comments yesterday. Do you agree with those? Were they taken out of context? Where are you So let me tell you, I think they were taken out of context because I read his exact statement. I will tell you where I stand, which ultimately is very important. No. 1, I do not like talking about it because, frankly, nobody should be talking about it. It should be what it is. It should also be based on the strength of the country. We are doing so well, our country is becoming so economically strong again and strong in other ways too, by the way that the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger. And ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar. Right now it floats. But it is your great reserve currency. There can never be anything even close to it. There is nothing close to it, there never will be. But ultimately the dollar, because our country is going to get so much stronger economically, if you look at what is happened to our country over the look, I have been talking about this with you for 25 years. Trade. It started with Japan, morphed into China, now it is China, Japan, it is everybody. And everybody has taken advantage of our country. They have ripped our country off. You look at what they do. I saw something on motorcycles today with a certain country. Why should I say? But they sell motorcycles into our country, no tax. We sell motorcycles into their country Harley-Davidsons, the greatest, right? We sell them into their country, 100 percent tax. Not going to happen. The word reciprocal is the most important word with Donald Trump when it comes to what the subject that we talk about and the subject that CNBC covers so well especially you, by the way, because I do not agree with all of you people, but that is OK. But reciprocal. I want reciprocal. If they are going to charge us 100 percent for a motorcycle, it should be 100 percent the other way, too. And you know, when you mention a tax at the border, a 10 percent tax on the border for everything coming in, I am a free trader. Totally. I am a fair trader. I am all kinds of trader, but I want reciprocal. Because when China's charging us a fortune to send products in and making it impossible for the product to get there and many other countries, by the way, not just China. China's the biggest. And then we charge them nothing to sell their stuff here. It is not fair. When you use the word reciprocal everybody understands that. If they do it to you, you do it to them and everybody understands it, ENTITY. And you are going to see a lot of that in my administration. And you are already seeing it. Well, we are going to have to end it there. I am just last question. Will we have another shutdown? Will you move more to the center on immigration I do not think the Democrats would shut it down again. You do not think they will do it No. Because you look at every poll, it said they made a mistake. Where is the movement going to come? I do not want to say Schumer got badly beaten. Why should I do that? I am negotiating with someone I am not going to say he got badly beaten. But you look at what happened. The people want security and they want DACA taken care of. But more importantly, they want security, they want the borders strong, they want to have a strong border. They do not want to have MS-13 coming into our cities. You know how many of these people were getting out? These are horrible, horrible human beings. And they came here as horrible human beings. And ENTITY, it sounds terrible. They do not shoot somebody, they cut them up into little pieces because it is more painful. I do not want them we are taking them out by the thousands. By the thousands. We do not want them coming in, but we are going to take care of DACA. Nobody wants to take care of DACA more than myself and the Republican Party. And the Republican Party is unified at a level that Paul Ryan called me the other day. He said, I have to tell you, ENTITY, I have been here for a long time and I have been a part of the Republican Party, and I have been watching it for a long time. For many decades I have never seen the Republican Party unified like it is under your presidency. And that that was Paul Ryan. And I thought that was a very nice statement, a very nice statement. And I think Mitch McConnell actually feels the same way. We want to do what is right and we are going to do what is right, and we are going to solve the DACA problem. And I do not think the Democrats would want to pull another shutdown. But we will get it solved. And if we need a little more time, we will take a little more time. I want to get the problem solved correctly. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, ENTITY.

{"id": 464, "text": "You had a whole complement of jogging I know it. They told me that one of the girl on my right that pretty looking she claims to be the 250th in the world in tennis. And she is struggling and trying to it is so wonderful practices 8 hours every day. And she is a pretty on red clay? Yes, on that -- on red clay over there, yes. And then the kids they train for what they call their national games or something there. The one that spoke the English, her dad was a coach in Kuwait. And she learned her English over there, and she is a high-jumper. But anyway, it was fun. a good mood? Good mood. This visit to Hungary well, Poland also but both of them were very, very moving. And I just come away with this real acute sense now of the change that is taking place in Eastern Europe and a determination to play a constructive role in that change. The meetings with these Hungarian leaders the most recent visit were very good, very frank. I have been to, what, 77, 79 countries, or something, as Vice President; and these talks were more than just diplomatic. I mean, you did not rely on the printed card, and they did not . I mean, they spoke right from the heart. They said what they thought; they made clear the difficulties that they were facing. And I tried to do the same thing. There was something very special and warm and personal about the meetings in both Poland and Hungary. Do you think you made a difference? I realize it would not have been diplomatic for any of those leaders to say so, but did you hear any complaints in either place about the sufficiency of the packages you brought? No, and I think you are right: There may be a reason that they would not say so. But I heard none at all, not one. And in fact, Walesa , who had been reported to be asking for $10 billion, moved off of that and said that what they wanted were more banks to come in that would loan those kinds of money. There was a paper written by a Solidarnosc economist that had the figure of $10 billion and had broken it down into x-number of dollars from the World Bank, x from the IMF, x -- and it added up to $10 billion. But there was no pressure of that nature, and then I see that subseQuently Walesa was in the paper today or yesterday saying that there had not been a disappointment. But I think they understand that we are restricted in what we can do in terms of aid, or dollars of support, for some very worthy project. The thing that is impressive is the determination on the part of all these leaders to move towards economic freedom and political freedom. It was so clear in Poland. General Jaruzelski -- who has had an image in the States earlier on that was not a very favorable one -- is really out front in the reforms. And conversations were very warm and very frank with him. We'd talk about differences, but we'd also talk about common objectives. And he went out of his way to be hospitable. And then the same thing on the -- what you'd call the private sector side -- Lech Welesa down there. And the same was true here; we met with the leaders and then, again, the opposition. And then they were all together at a reception. It is -- change is absolutely amazing that is taking place in Eastern Europe. Do you think that you have made a difference? Yes, I do. What do you think that was? Well, I think the very fact that they can sit and talk to an American President in a reasonable way and I could tell them what I thought we would be able to do, how much we shared their desire for change -- I think was fruitful to them. And I think they saw the friendship and respect for the United States from their people -- the crowds on the street and the -- any time there was interaction with the people it was dramatic. And I am sure that makes a difference to the leaders. I think it shores up their desire for change because I think it shows all of us the genuine affection for the United States that exists in these countries and, I would say, in the rest of Eastern Europe, too, although I cannot speak as authoritatively. I have been t Is Poland going to get a government soon? I do not know, Helen, I do not know. I would say yes, but I cannot predict who ENTITY's going to be. Did Walesa seem concerned? We discussed that very openly, but it is just something I cannot predict the outcome. holding them up? Well, I think it takes some time after their elections for the Parliament, and I think that they are now trying to sort out, in an arrangement, who to support for President. And you have got several different options. But that is their business; that is the internal affair of Poland, and I ought not to try to get involved in that. Did Walesa express any concerns about calling upon workers to make the kind of sacrifices required? Because that is another problem area. He did not express concern about that, but I had an opportunity to make clear in private that and publicly that reforms were essential. There is no point going there under false colors and to try to have everything sweetness and light as a message that but it is not going to be easy. But that is part of the message. The rest of it is that change is in the winds, and I sense it so much more clearly from having been there. Do you feel the general I mean, you could see a man almost totally resigned Did I feel what? Do not you feel that the general sees something besides the inevitable? I mean, he seems to have given up. I do not think it is a question of resignation. You see, as you see change take place in the Soviet Union, this opens the way for change vital change, vibrant change in the rest of Eastern Europe. And so, I did not sense a dejection on his part; I sensed somewhat of an upbeat feeling that, yes, that these changes were possible now. And I certainly sense that in Hungary. odd man out? Well, let us wait and see. Do you think your opinions may have encouraged reform in some of the other countries, such as, maybe, Romania or Czechoslovakia or East Germany, or might there be a backlash Well, you want to be careful not to conduct yourself in such a way as to encourage a backlash. But I would think that this visit in the neighborhood would be watched by countries where economic and political change are lagging behind Poland and lagging behind Hungary. That is not true of the Soviet Union, and it is not true of Yugoslavia. But there are other countries that are probably watching and wondering. I am firmly convinced that this wave of freedom, if you will, is the wave of the future. And I would expect that this visit has been watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and, hopefully, giving encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform political change, economic change -- that these other countries are now following. Do you think they will feel that talk is cheap from the United States, and what about a little more aid to encourage their reform movement? I did not sense that. That was their early question, and I did not sense it. I expect everybody would like to have as much aid as everybody possibly can attract. But when you are tying your position into economic reform and incentive and ownership and private sector and entrepreneurship, it seems to have at least negated the public cry or diminished the public cry for more funds. I just did not encounter that. In fact, a couple of them and I will leave their names out of it -- said: We did not expect you to come here with a bag full of money was the way they put it. Are you going to tell the summit leaders that communism is dead? No. I am going to tell them that there is dynamic change taking place in Eastern Europe, and I expect each one of them will want to tell me about their experiences with that. But I want to be sure that they know of our commitment to foster this change in a prudent way. I have not set up any yardsticks for that, Brit . I do not think that there is a way to measure success at an economic summit. I mean, this is not a summit where there is one major problem to be solved. There are problems on the agenda, but I expect at the conclusion of the meeting you will see seven countries in harmony, pulling together on matters like the environment and, you know, the economies of the various countries, and trade. All these are contentious matters bilaterally, but I think we can reach common understanding. So, maybe that would be the yardstick. Gorbachev to what is going on in Eastern Europe approach seems to be development in Eastern Europe and that you are a partner, but a limited partner. Is not it Gorbachev's revolutionary approach to the East-West relationship that has given these people license to move forward? Is not he glad they are moving forward? I would think so, and maybe you missed what I said about Poland and giving them the flexibility to move forward. So, no, I would certainly say, and I mentioned four countries one of them was the Soviet Union. I do not think you were here when I started talking about that. So, we are very pleased to see the perestroika. And let me repeat for the umpteenth time: I want to see it succeed. When are you going to tell him that personally? I do not know. This year? Geneva? No plans for that right now. Do you think it would be useful? I do not think there is any misunderstanding on his part about the position of the United States in terms of his reforms. I think maybe if there is ever any doubt about it those doubts have been dispelled; and if there was any recent doubts about it, those doubts will be dispelled by his friends in Poland and in Hungary because I made very clear to them that, you know, we are not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr. Gorbachev. Just the opposite to encourage the very kind of reforms that he is championing and more reforms. convinced that he understands what you are doing? Because there are so many contacts with him and because some of these leaders told me that. And they told me that in terms of our approach to arms also. There has been some suggestion we were dragging our feet on arms control, which is pure nonsense. And I am convinced from talking to these people that Gorbachev knows that we are serious. Indeed, we have an opportunity now to encourage him to move along faster on conventional force reductions. The idea that some Soviet spokesman yesterday says they cannot meet these timetables I do not want to believe that that is Mr. Gorbachev speaking. And I am not going to believe it until I hear from him or until I hear authoritatively that that is who it is. Should we not believe Marlin? You can believe Marlin, yes, because he speaks with great authority. But this guy was not a -- I do not think it was a press spokesman. It was a It was a lieutenant general that Yes, a lieutenant general. political general. He is a couple of beats behind the pace here, because I do not think Gorbachev wants to slow down an agreement on conventional arms. If he does, he is wrong on that. But I do not believe he does. I think he wants to move forward there and on the strategic arms talks, and so do we. From your conversation, did you get any sense of what the bottom line is in Eastern Europe as far as political change? I mean, what are the two or three points that you cannot cross? No, there does not seem to be a bottom line, because when you go to open, free, fair elections, who knows what is going to happen? Take a look at Hungary I mean at Poland. Take a look at those Polish elections. So, the change is so rapid and so devastating to old ways that I do not think you can put a bottom line on the thing. Perhaps Gorbachev is also looking at the elections? Probably looking at the elections at home, and that is a good thing. I tell you, the excitement of all this, you just feel it in talking to the leaders and feel it from the people. specific with both leaders that further economic reform for example, did you discuss with them the sale of state-owned business or getting private enterprise to the people in both Poland and Hungary? Yes, both, but in varying degrees of detail. Of course, Lech Walesa that was his whole thrust: privatization. And the talks with Mr. Jaruzelski we got into that. Mainly we were talking about joint ventures and partnerships, but also I had the opportunity to emphasize our conviction that state ownership is less productive than private ownership. And similarly, in a couple of the meetings maybe we did in all but in a couple of the meetings yesterday there was discussion of privatization. No resistance, incidentally, it seemed like, in Hungary. But we had a very frank discussion about what percentage of their gross national product was in government and what in private sector, and Hungary still has a long way to go until it achieves privatization. any Communists or are they all, essentially they are all democratic, pluralistic I met people that are caught up in this wave of historic change. What about Are they changing their whole philosophy? They are Communists, are not they? You asked whether one of the leaders made a big distinction between a Communist and a Socialist. And one of them pointed out that European socialism could well be the model of the future as opposed to the socialism that we equate with communism. What about the austerity side of this? Did you get into 2 years ago, the Poles would not get the votes they needed, and then you talk about belt-tightening. But did they talk to you about what they would do? And do you have any qualms that this might backfire that if these supports are removed, the Poles may not get the candy they need to keep supporting the system? I had some feeling after some of the talks that the reforms that would be required would be very difficult for them. That is not universal, but it did come up. in any way communicate that to Gorbachev? No, except indirectly saying please tell Mr. Gorbachev this, that, or the other. Would you have any plans to contact him Well, we have regularized contacts with the Soviet Union now, and we will continue on those. But there could be occasion to do that. Did Lech Walesa tell you about the powder-keg situation in Poland, as he told TV interviewers? Well, as I said, some of the interlocutors made clear that the kinds of reforms that are going to have to be taken will not be easy. It was not put in the context of powder keg. Well, I think we spelled out some broad parameters: privatization, openness, free elections. And that is just the American way, that is just our belief as to what works. And to the degree those things take place, why, we will be able to do more. Walesa? Yes. I'd met him before, and it is funny how you just meet one time and it establishes a certain personal warmth there. ENTITY, you talked about the changes, and you used the word amazing. Were you surprised by the things you saw? Not textbook surprised, but surprised at the feeling: the feeling and the emotion of it all and the frankness with which the leaders -- in Hungary particularly; well, and also Jaruzelski and Walesa -- talked about the change. I mean it was with emotion, and it was not your traditional I will read my cards, and you read your cards kind of diplomacy. It was very special in that regard. There is an intensity to it, a fervor to it that moved me very much. You mean like in Eastern Europe? Well, I think without the change in the Soviet Union it would have been highly unlikely that Eastern Europe would be achieving the kinds of changes or aspiring to the kinds of changes that it is aspiring to. Oh, I do not know. I do not ever look for disputes, I look for calming the troubled waters. You know that. I do not know that either. Well, I want to go to Africa, but there is no doubt -- I would not say that would be the next, would you? keep this policy alive? I do not think it is the U.S. role to keep the change alive. I mean, I think this is something that is the business of the Poles and of the Hungarians. This is their business; this is their life, their country. I think it would be rather arrogant to suggest that it is the United States that has the sole responsibility. That is not your question. But it, to the degree we can encourage change without intervention in the internal affairs -- why, I am all for that. But that is not our role. This is too fundamental: The people's aspiration for liberty and for free choice is too fundamental. And they can look to our system, look to our country, as a beacon for all these good values. But it is not our role to go in and dictate to any of these countries how they are going to run their business. tore up that I know that struck you the most about it, because you did not have to stand out in the rain. He said they liked that. Did they really? Well, I mean, I had plenty of opportunity to pay my formal respects, which, in essence, was what that was about. And those people had been standing there a long time. I told them the next day one of the leaders was very complimentary of that. And I said it reminds me of an old adage that the United States the speech that you do not that was the one in the rain. Who are you going to send to Israel as an emissary? Well, there is not any emissary going from ENTITY of the United States. There is no determination of that at this point. a chance to talk at the Wallenberg Memorial. Have you had any contact at all with the Soviets on that question? Well, we chose to stop there because Wallenberg is a great international symbol of human rights. And I do not know -- what do you mean about contact about -- -- I mean, it is a constant issue that U.S. officials are regularly asking of the Soviets I have not personally asked of the Soviets that. Are you saying that the Secretary of State might send an emissary? Well, I am saying that we have people go to Israel all the time and to other countries in the area. But when you say, Who am I sending as an emissary? -- I was putting that in the context of past high-level shuttle diplomats or something of that nature, and there are no plans for that. I reserve the right to send people anytime I think it is in the interest of the United States, but there are no plans for that kind of level -- diplomacy. Why is the U.S. making But if somebody felt it was worthwhile, somebody over there would welcome a special emissary from ENTITY, I'd be very openminded about that. But there are no plans. You asked me whether there are plans. find out what is going in terms of We have got a very able Ambassador over there who knows a great deal about what is going on and has excellent contacts with the Government. What do you think is going on over there? Shamir has simply restated what his position has been all along. Why is the U.S. so shook up over this? The President. I do not know that the U.S. is so shook up, but they know the United States policy. And the United States policy on settlements, for example, has not changed, and it is not going to change. And so, we might as well be frank with our friends, because that is what friendship is about. And so, I want to see things go forward in terms of the peace process over there, and we want to see the election process go forward. And if anybody can make a case for me that the recent deliberations in that party will enhance the election process, then I'd say, Great! But I am afraid other people are looking at it, saying, What is happened does not enhance the possibilities of election. So, the U.S. policy is set. And I am President of the United States, and Israel is a friend and will remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is -- and so, I do not think there is great heartburn here, but I want to just continue to articulate what we believe. -- -- Shamir said -- what should be important from the very start -- so I am trying to figure out why the United States is so distressed. I am not so distressed. I am I mean State Department. Well, you go ahead and talk to the State Department about that. You are talking to the President. I set the policy, after a lot of input from the State Department, and I want the U.S. policy to succeed. We have thought out very carefully what we think is best, and our support is for our principles. And they have got great difficulties inside of Israel. I understand that. I understand the political pressures. But I cannot be varying U.S. policy every day to accommodate political change. I am not going to do that. How about the Palestinian Keep encouraging them to do what they ought to do: to participate in this election process -- absolutely -- and deplore the kind of violence that we see when a bus is carried over a cliff and carrying a lot of innocent people to their death, or innocent people getting killed in other ways -- on both sides. I mean we have to stand for something. And I am going to continue to try to do that. When did you first decide you were President? When did it hit you? I do not know. But I am deciding more and more that I am. Experience never hurt anybody, did it? Experience does not hurt.

{"id": 180, "text": "I only have 20 minutes or thereabouts, so I have tried to write some concise questions. So, let me put it to you this way. The conservative revolt that Jack Kemp is leading appears to be a challenge to your leadership of the party. And I wonder if you think this is a decisive battle with the far right between the main body of the party? I do not know whether it is a decisive battle. But, very frankly, I am surprised, because I think the issue is so clear cut that when the facts are explained, how they can continue resistance to this when we have protected entirely the tax cuts passed last year and when, in fact, this is less a tax increase than it is a tax reform. Only about 17 percent of this represents new taxes on the people, and 31 percent represents collecting money that we are duty bound to collect, because it is owed and presently not being paid. Nevertheless, there is a distinct rift in the party Yes. together, and I am wondering how you plan to restore this GOP unity and your own leadership amongst the so-called dissidents. They are so far on the wrong side right now that I think maybe it is up to them to restore it with me Is Jack Kemp now out of your coalition. Oh, no. Your backers? I do not bear grudges or anything, no. He is been here to the leadership meetings, and he is heard my side. I realize how strongly he well, is almost, you might say, a purist to the extent that he just cannot see the difference between reform and increase. And if it were a case of this present tax reform which, incidentally, was not of our choosing. This was made necessary in order to get the spending cuts we are still trying to get. If it had resulted in altering the incentive tax cuts that we put in place, I could understand. I am just hard put to understand how he can continue to believe that this in some way represents a turn in my direction or philosophy, because it does not . Does what he is doing do you hold the theory of the allegation of what he is doing is his effort to buttress his own ambitions for the Presidency in 1984? No, I am not going to make any suppositions of that at all. You do not believe that? I will just accept it as a legitimate disagreement. Where are the Boll Weevils on this particular issue? They helped you very much last year. Now, this is awfully I have been meeting with individuals and with groups from the Congress steadily for the last several days, and I have to tell you that this seems to me a more mixed situation, that there is division within these various groups, and I could not pin down exactly, rather than that one group that you just mentioned, Jack and that coterie that is a united group. I think there is a division in all the ranks Gypsy Moths, Boll Weevils, Republicans, Democrats on support of this. And what I have been doing in the meetings is simply trying to correct the misperception they have of it, and, in many cases, that is been successful, that they have come in with a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do. Well, I have never seen you work so hard as you have in the past 2 weeks. Do you think you have attained the 100 votes or near it that the Democrats say have to get before they will support it? I do not know. All I can say is that everything indicates we are making progress. You do not want to predict victory yet? No. Down to the wire? Yes, you know, I am cautiously optimistic all the time. Are you going to keep this pace up all the way through Tuesday? It is going to depend on whether it is necessary or not. You have not decided whether to go to the Nation on television yet? Well, we were talking about this early in the week, because, again, much of the press coverage, I think, has contributed to a misconception about this. And I, in these couple of trips that I have made out in the last few weeks into the country, I discovered that this constant drumbeat of biggest tax increase in history when it is nothing of the kind has well, the people are uninformed. And when I have had an opportunity, as I did in Billings, Montana, the other day, to explain what it is we are doing, I found then the people were in support. Well, why do you think the Conservative Republicans are resisting this bill so much? Is it because it taxes people who have not been paying and should have been, or because it reduces tax benefits on things like construction or things like cigarettes, dividend interest, or is this just an election-year reaction? I think it is, pretty much, an election-year reaction, and the idea that they may be portrayed as, now, supporting tax increases when we have been the party going the other way. Of course, I must say that some of those conservative voices I have to be frank and say they cannot be described as people who were followers and have abandoned me. Some of them never were for me. Like the Conservative Digest? Yes. I have read your letter, the last part of the letter. Do you feel that you have met your mandate to reduce spending and taxes, in view of the figures that the Wall Street Journal had? I do not want to get this too complicated. They said spending this year is 24.1 percent of the GNP, compared to 21.9 in the '75 recession, and 22.5 in the last Carter year, the GNP, now, being 24.1 higher than either of the previous recessions. Well, of course, you have got to recognize that in the depth of this recession, there had been a bigger dip in the percentagewise, also in the gross national product. What I am counting on we are going to get that percentage down. We think that the percentage has been too high for a number of years of gross national product. But we are talking about a normal gross national product also. We have had a long period in which the GNP has been going down, and only just recently, in this last quarter, did it show any increase at all. The percentage that we are aiming at is to reduce the percentage of increase in government spending each year. And, when we took office, it was running at 17 percent a year, increasing. Now, remember, on the other hand, we have an obligation that I accepted during the campaign of one area where there would be increased spending. And that was to rectify the damage that has been done to our national security and national defense. And, many times in the campaign, I was asked by people in question-and-answer sessions, and sometimes by the press, if I found that I came down to choice of balancing the budget or doing what needed to be done for national defense, which side would I come down on? And I said every time, On the side of national defense. And, incidentally, to audiences, when that was asked, that answer always received applause, which indicated to me that the American people have been well aware that our defenses had been allowed to deteriorate. Were you aware that Ed Meese 2 said yesterday in a speech here that the conservatives' way has not worked, and that now, quote, We have to try something else. Does that mean that the administration or yourself was reconsidering supply-side economics? No. And I think maybe he was talking about those same dissidents that you have been talking about there, and I'd like to see the whole framework or the manner in which it was asked or something. The no, I still believe in the combination: first of all, continued reduction in spending; at the same time, that for the economy's sake and to get it rolling again that we must also, as we can, reduce the percentage that government is taking in taxes from the people. Now, to that extent this is probably what Jack Kemp is relying on, that wherever it may come from, that this $99 billion now is coming from the private sector and going to government. You are certainly perceived as further to the center than Kemp is right now, or he is further to the right than you are, but But, again, as I say, the answer to that I can give him is: You could not add the other, which is all important. It was made plain to us this year. We did not come in with the proposal to raise revenues. We came in with the proposal for more cutting of spending. And found out this time and crossing the aisle, Democrat and Republican we could not put together a coalition for the continued spending cuts unless we would agree to some added revenues. Now, when, over a 3 year period, those revenues turned out to be revenue increases $99 billion, $31 billion of which is money owed the Government not being collected and in that same 3 year period our tax cuts are going to bring in $406 3 billion to the people then I figured that the price was not too high in return for getting $280 billion in reduced outlays, $3 for every $1 of revenue. What is your opinion of the reported threat I do not know if it is a real threat or a reported threat that Republican National Committee campaign funds might be withheld from House candidates in November if they do not vote for this bill? Weft, I do not see that. I do not know that that is anything more than rumor. My own feeling is we I am going to do my best to campaign for Republicans and get Republicans in office here No matter how they vote on the tax bill? That is right. You and you go for the entire record. But there are large tax increases in the bill, although it is not entirely a tax bill although not on personal income. And I know you'd rather have what this cut pass. What was Larry's 4 word was we choked on it, I think. That was his word. I swallowed Swallow hard. That is Yes. But what is the rationale for cutting $17.5 billion from the Federal health and welfare programs? Because, here again, people automatically transfer that into a reduction of care for those who really need it. What we see these as, these cuts, are based on our estimates of how we can continue to give the necessary care but eliminate the fat that has grown in the program. When we reformed welfare in California, we found out that in the Medicaid program, for example, the Medicaid patients were averaging several times as long in a hospital for an operation as private patients were for the same operation. Now, we do not think that means that they were that much worse off. I think some of it was that it was easier for a doctor to just leave them there and see them on his morning rounds than to have an office call or a house call or something. It was not they had no reason to get out. The average patient, you or I in a hospital, we know the price of the room, and the first thing we start asking is, How soon can I go home? Well, where they have no concern, they were willing to convalesce. It is that type of thing that we think will result from the tightening in the amount of money. Are you convinced that this reduction of 17.5 will not do harm or damage to any of the people who have need of these services? No, I do not think it will. Will you veto I know you do not like to forecast vetoes, but strong signals, let us say the urgent supplemental bill that is coming down, even though it contains the CBI as sort of a hostage? Let me say, you. This does not come out until Monday. you almost answered the question yourself. In principle, I have told the Congress I am going to veto budget busting bills, if I have to do that in order to make them match this tax increase with the cuts in spending that are supposed to be attached to it. But I do refrain from announcing a veto of any specific bill until it arrives on my desk and I see it. We all know what it is like now. Do you think you can get the CBI out of another CBI separate bill out of the Senate later? I do not know. I will tell you this: I wish that the President of the United States had the power that most Governors have in their own States, which is the right of line item veto. It would sure make the job simpler. I will see if I cannot arrange that. I was going to talk only about taxes, but I hope you let me allow me as I terminate here one question about the Middle East. Sometime ago you said out on the lawn that you were out of patience a long time ago, presumably with Israel's constant assaults on Beirut. And yesterday you spoke in terms that can only be called stern or harsh to Mr. Begin. But what can you do to curb Israeli military action if the current effort by Habib 5 fails that is a hypothetical question but if they begin bombarding again today: recall Habib, cut off military assistance? Well, there are there are any number of options. I have not set any down as priorities as to which way we'd go, but I am hopeful that I do not have to because my conversation was very satisfactory. And the cease fire is in effect, yesterday, one of the reasons why I felt this was time to really we have been in communication, and the only reason why they have not seen any action about it before is because the negotiations have been so sensitive, that any public statement might do something harmful to them. But now the negotiations had reached the point of the actual logistics; all parties were agreed, in principle, logistics of the move out. And suddenly that bombardment made it impossible for them to continue those negotiations. So, I must say in my first call to Begin, he told me that he had already ordered a cessation of aerial bombing and Did he tell you he was going to curb Sharon's powers, too? No, that never came up. That might help. Who will be the first troops to show up the Americans, the French, or the Italians? The what? The Americans, the French, or the Italians? It was my understanding that the there were some liaison officers that both French and America went in. And there is been no final decision yet, because there is been no formal invitation. The Israelis oppose that, do not they? Well, then that is still part of what Habib's talking about. Because it does not matter to you whether the Americans are first, second, or third? No. I hope I have not overstayed my time. Thank you, ENTITY. All right.

{"id": 509, "text": "ENTITY, thank you for doing this. Canadians are very excited about your trip. Thank you. When they watch you today sign your recovery bill into law, how concerned should they be that the Buy America clause is still there, even though you have given assurances international trade agreements will be respected. How concerned should they be? I do not think they should be too concerned. You know, I think that if you look at history, one of the most important things during a worldwide recession of the sort that we are seeing now is that each country does not resort to beggar thy neighbor policies, protectionist policies. They can end up further contracting world trade. And my administration is committed to making sure that even as we take steps to strengthen the U.S. economy that we are doing so in a way that actually over time will enhance the ability of trading partners, like Canada, to work within our boundaries. And my expectation is, is that where you have strong U.S. competitors who can sell products and services, that a lot of Governors and mayors are going to want to try to find U.S. equipment or services, but that we are going to abide by our World Trade Organization and NAFTA obligations just as we always have. You mentioned NAFTA. A year ago you were pretty critical of NAFTA. In fact, you even suggested at one point that the U.S. opt out if it could not renegotiate. Do you think that is the time now to be making that case, or is it something that is set aside now? As I said, I think there are a lot of sensitivities right now because of the huge decline in world trade. As I have said before, NAFTA, the basic framework of the agreement has environmental and labor protections as side agreements. My argument has always been that we might as well incorporate them into the full agreement so that they are fully enforceable. But what I have also said is that Canada is one of our most important trading partners. We rely on them heavily. There is $1.5 billion worth of trade going back and forth every day between the two countries, and that it is not in anybody's interests to see that trade diminish. Especially now. Absolutely. Part of that trade involves the energy sector; a lot of oil and gas comes to the United States from Canada and even more in the future with oil sands development. Now, there are some in your country and Canada as well who feel the oil sands is dirty oil because of the extraction process. What do you think? Is it dirty oil? Well, it what we know is that oil sands create a big creates a big carbon footprint. And so the dilemma that Canada faces, the United States faces, and China and the entire world faces is how do we obtain the energy that we need to grow our economies in a way that is not rapidly accelerating climate change. And that is one of the reasons why the stimulus bill that I will be signing today contains billions of dollars towards clean energy development. I think to the extent that Canada and the United States can collaborate on ways that we can sequester carbon, capture greenhouse gases before they are emitted into the atmosphere, that is going to be good for everybody. Because if we do not , then we are going to have a ceiling at some point in terms of our ability to expand our economies and maintain the standard of living that is so important, particularly when you have got countries like China and India that are obviously interested in catching up. So are you drawing a link, then, in terms of the future of tar sands oil coming into the U.S. contingent on a sense of a continental environment policy on cap and trade? Well, I think what I am suggesting is, is that no country in isolation is going to be able to solve this problem. So Canada, the United States, China, India, the European Union, all of us are going to have to work together in an effective way to figure out how do we balance the imperatives of economic growth with very real concerns about the effect we are having on our planet. And ultimately, I think this can be solved by technology. I think that it is possible for us to create a set of clean energy mechanisms that allow us to use things not just like oil sands, but also coal. The United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal, but we have our own homegrown problems in terms of dealing with a cheap energy source that creates a big carbon footprint. And so we are not going to be able to deal with any of these issues in isolation. The more that we can develop technologies that tap alternative sources of energy but also contain the environmental damage of fossil fuels, the better off we are going to be. I know you are looking at it as a global situation, in terms of global partners, but there are some who do argue that this is the time; if there was ever going to be a continental energy policy and a continental environmental policy, this would be it. Would you agree with that thinking? Well, you know, I think one of the promising areas for not just for bilateral but also trilateral cooperation is around this issue. I met with President Calderon here in the United States, and Mexico actually has taken some of the boldest steps around the issues of alternative energy and carbon reductions of any country out there. And it is very rare for a country that is still involved in developing and trying to raise its standard of living to stay as focused on this issue as President Calderon's administration has. What I think that offers is the possibility of a template that we can create between Canada, the United States, and Mexico that is moving forcefully around these issues. But as I said, it is going to be important for us to make sure that countries like China and India, with enormous populations and huge energy needs, that they are brought into this process as well. Afghanistan. As you know, Canada has been there from the beginning, since the fall of 2001 and has suffered extreme casualties in its combat missions there. And the Canadian Parliament has decided, out of combat by the year 2011. When you go to Ottawa, will you have any suggestions to Canada that it should reconsider what its role in Afghanistan is? Well, first of all, I think the Canadian contribution has been extraordinary, and for all the families who have borne the burden in Canada, I think we all have a heartfelt thanks. I am in the process of a strategic review of our approach in Afghanistan. Very soon we will be releasing some initial plans in terms of how we are going to approach the military side of the equation in Afghanistan. But I am absolutely convinced that you cannot solve the problem of Afghanistan, the Taliban, the spread of extremism in that region solely through military means. We are going to have to use diplomacy; we are going to have to use development. And my hope is that in conversations that I have with Prime Minister Harper, that he and I end up seeing the importance of a comprehensive strategy and one that ultimately the people of Canada can support, as well as the people of the United States can support, because obviously, here as well, there are a lot of concerns about a conflict that has lasted quite a long time now and actually appears to be deteriorating at this point. But are you saying that you will or you will not ask Canada to remain in a combat role? Well, I think, you know, we have got until 2011, according to the Canadian Legislature, and I think it is important for the Canadian Legislature and the people of Canada to get a sense that what they are doing is productive. So what I will be communicating is the approach that we intend to take. Obviously, I am going to be continuing to ask other countries to help think through how do we approach this very difficult problem. But I do not have a specific ask in my pocket that I intend to bring out in our meetings. Is Afghanistan still winnable? Well, I think Afghanistan is still winnable in the sense of our ability to ensure that it is not a launching pad for attacks against North America. I think it is still possible for us to stamp out Al Qaida to make sure that extremism is not expanding but rather is contracting. I think all those goals are still possible, but I think that as a consequence of the war on Iraq, we took our eye off the ball. We have not been as focused as we need to be on all the various steps that are needed in order to deal with Afghanistan. If you have got narcotrafficking that is funding the Taliban, if there is a perception that there is no rule of law in Afghanistan, if we do not solve the issue of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, then we are probably not going to solve the problem. I am down to my last minute, a couple of quickies on Canada, your sense of the country. I mean, I think, as you may know, you carry Canada on your belt. That BlackBerry is a Canadian invention. Absolutely. You have been to Canada once. What is your sense of the country? Well, yes, I have been to Canada a couple of times. Most recently, it was to visit my brother-in-law's family who was from Burlington right outside of Toronto. Look, I think that Canada is one of the most impressive countries in the world, the way it has managed a diverse population, a vibrant economy. You know, the natural beauty of Canada is extraordinary. Obviously, there is enormous kinship between the United States and Canada, and the ties that bind our two countries together are things that are very important to us. And, you know, one of the things that I think has been striking about Canada is that in the midst of this enormous economic crisis, I think Canada has shown itself to be a pretty good manager of the financial system in the economy in ways that we have not always been here in the United States. And I think that is important for us to take note of, that it is possible for us to have a vibrant banking sector, for example, without taking some of the wild risks that have resulted in so much trouble on Wall Street. Appreciate this very much. You still have not seen your first hockey game. I am looking forward to making it happen at some point. ENTITY, thank you very much. Thank you so much.

There is no obstruction whatsoever. And I am looking forward to it. I do worry when I look at all of the things that you people do not report about, with what is happening. If you take a look at, you know, the five months' worth of missing texts that is a lot of missing texts. And as I said yesterday, that is prime time. So you do sort of look at that and say, What is going on? You do look at certain texts where they talk about insurance policies or insurance where they say the kinds of things they are saying, you gotta be concerned. But I would love to do that, and I'd like to do it as soon as possible. When will you do it, Mr. ENTITY? Do you have a date set? So here is the story Do you have a date set, Mr. ENTITY? I do not know, no. I guess you are talking about two or three weeks, but I would love to do it. In person? You know, again, it is I have to say subject to my lawyers and all of that but I would love to do it. Would you do it under oath, Mr. ENTITY? You mean like Hillary did it under who said that? I said that. Oh. Would you do it under oath? Oh you said it. You did say it. You say a lot. Did Hillary do it under oath? I have no idea, but I am not asking about I think you have an idea. Do not you have an idea? Wait, wait, wait. Do you not have an idea? Do you really not have an idea? I will give you an idea. She did not do it under oath. But I would do it under oath. Listen, but I would do it. And you know she did not do it under oath, right? She would do it under oath. If you did not know about Hillary, then you are not much of a ENTITY. Mr. ENTITY, you are going to do it under oath? To reach a higher standard, you would do it under oath? Oh, I would do it under oath. You would? Absolutely. Do you trust the FBI? Well, what am I going to say? I am very disturbed, as is the general, as is everybody else that is intelligent. When you look at five months? This is the late great Rose Mary Woods, right? This is a large-scale version of this. That was 18 minutes, this is five months. They say it is 50,000 texts and it is prime time. That is disturbing. Should McCabe go? Should McCabe go, Mr. ENTITY? Well, McCabe got more than $500,000 from essentially Hillary Clinton. And is he investigating Hillary Clinton? So should he go? Do you remember, did anybody hear many of my speeches when I talked about McCabe? He was the star of my speech. This is not now. And I said a man who was more or less in charge of her the wife got $500,000 from Terry. Now Terry is Hillary. And, yeah, I mean Do you regret having him as your acting FBI director, then? You know what, I keep out of it. You'd find that hard to believe. I keep out of it. That is the way it fell. He is been there. It is one of those things. But he was the star of many of my speeches. Because he got from $500,000 to $700,000, whatever the number was. Got that money for the wife. And, you know, in Virginia Did you ask him who he voted for? It is very interesting. Wait. In Virginia, you do not have to spend the money. So I never checked as to whether or not they spent the money on the campaign. How much of the money did he spend on the campaign, do you know she how much was it? Wait, how much of the money was spent? Did you ask who he voted for? You know. Did you ask McCabe who he voted for? Did you ask him that? I do not think so. You do not think you did? No, I do not think I did. You did not? Is it possible you did? I do not know what is the big deal with that. Because I would ask you, Who did you vote for? I do not think that is a big deal. But I do not remember that. I saw that this morning. I do not remember asking him that question. Is it possible you did? Is it a possibility? I do not remember asking him the question. I think it is also a very unimportant question, but I do not remember asking him that. Hey, chief, would you do me a favor? When we come back, when we come back, I want you to have a deal, OK? See if you could have a deal. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY. We can use all the audio? Nice and, not you do not repeat, and this and that, just one nice piece. OK? One more quick one. Do you believe Robert Mueller will be fair to you? I only repeat for the purposes of making sure you understand. One more quick one do you think Robert Mueller will be fair to you in this larger investigation? We are going to find out. Are you concerned about it? Because here is what we will say, and everybody says: No collusion. There is no collusion. Now they are saying, Oh, well, 'Did he fight back? Did he fight back?' You fight back, 'Oh, it is obstruction.' So, here is the thing: I hope so. How do you define collusion? Maggie asked this earlier during the briefing to Sarah You are going to define it for me, OK? But I can tell you, there is no collusion. I could not have cared less about Russians having to do with my campaign. The fact is you people will not say this, but I will say it: I was a much better candidate than her. You always say she was a bad candidate. You never say I was a good candidate. I was one of the greatest candidates. Nobody else would have beaten the Clinton machine, as crooked as it was. But I was a great candidate. Someday you are going to say that.

{"id": 360, "text": "Welcome, ENTITY, to our Choose or Lose bus. Thank you. Thank you very much for taking the time to do this on your bus tour. In your speech last night you said that drugs were wrong and deadly. But on MTV a couple of years ago, someone asked you if you could inhale-if you could do it over again, would you inhale, and you said, Yeah, I tried the first time. That was true. Do you wish that you had answered differently? Because Republicans are planning on using this to attack you. Oh, they are using it, but all I said was-I was just trying to make the point that I had never-when I answered the question I told the truth. I just told the truth about the question. It was a joke? Yes. The question was, in context, it was a light-hearted-- It was a light-hearted question, and it was not in the context of some sort of endorsement of drug use, and they know that. If you look at the record I established as Governor, the record I have established as ENTITY, the things I have worked on, and if you look at the terrible price my own family has paid and my brother's problem which literally nearly killed him, I think that my position on this is clear. I am very concerned about it really because every so often, you know, years go by and we see drug use going down. We still see drug use going down among adults; that is the interesting thing. In the last 4 years, drug use among people 18 to 34 has gone down because people have begun to think more about their own lives, their responsibilities then when they have children, and they began to be concerned about the risks. But every few years, apparently, younger people believe it is not dangerous anymore and believe that the risks, if there are any, can be borne. The risks of, let us say, cocaine, heroin, and hallucinogens and marijuana are different kinds of risks, but there are real risks associated with all of them. And I am very hopeful, now that General McCaffrey has come on and agreed to be our drug czar and we are focusing now- I would not say exclusively but clearly primarily on people under 18, that we and people around the country will be able to do something about this. I wanted to ask you another question about the convention. I think a lot of people were confused by what they saw at both conventions; they saw singing Senators and delegates macarena-ing. Obviously it is a party, you know, but many people did not hear the message coming from the conventions. For instance, obviously Christopher Reeve has done a lot of good for people who suffer from his disability, but why is his disability an argument to vote for you? For two reasons. One is, Christopher Reeve made an impassioned plea for research. In my budget we have consistently invested more in research, both in health care areas like spinal cord disease, breast cancer, HIV, and AIDS, and also in science and technology. We are now building with IBM a computer, a supercomputer that will do more calculations in a second than a person with a handheld calculator could do in 30,000 years-30,000 years. It is unbelievable. And I believe that it is very important to vote for ENTITY who believes in the future and who is really committed to science and technology and research. The second reason is, as Christopher Reeve so eloquently told me when we were visiting in the Oval Office, not everyone who gets a serious injury and becomes disabled is wealthy; most people are not , and even wealthy people can quickly be bankrupted by the cost of care. The Medicaid program which the Federal Government has maintained for 30 years contains a guarantee of aid to families with disabilities who are middle class or below, to enable them to maintain a middle class life, to keep their jobs, and still give their disabled family member some help. In the budget-which I vetoed-of the Republican Congress, which Senator Dole and Mr. Gingrich led through Congress, they would have removed that guarantee, just sent some money to the States, put a lid on it, and then let the States decide what to do. And I think it is highly likely that the first people to be sacrificed would have been people with disabilities. So those are the two reasons that his being there embodied the human connection to ENTITY and his actions, the Congress, and what happens to people's lives. And every other person that was there on Monday night, the same thing. The Brady bill, it was obvious because they talked about it. Mike Robbins, the Chicago police officer, was riddled with bullets by an assault weapon. The young AmeriCorps girl was important because the Republicans have tried to abolish AmeriCorps twice. The educator is important because they wanted to cut back on educational aid; I wanted to invest more money in education. So everybody there-the Toledo autoworker was important because we have opened new markets to Japan and other parts in the world and America is number one in auto production again. So we started our convention in a very different way. We had a whole series of citizens speaking to establish the connection between their vote and their lives. Speaking of Senator Dole and the Republicans, the Republicans are accusing you of theft of their values agenda, stealing their ideas and making them your own. How do you plead? Well, the Republicans tried for years to convince the American people that only one party had values. And unfortunately-I believe it was unfortunate-they were too often rewarded for that. But I never believed that only Republicans could stand up for the American family. I never believed that only Republicans could be tough on crime. I thought those were American issues. But if we were going to argue that they belonged to one party or another-I mean, here is a fact: The first bill I signed was the Family and Medical Leave Act. My predecessor, my Republican predecessor, vetoed it twice, and Senator Dole led the fight against it. Now, who is the more pro-family? I fought the crime bill through, which put 100,000 police on the street, banned assault weapons, and had tougher punishment programs and prevention programs for young people. The bitterest, I mean really, literally, bitterest opponent of the crime bill in the entire Congress was Senator Dole. Now, who is strong against crime? We have got 4 years of declining crime. So I did not steal their values. On welfare reform, long before they ever passed a bill, 3 months into my Presidency I granted the first waiver to a State to try a welfare-to-work experiment. We now have 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than we did the day I took office- before this welfare bill takes effect. So I did not steal their values agenda. I believe they are American values, and I did something about it. And I think they are angry because they made so many votes for years just by talking about it and not doing anything about it. So we did something about it, and they are complaining about it. Are you afraid of being seen as sort of-are you afraid of your politics being perceived as sort of Republican-like, a less radical approach to their ideas? No. Let me just take one other example. The only reason I ask is because people are wondering if you are the same person they elected in '92. If you look at what we talked about at the convention, if you look at what we have done over the last 4 years-including in the last 2 years-the budget that I passed, I put the Democrats on the side of deficit reduction and balancing the budget, because I believe that. That is what I ran on. But all the Republicans voted against our budget because it also made the Tax Code fairer. It lowered taxes on 15 million working people, asked those of us in the highest income groups, the top one percent of us, to pay a little more. They opposed me on family and medical leave, most of them did. They opposed my education reforms, all progressive things. They opposed the crime bill. Then when we finally got some action out of this last Congress, there was-the health care reform proposal was a big part of my health care reform bill that I signed. The minimum wage bill, the pension relief for small businesses, was legislation that I always advocated. So I think it sounds good. But what was the biggest thing I did in the last 2 years? I vetoed their budget. So I do not see how they can say I am Republican-like. I just think that they like saying, We are for a balanced budget; the Democrats are big spenders. We are tough on crime; the Democrats are weak on crime. We are for work instead of welfare; the Democrats are for welfare instead of work. And even some of our own commentators kind of got hung up in that. If we protect children and we give families the right to and the tools they need to make the most of their own lives, we should be for a balanced budget, a growing economy, work instead of welfare, and tough on crime. So I feel very good about it, and I do not think it is inconsistent. Dick Morris helped you make a political comeback over the last 2 years, and he is been running, according to just about everyone, a phenomenal campaign. Now he is resigned. Will you still be talking to him on the phone about politics? I do not plan to do that, no. But we do have a good team, and we all work together. You are not worried at all with him not being there? No, because we have a good team. And everybody had a role to play, and we all agreed early on on a strategy. And then when we-we had a decisionmaking process which I think is very good, which I am just going to keep in place. I am going to keep the team I have got. I am going to keep the decisionmaking process in place. And I think we will do very well. So you will not be communicating with him anymore? I do not have any plans to do that. I do not say I will not communicate with him. My wife and I and the Vice President all called him and just had a purely personal conversation. But this campaign is now the product of a record we have made and the proposals we have out there and the fact that we-our administration stood against what Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole tried to do in '95 and early '96. And those will be the salient elements that the American people will have to decide on, and we will do the best we can. But I feel good about it. There is talk in Republican circles of renewing character attacks on you because of their opinion that you surround yourself with questionable people. How are you going to respond? I am not. I am going to keep doing my job. I think the reason that talk is there, though, is that way they do not have to talk about over 10 million new jobs; they do not have to talk about the fact that my Democratic administration is the first one to reduce the deficit in all 4 of its years, since before the Civil War; that our budget would be in surplus today if it were not for the interest we pay on the debt run up in the 12 years of the Republican Presidencies before me; that we have made college loans more available and more affordable, and they tried to cut back on it; that the crime rate has come down under our strategy, and they opposed it. They do not have to talk about those things, but I am going to talk about what is right for the American people. The American people will make their judgments about-and probably already have made their judgments about that. And I do not intend to respond in kind. I am going to keep saying what I said before: I like Senator Dole. I have had a good relationship with him. I honor the 35 years he gave this country in Congress, and I respect him for the way he fought back from his injury in the war. And I just do not think that it is good for America, and I am going to try to make this election about big things that touch the people we just saw on the side of the road there. Or little things that touch them, too. And the little things that touch them. You captured the imagination of young people in 1992, along with their votes. I saw young people at the MTV Inaugural Ball weeping when you arrived. Maybe their expectations were too high, but even with national service and all your educational programs, a lot of them feel just as disconnected today as they did 4 years ago. Do you feel like you have let people down? Have you not gotten your message out as clearly as you could have? Well, I think the campaign will help. But all I can say is-- Were their expectations too high? I do not know, because I do not know what their expectations were. I want them to be high. But if you look at what happened on this train trip, that was my first real-I do not think polls can tell you these things. I do not think you can poll this. But when we were out there, and on this train trip we stopped-most of our rallies were in very small towns. We only had 2 stops where there were fewer than 10,000 people there. There were more than 150,000 total people who came to our rallies in those 3 days on the train. And then there were hundreds and hundreds of people, place after place after place, just on the side of the road as we were going. We had 30,000 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, today, our first bus stop. I think people do feel connected. Look, I think they feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves. I think they think the country is moving again. I do believe in the first 2 years that-one of the things that I have learned over many years is that there is a time lag between when ENTITY or a Governor or a Congress takes an action and when it can be felt in the lives of the American people. So that we saw real economic growth coming from 1993 on, but there was no evidence until really about 8 months ago that the American people were beginning to feel it in their own lives, when paychecks finally started to go up again, when people saw that there were enough new jobs to make a difference in the local economy. It is the same thing with education. Now we are beginning-we have got a critical mass of young people who have been either in national service or even many, many more are getting the new college loans, the direct loans that they can pay back as a percentage of their income. We have reduced the welfare rolls by enough now that people are beginning to perceive it. The crime rate has come down now 4 years in a row so that people are finally beginning to perceive it. Their streets are safer, even though the crime rate in America is far too high still. I think that is a part of it. And so I think that my obligation is to go back to the young people of America and say, here is what I said I'd do 4 years ago; here is what we have done; here is what we are going to do in the next 4 years. And that is a lot of what we tried to do at our convention. Young people are alienated from politics. Young people think politics is rigged by money, and they are right. Democrats received tens of millions of dollars in corporate contributions. What are those corporations getting for their money? Well, I think it is fair to say that most of the corporations that contribute to either party agree with their policies. But keep in mind, almost all the wealthy individuals and some of the corporations that contributed to the Democratic Party are doing so even though their tax bills went up, because only the top 1.2 percent of individuals and corporations with incomes over $10 million a year had an income tax increase under our tax bill. And a lot of them supported us anyway, first of all because they knew I was right, that to get the deficit down, get interest rates down-they'd all do better with a healthier economy. I do not believe that any of them have supported me for some sort of bad or unseemly reason. On the other hand, I think it would be better if we had a campaign finance reform system that would enable people in public life to spend less time raising money and to be less dependent on it. But the only way you can do it is to give greater access to the airwaves, to candidates or parties, because it just costs so much to communicate. So it is our fault. No, no, it is not your fault. No, no, I do not mean it that way. I am just kidding. Look, here is a country with a $1.5 trillion budget, an annual income of over $6 trillion. So you talk about a party raising and spending $150 million in a year and a half for an election, it sounds like a lot of money. Against that, it does not sound like so much money. It just costs a lot of money to communicate. The communications costs-not just on television-radio, print, mail, travel, it is very high. Right. Do you think-so corporations are not getting access? I read a report that they get to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom once in a while, CEO's or-- Well, the people who sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom are people I personally invite, who have been my friends, and a lot of them have supported me. But I do not think any President has made a habit of inviting his opponents to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. I mean, I think you normally invite your supporters. Sure. But I can say this: There is never been any attempt to raise any money with the promise that you can spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. I have invited people who have been helpful to me to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom, but it was never a quid pro quo there. No, I am not trying to imply that. You are doing really well in the polls, but there is a certain percentage of people who not only do not support you but they seem to actively dislike you. Why do some people dislike you so much? Nobody is-- Well, I think-there is a sign on the side of your bus; it is a quote of Bill Cosby's that I just love. He says, I do not know the secret of success. But I know the secret of failure is trying to please everybody. And I have always believed that in public life, when you were given an office, you should outline the major challenges and go after them and really try to get something done. And you should enlist the energies of people and try to bring them together and do it. And I have always had a certain core of people who have opposed me. When I was Governor of my State, I got elected five times and would regularly get nearly two-thirds of the vote. There would always be a core of people who were intensely opposed to my policies. But people did not necessarily like Reagan's policies, either, but it did not seem to get as personal. Do you think it has to do with your generation? Perhaps. And it may be-well, I just do not know. I do not know. It may have more to do with the comparative tactics of the two parties. I have no idea. It may have more to do with the way people are talked about now. One of the reasons I have tried so hard- especially since the Oklahoma City bombing, which I say had a profound impact on our country and on me-I have really tried hard to bring a sense of civility and decency back into public discourse. I went back and read some of my own speeches in '92, and while they are not rough at all by the standards of today, I thought, well, I want to elevate what I am saying and how I am saying it a little more now. I just think that politics has always been a rough-and-tumble business, and people have always disagreed. And if you go back to the early 1800's, for example, it is a period of real tumult in our country, what was said and done and how much people had it pretty rough. I mean, when Thomas Jefferson was elected President, the John Adams party-because Mr. Adams was trying to hold onto the Presidency-said that he would kill religion in America, he would end godliness among the American people. So we have always had some of this, but I think we need to resist it. I remember a very proud group of your inner circle of friends at the convention 4 years ago walking around boasting FOB pins. How does it make you feel that bad things have happened to those who have helped you get where you are today: Jim Guy Tucker, Vince Foster, Webb Hubbell, even the First Lady? Well, I feel very badly, obviously, about Vince Foster because he was my longtime friend, and it is always tragic when someone commits suicide. And I do feel that a lot of people were targeted just because they were from Arkansas. Governor Tucker, for example, had-he was my Lieutenant Governor, we had been friends for a long time, but he'd never been part of my political life. But he was targeted, and I feel badly about that. And the country is going to have to evaluate, when this whole thing is over and there will be time for a fair accounting, whether they think it was the right thing to do. And I feel very badly about Hillary and a lot of her staff have been subject to, because it was just pure naked politics from the get-go. But that is what I am talking about. That is sort of the way of the cycle. It is the cost of doing business in Washington. I mean, the people-- Was that a surprise to you, that it was as harsh as it was? Well, it is just gotten worse and worse. It is been deteriorating over time. Yes, it surprised me that you could be exonerated from one thing after another and it would never be noticed and then just another set of charges just to keep these going. That bothered me. But you know, the thing I think is important that I'd ask the American people to look at is that all these folks in our administration sustained all these hits, and we kept producing for the American people. We said, we cannot control this, we cannot do anything about it; all we can do is get up tomorrow and try to do our job. Why did we come here? We came here to help move the country forward and bring the country together, and that is what we are going to do. And our convention showed how productive our administration had been and our country had been in the last 4 years. And I think the fact that we could do it while having people like Senator D'Amato on us day-in and day-out I think is a tribute to the character and the public devotion of the people in this administration. I am proud of them. That is what I wanted to ask you. If you can just-try to take this in the way that I mean it, but you have suffered incessant character assassination over the past 4 years. Your family has been maligned. You get up, there is another funeral; you have probably only had a couple hours of sleep that night. Between the funeral, a scandal, another country maybe going to war, why do you want 4 more years? I mean, what are you thinking? Well, first of all, there is been a lot more good than bad. Really? Oh, yes. It is the most rewarding thing in the world for a citizen of our country, who loves our country and believes in the promise of its people, to be ENTITY. To look back on the last 4 years and to go out here as I did on the train ride or on this bus trip, and you look into the eyes of people and you go through these crowds, and somebody will say, I have got a home because of one of your programs ; I have gotten a job since you were here ; I am on one of your college loans ; I am an AmeriCorps student -when you see how the country is changing for the better, it is immensely rewarding. And in this day and time-you know, as I said, we have had periods like this in our politics before. In the early 1800's, Mr. Jefferson faced many of the same things. When you live in a time which is really rough, with no holds barred, and a lot of people seek personal advantage by what I call the politics of destruction, you have to be always, always, always defining yourself and the quality of your life by what is inside. And you cannot confuse who you are and the quality of your own life with whatever is going on in the day-to-day headlines. It is destructive. Otherwise, you shrivel and become little. ENTITY should always be trying to be bigger than he is and lifting the country up. And you just have to keep putting that out of your mind; you just have to let it go. I cannot do anything about anything that happened yesterday or even an hour ago; you just have to let that stuff go and keep trying to lift the country up. Well, thank you very much.

{"id": 397, "text": "ENTITY, it is nice to see you. It is nice to meet you. And how are you doing? Welcome. Come on in the Oval Office. I am doing great. Thank you. I welcome you here. And I thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about some of the decisions that I have made right here in this Oval Office. I am honored you have come. Actually, I want to tell the people of the Middle East that this is the place where big decisions are made. This is the office. But here it comes to my mind that how hard it is on you, ENTITY, to take like-a big decision like war, for example-is it that easy to take a decision such like war-- No, it is the hardest decision a President can make. And when I campaigned for office, I never really thought about the decision to put men and women in harm's way. I never thought that that would happen. Circumstances changed, of course, and I had to make some very difficult decisions about how to protect our homeland and take action necessary to- the actions that, I think, will yield the peace. And so whether it be in Afghanistan or Iraq, I was-I have made those decisions. And I will tell you, they are hard decisions, because I understand the consequences. One of the hardest things for me is to meet with a mother. I met with a mother yesterday in Pennsylvania who lost her son in combat. And you know, those can be very tearful and emotional moments, and I understand that. And my-the only thing I try to do is provide as much comfort as I can and to assure the mom, in this case, that I thought the decision was necessary for peace and necessary for our security, and that I valued the fact that her son would volunteer, and that I vowed to honor that sacrifice by achieving our objectives. Anyway, this is the room where I make the decisions. But would these moments-I mean, these emotional moments, would they make you reconsider or rethink about what is going on in our area now? Not really. As a matter of fact, I leave most of the meetings reassured that the loved one, in this case, fully understanding what we were doing. See, I believe that, one, it is noble to liberate 25 million people from a tyrant; two, that we cannot allow Iraq to be a safe haven for people who have sworn allegiance to those who have attacked us. In other words, I believe we must defeat the extremists there so we do not have to face them here at home. And three, I believe the spread of liberty will yield peace. And I believe the Middle East is plenty capable of being a part of the world where liberty flourishes. That is what I believe people want. And so I leave those meetings saddened by the fact that a person has pain in her heart-and yesterday she had pain in her heart-but encouraged by the fact that her son died for a noble cause and a necessary cause. And that is exactly what she told me. Actually, I want to thank you again, ENTITY, for giving us the opportunity to talk for the first time to the Arab world, to address them with the big concerns. I know we have a great deal of questions. I know you have a very tight schedule-- Sure. I want to show you the Rose Garden, one of the most famous areas-- It is a great chance for me. I heard, ENTITY, also, that you are receiving an Iftaar-- Yes, I am. --in the White House, which is, of course, a Muslim ritual It is. But I want to tell you- and I hope this does not bother you at all- that in the Islamic world, they think that ENTITY is an enemy of Islam-- Sure. --that he wants to destroy their religion, what they believe in. Is that in any way true, ENTITY? No, it is not. I have heard that, and it just shows-to show a couple of things: One, that the radicals have done a good job of propagandizing. In other words, they have spread the word that this really is not peaceful people versus radical people or terrorists; this is really about the-America not liking Islam. Well, first of all, I believe in an almighty God, and I believe that all the world, whether they be Muslim, Christian, or any other religion, prays to the same God. That is what I believe. I believe that Islam is a great religion that preaches peace. And I believe people who murder the innocent to achieve political objectives are not religious people, whether they be a Christian who does that-we had a person blow up our-blow up a Federal building in Oklahoma City who professed to be a Christian. But that is not a Christian act, to kill innocent people. Exactly. And I just simply do not subscribe to the idea that murdering innocent men, women, and children-particularly Muslim men, women, and children in the Middle East-is an act of somebody who is a religious person. We are having an Iftaar dinner tonight- I say, we -it is my wife and I. This is the seventh one in the 7 years I have been the President. It gives me a chance to say Ramadan Mubarak. The reason I do this is, I want people to understand about my country. In other words, I hope this message gets out of America. I want people to understand that one of the great freedoms in America is the right for people to worship any way they see fit. If you are a Muslim, an agnostic, a Christian, a Jew, a Hindu, you are equally American. And the value-the most valuable thing I think about America is that-particularly if you are a religious person-you can be free to worship, and it is your choice to make. It is not the state's choice, and you should not be intimidated after you have made your choice. And that is a right that I jealously guard. Secondly, I want American citizens to see me hosting an Iftaar dinner. That is a strong message for the Americans. It is a strong message. I want to remind your listeners that one of the first things I did after September the 11th is, I went to the local mosque. And I did because I wanted to send a message that those who came to kill Americans were young terrorists, and they do not reflect the views of the vast majority of peaceful people in the Middle East; and that our-precisely the message I was trying to send, the war is not a struggle against Muslims, the Muslim religion; it is a struggle of honorable, peaceful people throughout the world against the few who want to impose their vision. Actually, ENTITY, we are talking about these terrorists and what is going on in the world right now. Are you also a man of war, as some try to describe, ENTITY? Oh, no, no, I believe the actions we have taken will make it more likely peace happens. I dream it will be- the last thing I want to be is a President during war. Now, remember, we got attacked. And I responded, after careful deliberation, in an attempt to make sure that-with a strategy of protecting ourselves. We cannot allow these people that attacked us to have safe haven. We must not give them an opportunity to strike us again. And therefore, it is important to keep the pressure on. On the other hand, the ultimate way for peace is for people to realize the great blessings of liberty. And what is interesting-and what has taken place ought to be hopeful to people in the Middle East- is that two young democracies have sprung up where people, when given a chance, voted. See, I believe there is a universal God. I believe the God that the Muslim prays to is the same God that I pray to. After all, we all came from Abraham. I believe in that universality. And I believe a gift of that Almighty to every man, woman, and child is freedom; I really do. And I think people, if given a chance, will seize freedom. And it is liberty and free societies, not-they do not have to look like America-an Iraqi democracy is going to be Iraqi; it is going to reflect Iraqi traditions and Iraqi history. There are some universal aspects to liberty: One, people can vote; people can express their opinion; people can be in a free press; people ought to be allowed to go to the town square and protest against their government without fear of reprisal. And when given that opportunity, 12 million Iraqis went to the polls. So excuse me, ENTITY, what you are trying to say is, sometimes a decision of war-you have to take a decision of war in order to achieve peace. That is exactly right. And that is what happened in Iraq. First of all, yes. I was very concerned about the dictator in Iraq. He was an enemy of the United States of America. He had ties to terrorists-I am not saying those who attacked us on September the 11th, but I am saying ties to terrorists. He had a lot of money that he was willing to spend on weapons of mass destruction. We did not find the weapons, but he certainly had the knowledge. And in my judgment, over time, he would have been able to develop those weapons, and they would have been-one thing the Middle East does not need is a nuclear arms race. Yes, we are going to discuss this. Well, this guy does not - the man, Saddam Hussein, had capability; but remember, there is also a human condition. I believe in human rights. I believe every life has value, whether it be an American life or a life of a person in the Middle East. And this brutal guy killed hundreds of thousands of his own people. And he was unbelievably brutal to neighbors and, as well, to Iraqis. And there is -liberation is a powerful-to me, liberating people is a powerful step toward peace. I wish we did not have to do this militarily. I was hoping that diplomacy would work. I gave diplomacy a lot of chance to work. But it did not . It did not work. So the choice was his, not mine. He had the choice as to whether or not this issue would be resolved peacefully. See, that is the interesting thing that has been turned around. And so I do not regret the decision. As a matter of fact, I feel it was the right decision to this day. And now the question is, will America keep its commitment to the millions of Iraqis who want this society to work? And the answer to that is, yes, we will. And here, ENTITY, I would love to ask-I mean, for the Iraqis now, they know and they keep on listening to the news. Sometimes we tell them we want to withdraw the troops. And now we are talking about the partition of Iraq, which is very, very bad news for the Iraqis. Yes, it is. I know you refused this. You want the unity of Iraq. But what if this Iraqi-what if, in the next administration, another President comes to the office and believes in the partition of Iraq? What is going to happen then? I do not think it will happen. I do not think it is going to happen. How do you guarantee? Well, first of all, an American President must understand that Iraq is a sovereign nation operating under its own Constitution. And I am very confident that the will of Iraq will prevail. And I know there is some noise out of here about partition. But most folks who follow this issue do not support partition, and they do not think it is a good idea. What Iraq is going to have to do is get the proper balance between the central Government and the Provinces, the very same thing we have been worried about here in America for years. What is the right road between the States and Washington? So that is a constant discussion. But that is what they are going to have to do in Iraq as well. And they are going to need the security situation such that they are able to have an honest political discourse. So our step one was to help them secure their neighborhoods-and it is working- and make sure these radicals, such as Al Qaida and some of these Shi'a groups, many of whom-which are criminal, are not able to have their way with this society. And now we will work toward helping these folks have the important discussion about what should be the role of Baghdad, or what should be the role of the Provincial governments. And when they get that right, when they get settled out, then I think you will see a much more unified country. And it is going to be very hard for an American President or any other outside country to dictate to the Iraqis, Here is what your government must look like, because the Iraqis will show over time that they are capable of making these decisions themselves, and they are making hard decisions right now, by the way. I know that your message, your deep message was-to the Arab world-was democracy, freedom, human rights. And you have said too many times that the first message is democracy, is that you have rights, you people of the Middle East, to be free. But now, is democracy still a priority? Because all we hear now in Iraq is, let us achieve security; let us achieve stability. Is democracy in the Middle East on hold now, waiting for security first? Well, first of all, no. I strongly believe in the freedom movement. It is ingrained in my soul. It comes from my belief that freedom is universal. And I believe freedom is ingrained in everybody's soul, and if just given a chance, they will reach for it. Now, in Iraq, in order for the Government to have breathing space, to be able to do the hard work of reconciliation so that the dreams of the average citizen in Iraq can be realized-which is a free society-there is got to be security. And so security is really a step, an important step, in the freedom movement. You cannot make the decisions if you are worried about getting blown up. And what the enemy wants to do, the enemy of a free Iraq, they want to create enough chaos and confusion inside Iraq that causes people to doubt. And they want, by the way, to kill enough innocent people that causes the American people to lose their patience and determination to help freedom movements. Not every freedom movement requires military action. But freedom movement does require U.S. commitment to helping reformers and just the average citizen realize the blessings of a free society. And so the freedom movement is the front and center of our foreign policy because I understand that the peace that we want-listen, we all want peace, except for those who are trying-- Except for those, exactly. But peace will succeed as more and more people become free. ENTITY, we have moved from the Oval Office to the beautiful garden, and here I would like to ask you question that go through the minds of the Arab world. Our world is going through very difficult days. Let me start with what people expect of me, which is Iran. ENTITY, have you made the decision to strike Iran, as some are saying, or trying to say that you will not leave your administration and office before you strike Iran militarily? I have made the commitment that I would continue to work with the world to speak with one voice to the Iranians, to the Iranian Government, that we will work in ways that we can to make it clear to you that you should not have the know-how on how to make a weapon, because one of the great threats to peace and the world would be if Iranians showed up with a nuclear weapon. It would give them an opportunity to blackmail or threaten or possibly follow through with their stated objective, which is the destruction of Israel. I, of course, said all options are on the table, but I made a pledge to the American people, we will work diplomatically to solve the problem. And that is why you see us at the United Nations working with the EU countries and China and Russia to send that clear message, and that we are going to continue to impose sanctions and make it harder for the Iranian Government to operate in the world until they change their mind, until they come to a new way forward. I have said that if they suspend their nuclear program, we will be at the table. But they have so far refused to do that. I have also spoken to the Iranian people. And I want to make it clear to the people of Iran that the United States respects Iran, respects the people, respects the proud tradition, and that the Government of Iran has taken decisions that make it harder for them to live their lives. It is the decisions of the Government of Iran that have led to the isolation of the country. And that if this Government would only be responsible, would listen to the world, would not continue its weapons program-the idea of being able to have the capacity to make a weapon-then there is a better way forward for the Iranian people. But, ENTITY, is there a redline, either a timeline or redline- I hear from analysts that Iran wants today, or at least trying today to buy time in order for you to wait-to lose the time that you can make a big decision, such as going to war. In your judgment, is there a timetable? Is there a ceiling that if negotiations would fail, a decision to go to war would be made? The Iranian regime must understand that I am dedicated to the proposition that they should not continue their desire to enrich, as will be people that follow me in office. There is universal concern about Iranian ambition here in America. This is not a party issue, an issue between one party or the other. When the Iranian President announces to the world that he is going to destroy an ally or announces to the world that he will end up defying the world-that-no matter who the President is, there is going to be a continued focus and effort to achieve this issue, to resolve this issue. This issue, before I move to Iraq, which also, a lot of Iraqis are waiting for this-is there-there are some leaking to the press, and particularly the Arabic press-is it true that you have issued orders, ENTITY, to your senior generals in the American military to prepare for a major and precise strike that could happen during the end of January or February? I would call that empty propaganda. Evidently, there is a lot of gossip in parts of the country-world that try to scare people about me, personally, or my country or what we stand for. And that kind of gossip is just what it is: It is gossip; it is baseless gossip. ENTITY, we have talked about Iraq. And you have tried to give us a message to assure the Iraqi people-when we were in the garden together-that you do not believe in the partition or the division of Iraq. And this is a very controversial issue in Iraq. And it is scary to even some of the leadership in Iraq. Just to continue and follow up with that issue, did we reach what we reached because of American mistakes or because of Iraqi mistakes and the Iraqi Government? I think, first of all, the successes in Iraq have been really quite extraordinary. One, the people of Iraq no longer have to live under a dictatorship, a brutal dictatorship. Secondly, the Iraqi people wrote and ratified a modern Constitution. Thirdly, there is a Government that is in place that is beginning to take on the responsibilities of governing. For example, quite a few billions have been spent in the Provinces by the central Government. That does not get any focus, but there is a functioning Government; there is revenue sharing; there is money to the Provinces. There is still work to be done, no question about it. But the biggest problem facing Iraq was because killers, bombers decided to murder innocent people in order to stop progress. So what I tell people is, is that the reason why there has not been smooth progress-and by the way, it is hard to transition from a dictatorship to a Iraqi democracy-but the main problem has been not the Iraqis or not the United States, but it is been the fact that people have murdered. For example, what I find appalling is that Al Qaida bombed a holy site, a Muslim holy site; that there have been bombs in markets where innocent people are shopping and young children get destroyed by Muslim-people who profess to be Muslims. Their hearts are so hardened that they are willing to kill innocent people. And so the task is to deny these people their ability to blow up the innocent. And that is exactly what is happening because of Iraqi bravery and Iraqi forces and a commitment by the Government to deal with murderers. See, I believe murderers murder, and it does not matter whether you are a Shi'a murderer or a Sunni murderer or a Christian murderer, you are a murderer. And the role of a state is to protect the innocent people from those murderers. And that is what you are seeing taking place in Iraq. But in the meantime, government is beginning to function better. But people should not be surprised that it is not instant democracy. First of all, the leaders never have had any practice with democracy, and they are learning to get along after years of tension and resentment. I support Prime Minister Maliki strongly, and I support the Presidency Council strongly. I just had President Talabani in to the Oval Office the other day. And the reason I do is because-I look for courage and commitment. And these leaders are courageous men, and they are committed to a free Iraq. Has it been perfect progress? No. Is there more work to be done? You bet there is more work to be done. But are things better-getting better over time? Yes, they are. And that is what is important for the American people to know. And what is important for the Iraqi people to know is that we are going to support them, is that they have got our help because we want them to succeed. We want them to realize their dreams. ENTITY, so the words that were said attributing to the White House or the American position about disappointment in Prime Minister Maliki is not true? You are not disappointed in Prime Minister Maliki and this Iraqi Government yet? I strongly support Prime Minister Maliki. Again, there is a lot of gossip here, as well as overseas. One of the jobs that I have to continue to do is constantly repeat what-the position of my Government. And the position of my Government is that Prime Minister Maliki is a good man who is working hard, and we strongly support him. But it is not just Prime Minister Maliki that we support, we also support President Talabani or Vice President Al-Mahdi or Vice President Hashimi. We support those who are committed to peace and committed to the welfare of the Iraqi people. And we support those who are willing to take on these extremists, the few who are murdering innocent people in order to create chaos and confusion inside of Iraq. Again, I repeat: The situation is not perfect, but our country is not perfect. And I am proud of the courage of the Iraqi citizens. The Iraqis have been through a lot of bloodshed and violence, and yet they are still strong in their desire to achieve. The Iraqis will be successful. ENTITY, let us move to Lebanon. And a lot of Lebanese are waiting. You have met with Mr. Sa'ad Hariri today, and they are all talking about the upcoming elections in Lebanon that could or could not happen. Does ENTITY have a specific, preferred candidate in Lebanon that you wanted to support for the Presidency of Lebanon? Is there going to be elections in Lebanon that will take place? No, I have no specific candidate, and I told that to Sa'ad Hariri. I have a deep desire to help the Lebanese democracy succeed. I am deeply concerned about foreign interference into the Presidential election. I am concerned that neighboring countries will try to create instability so that this democracy does not succeed, just like I am deeply concerned that there is been murder on the streets of Beirut, including Sa'ad Hariri's dad, and that the international community must follow through in an expeditious way-must follow through quickly in holding-in having an international tribunal, so that those who murdered-so that the facts come out and those who murdered would be held to account. There is just too many parliamentarians who are trying to work for a peaceful Lebanon being assassinated. And we need to know who is doing that assassinations. And when they are found out, they need to be held to account; there needs to be a consequence. And the international community has been too slow in getting the international tribunal moving. Thirdly, I told Sa'ad Hariri that I sent one of our top military men into Lebanon to help them modernize their armed forces. And the reason I felt comfortable doing that is because Prime Minister Siniora showed courage and had-as did the Lebanese forces when they went out to rout out some extremists who were causing chaos or trying to cause chaos in Lebanon. And yet it became apparent to me that this military was full of courageous people but did not have the modern equipment necessary to defend the country from extremists and/or extremists who had been funded from outside influence. This is a very difficult situation. I am hopeful that obviously the Presidency will be resolved and that a unified government can move forward. Sa'ad Hariri shared with me the strategy of the March 14th coalition, and I was more than willing to listen. I assured him and I assure the Lebanese people that we want to help you succeed. ENTITY, are we able to say today, for example, to the Lebanese people-and we know that the United States is the most powerful constituency in Lebanon-can we say to the Lebanese people that you, specifically, ENTITY, will prevent any foreign interference in Lebanon that could be imposed from the outside and have a President that is being promoted by outside force? I think maybe that is a promise that I am not sure I could keep, because the one thing that we did was, we worked with France to pass a U.N. resolution to get Syria, Syrian presence, visible presence, out of Lebanon. However, I suspect that there is still a lot of Syrian influence in Lebanon that is not helpful. And one way to make it clear to the Asad Government that we do not appreciate this is for the United States to-is to analyze the sanctions we have placed on the Government and think about other ways to continue to send a message and to work with our friends, particularly in Europe, to send the same message. In other words, there has to be a consequence for continued involvement. And the other thing is, is that I think it is going to be an important signal to send-is this tribunal. The international community said we ought to have a tribunal. I am frustrated frankly by the pace at which the tribunal is lingering; it is not moving. There needs to be a definitive moment where the evidence is laid out, and if it is clear evidence-in other words, if somebody's guilty, they ought to be held to account so that murder is not-so that there is this clear signal that murder is not going to be accepted. The brave souls of Lebanon who are being killed-Sa'ad Hariri's dad was one, blown up, murdered. Why? Because he supported democracy. Lebanese democracy is for freedom. And that ought to send a clear message to people throughout the world that it is so important for those of us who live in free societies to support brave people who are promoting liberty. This man wanted nothing more than the Lebanese mom to be able to raise her child in peace. And yet somebody ordered or somebody followed through with coldblooded murder to deny those dreams for the Lebanese people. And the same thing is happening in Iraq, and it is unacceptable behavior. And the United States is firm in its desire to help the average citizen in the Middle East live in peace. It just so happens a peaceful Middle East will make America more secure. So we have common interests. And that is really what I want the people in the Middle East to hear, that each issue is an issue that is got difficult problems, but there is an interconnection. Extremists want to stop freedom, though. And we want you to live in peace. And we respect your religion, and we respect your humanity. And our desire for you is to realize your full potential, God-given potential. ENTITY, of course I cannot conclude this interview without asking the most important question, that is the issue of Palestine. Is ENTITY convinced, truly convinced inside, that it is possible yet to achieve peace between Israel and Palestine? Can we achieve the two states, living side by side, and not as two enemies but two friends? Is it possible or is it difficult or impossible to achieve? I believe in my soul, in my heart, that not only is it necessary that there be two states living side by side in order to achieve peace, but it is possible. I am very optimistic we can achieve a two-state solution. First, Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas are committed to a two-state solution and are making progress. We have done a lot of dialog between the two men, and they are making progress. And they are making progress that-I believe-where the average Palestinian and average Israeli will begin to see what a vision looks like; in other words, something to work for, something that is more tangible than just a Rose Garden speech by the President or hopeful comments by others-something real. Secondly, that-you know, we are hosting a international conference that will be attended by interested parties-the Arab League, you know, important Arab League group will be there; a committee will be there from the Arab League. And it is an opportunity for there to be a serious-substantive discussions about the way forward and a two-state solution. A lot of it is going to be empower both parties, give them confidence to follow through on the vision. I also want you to know that I fully understand the two-state solution is a part of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and that our strategy is to get all concerned countries to the table; to get this comprehensive peace moving forward in a way that is tangible and real, so people can see it. In other words, I am not interested in just a photo opportunity, and I do not think anybody else is going to be interested in that. I really want to see if we can advance the progress. Step one was for there to be a commitment by Israel and the Palestinians to this peace. And step two is a commitment to the roadmap. In other words, nobody is going to want-have a state that becomes a launching pad for attack. The Palestinians-the average Palestinian does not want that, and surely the Abbas Government does not , and Israel cannot stand that. And so we have got-we got to work a lot with the Palestinians to help their security forces-and we are-and to help the President and the Prime Minister with economic aid, tangible economic aid so the average Palestinian can see a better life ahead, can realize there is something better than violence. And so I am very optimistic about it, about the prospects for peace. Steven told me that time is over, ENTITY. Could you just- a few seconds, if you allow me. And since I wanted to go ask you that question when we, after-20 days after commemorating September 11th, I said, when I meet ENTITY, I am going to ask him a question. This massacre that happened on 9/11, it is very difficult for any Arab who lives in the Arab world that can imagine what happened to innocent American people on that day. I would like to know what was your reaction the first time when you heard that 15 Saudi Muslims were among the hijackers who committed this crime and this terrorist act? How did that affect your relationship with the Kingdom-which plays a major role in the region-and particularly Crown Prince Abdallah-now King Abdallah-who is a personal friend of yours? King Abdallah is a personal friend of mine, and I respect him. You know, I have seen murder before in my own country. I have seen evil people take innocent life. And when that is happened, I have not condemned everybody else around. I will give you an interesting story. I was in a community yesterday-a gunman came and killed five young Amish girls- this is last year. And the gunman was killed. The Amish community, which is a religious community here in America, went and reached out to the wife and children of the gunman in compassion and love. And I am not saying I was that-you know, I hope I could be that compassionate. It was a great act of compassion. And the reason I tell you that is, my reaction on September the 11th was, I vowed to find the killers-those who ordered the killing-and bring them to justice. On the other hand, never did it enter my heart and my mind to be embittered toward a group of people, innocent people, who had nothing to do with the murderer. In other words, I was focused on the individuals and their commanders, not citizens in the Middle East, of any country, particularly Saudi Arabia. In other words, my first reaction was not, look, the Saudis are bad people. My first reaction was, evil people came and killed, and we will react to protect ourselves. And we will react to protect ourselves in two ways. One is to work with concerned governments, including Saudi Arabia, to find those few that are willing to murder us. And those same murderers that came to the United States would very much like to murder the leaders in Saudi Arabia. And so there is a lot of common ground throughout the world to rout out people and to bring them to justice. And the long term-these people believe something. There is an ideology behind their views, and the ideology basically is very different from one based upon freedom. Their ideology is, you cannot worship the way you see fit. And if you do not worship the way they want you to worship, you will be publicly beaten, or you will be killed, or you will be in prison. They do not believe, for example, young girls ought to be educated. I strongly disagree with that. I think one of the great potentials of the Middle East is women. And I certainly know, as a father, that I want my little girls to be-you know, have a good education, which they did. And I am confident other fathers want the same thing in the Middle East, even though we may not speak the same language or share the same religion. And so my reaction was-tough reaction to make sure we find those who ordered the killing and bring them to justice and to keep the pressure on them so they do not do it again-and I believe they want to do it again. But on the other hand, I have this sense of a possibility based upon something that is worked throughout the world, and that is, people being able to realize dreams through liberty. This is not the first time that societies have had to make choices. This is not the first time where people made the focused effort to become a free society. And it will not be the first time when a part of the world has gone from one that is been tense and full of unspeakable tragedy to one of peace. And that is where we are headed; we are headed to peace. And I cannot thank you enough for the opportunity to speak on a free channel to people throughout the Middle East. Our country is a loving country. It is hard for me to believe that people cannot look at America and say, Wow, what a compassionate group of people -because we are. And yet I understand the images of my country have been distorted. And I understand people say things about me personally that simply are not true. And so I appreciate the chance to come and talk to you directly and to talk to your viewers directly about what is in my heart and about the fact that my country is a country of peace. ENTITY, on behalf of myself and Al Arabiya TV, I would like to thank you very much for this opportunity. You were very generous with us on time; I know you have a very hectic schedule. Thank you very much for this opportunity. And I hope to meet with you again when you also are in a position to achieve some of our democracy in our region.

{"id": 502, "text": "The 40th ENTITY When historians write about the Reagan administration, what do you want them to say? You know, I have been asked that, and I guess I have to say, I have never thought that far ahead. I am so busy thinking about what we want to accomplish. I guess maybe just that I helped perpetuate this great American dream. What do you hope for in the next 3 years? There are so many things. I would like to get us definitely on the pattern of reducing the deficit so that the balanced budget is in view. I would like to have, then, going into effect at that time a balanced budget amendment so we could never again go a half a century, as we have, of regularly deficit spending each year. And I would like to see us also have some plan for beginning installments to start reducing the national debt, as we have done many times in the past. There are a number of things that I would like to see resolve the problem of prayer in schools and have us on the road, a good solid road that could make us optimistic about the chances for peace. On the budget deficit, it seems as if members of your own party are not totally in accord with you. The Congress has not supported you. Are you optimistic? David Stockman said maybe this is the last chance, but you are optimistic about the future? Yes, I am. There is no way that anyone could ever balance the budget in 1 year. This budget, over the years, has been structurally built into our budgeting process. And the difficulty, of course, is getting agreement not on the need to reduce it everyone seems to agree on that but then trying to get them to agree on, well, where do you apply the tourniquet and shut off that hemorrhage of funds. But I think that we are on the beginning of a track where we can see a progression of reducing the deficit as a percentage of gross national product. You know, if you just count the deficit in dollars and it looks so horrifying and you say, How did this ever happen? Well, if you look at it back over these 50 years of deficit spending on the basis of what it is as a percentage of gross national product, that, too, has been growing bigger. So, it is not as far out of line with past deficits; some of them were just about as big as this one is in that percentage. But if we can get on a percentage to where, for these next 3 years what we have in mind is if we can get it next year down to 4 percent of the gross national product, 3 percent the following year, 2 percent the next year, we think that that progression will point us to, by 1990, a balanced budget and then you could have go into effect the balanced budget amendment. I spoke to an influential Republican Senator on Sunday who felt that, possibly, the tax reform measure might be diverting attention away from deficit reduction. Do you see that as a complement to it or possibly a stimulant for it? Actually, a stimulant for it in a way, because if you look back, not just in our administration and what we did in 1981 when we implemented or began implementing our tax cuts, but go back to President Kennedy's across-the-board tax cut, before that to President Coolidge and the tax cuts that he implemented in every instance the economic growth has resulted in the Government getting more revenues at the lower rates than it was getting at the higher rates. So, I think this tax reform very definitely would help. It is not aimed at being a part of that, but it would help in that it would stimulate economic growth and I think would actually, thus, result in increased revenues. This has been spoken of as a profamily tax measure. How will that help the families in your estimate? Well, let us start right off with someone down there at the lower end of the earning scale. One of the features of this is that the personal exemption is increased to $4,000 and then the deduction for dependents is almost doubled to $2,000 apiece instead of the present 1,040. So, you take a family of four, you have got $8,000 of nontaxable income to begin with right there. And that plus the reduced rates we believe that and first of all, so many of our people cannot and do not take advantage of many of the loopholes that others have been able to use to reduce their fair share of the tax burden. So, it is very definitely aimed at families and that was sort of proven the other day when the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives-so, I am not just citing a Republican measure-in the Committee on Children, Youth, and Family have made a study of this tax proposal plus all the others that are before the Congress and said flatly this one is the most profamily of all of the tax proposals. Is the $2,000 personal exemption, dependent's exemption, is that a non-negotiable feature? Would you veto a bill if it did not have that in it? I think it just has to have it, and let me give you my thinking on that. Some years ago, as you know, that deduction was $600 and then inflation took hold and has kept coming on. And finally, someone got around to increasing the 600 to 1,040. But right now, actually, if we had kept up with inflation, the deduction should be $2,700. Now, we could not remain revenue neutral and go that high, but going to $2,000 is eminently justified simply on the matter of that actually, in purchasing power, that is smaller than the $600 was back in 1948. There is no lobby for it, though; among the people, the vast numbers will help. So would you, in a sense, be their champion and go the mount on that issue? Yes, and I have to say, though, that I have not heard here, from Democrats or Republicans, any objection to those figures. There have been some of the loopholes or deductions, other areas that people have thought should be retained, and there is been argument about that. But I have not heard anyone raise a complaint about these personal exemptions. One oblique question. I read that the reason that you and Franklin Roosevelt were so tremendously popular is because you gave the American people hope. Looking down the road, what cause do you have for hope? Well, I am an eternal optimist, I know; but I cannot help but have hope. Just a few years ago, we were seeing our streets torn up with rioting and demonstrations of various kinds, but we also were seeing a lack of hope. We were hearing talk that we were no longer a nation of growth and so forth; that we must begin to limit ourselves in our expectations, and our government itself was telling that to the people. And here, today, in these few short years, double-digit inflation is down to less than 4 percent and still on its way down; interest rates, the prime rate had reached 21 1/2 percent, and it is down to far less than a half of that now, and still, I believe, they are going down. In the last 33 months, we have created more than 8 million new jobs. And today you know what is referred to as the employment pool is everyone in the United States male and female between the age of 16 and 65 are known as the potential labor pool that if all of them sought work they are all employable. The highest percentage of that labor pool is employed now than has ever been employed before in our history. And the growth in the recovery has been the greatest that we have known in any recovery from any previous recession or depression. But even more than that, there is something out there you get out on the road and talk to the people. There is a spirit. Our young people, who once were, as you know, totally disillusioned with government and so forth over the Vietnam war the resurgence of patriotism among them. And now with our volunteer military no longer having to have a draft I do not know of anything I am more proud of than our young men and women in uniform and their spirit. I ask you a question for the women viewers in our audience. You have just gone through a very critical medical problem, and we know how close you and your wife Nancy are. It is almost a fabled love affair better than Hollywood could do it. What was her reaction? How did she handle this crisis? Well, she is very courageous, and once upon a time when she was younger she was one of those what did they call them those nurses aides that-during war time and all. So, that part, she was on the Job. But she also is a very great worrier, and let me put it this way: I have recovered quicker than she did. It was a terrible crisis. This is the second one. Some of your very close friends from California have gone back into private enterprise or gone back home. Are you turning more to your wife for counsel? She is a very wise lady. Oh, listen, we have always talked over everything together. I could not imagine it being otherwise. But as to the people leaving the administration, I have expected that. I had 8 years experience in California. And I made it plain from the beginning that these people I would take them even if it was only for a year or 2 years and then find someone else if and when they had to return to their own careers. And I think it should be that way if you are going to get well, I always put it this way. I wanted people in government that really did not want a job in government, but that were willing to come and serve rather than those that were seeking government jobs. And the result is, you know that they will have to go back to their own careers sooner or later. But, no, Nancy and I we do not have any secrets from each other. We were very heartened to learn that Reverend Weir had been released from Lebanon, and word reached us that a member of the White House staff was dispatched on Sunday, I believe, to Iran to seek the release of the remaining six and actually it was seven at that time. Is there any word on that that might give hope to us? Well, I cannot really talk about what we are doing, because I do not want to do anything that will endanger the prospects of the others being freed. I can only say that we have explored every avenue. We have been working for this for all the time since the first one, Mr. Buckley, was kidnaped. And I know that some of the families have grown impatient, because if they do not see things in the paper, they do not think we are doing anything. But going public and being in the paper is not the way to get a Reverend Weir back or any of the others. Could we say cautiously optimistic, or is there anything that we can say to characterize it? I have to remain cautiously optimistic. And we are continuing the efforts that and we have explored and been trying in every avenue that is open to us. But, again, it is something I cannot talk about because, as I say, there is a risk in all of this for them. You are getting ready for the summit. Is the American press and a free press is so important in our nation but is it from time to time being manipulated by the Soviet Union to sort of stack the deck against you in this summit meeting? Well, I did begin to feel there for a while that when the summit started they'd be rooting for the other side; that he was wearing the white hat, and I was wearing the black hat. You know, that is an old Hollywood expression, that you identify the villain as I know. by the color of the hat. I think what should be better understood by our people and this is not any criticism of our press the Soviet Union has a worldwide disinformation network, and it is very effective. And they can get many things published and broadcast and so forth to suit their ends and in their drives, for example, to try to create some friction among us and our allies. And I do not think we have anything comparable to that. One last question. I see that our time has run out. If the Congress gives you a trade protectionist bill having either a tariff or a surcharge or some other name, will you veto it? I will have to. That is one of the advantages of being my age. I was looking for work in the Great Depression, and I know what the Smoot-Hawley bill did, the world trade war that it created. There is no way that that can win protectionism for, say, a particular industry no one ever looks over their shoulder to see how many people in other industries lost their jobs-because it is a two-way street, and retaliation sets in. We are still the greatest exporter in the world. And even though there is a great trade imbalance right now, that we are importing far more than we are exporting, that is not because we have reduced our exports, as big as they ever were. We have increased our imports because of the value of our dollar and the fact that our trading partners have not had the economic recovery we have had, so their prices are low. And you cannot blame people for picking up a bargain. What they need is a dose of Reaganomics in Europe, is that what you say? Exactly. As a matter of fact, they themselves admit that in their systems there are so many rigidities in labor laws and everything else that have been built in that they have not had the recovery. Indeed, when I was at the recent economic summit, the last summit in May, they called to my face, they called what we have is the miracle of America. So, we have tried to pass on to them information that we think would help them have some miracles. ENTITY, thank you so much. This has been wonderful. Well ENTITY God bless you. Well, thank you very much, and, in saying that, let me tell you, when you asked about the future and why I was optimistic and all, I am convinced this is a nation under God and as long as we recognize that, believe that, I think he will help us. There is no question about it. That is the greatest cause for optimism I know of. Thank you very much, sir.

{"id": 279, "text": "ENTITY, you know that the problem in Colombia is the fighting of this drug problem. And the newspapers in Colombia are very much in front of this thing. Yes. And we are fighting very strongly. We have been suffering a lot. But there is a concern in our country that in the United States there is not enough control and enough punishment on the consumption and distribution of the drugs. Yes. I personally had an experience just 2 weeks ago. I was in New York. I was invited to the Waldorf Astoria for dinner. And the person who invited me came to the Grand Central and walked from the Grand Central to the Waldorf Astoria, and in that short walk, four people offered him drugs. So, I say, why does this happen? Is it in the United States that there is not enough control and enough punishment, enough action in that way? So, what can you tell our readers about that? Mr. Cano first, I strongly supported what President Barco said when he called attention of the world and certainly the United States to the consumption problem. We have no argument with that he is right. And what I am trying to do in our new antidrug strategy is to go after not only the criminals that sell drugs to your friend in those two blocks but the people that use it. We are coupling with that an all-out education program that is not just government but private sector as well. And I might say that it is not just, regrettably, one country, the United States, that is a user. What concerns me and other leaders is that it is going not only into some countries in our own hemisphere, South America, but all through Europe. And I asked the Soviets if they had a problem with it, and it is everywhere. But I think when President Barco, my respected friend, pointed out, look, you have got to do something about consumption, he was right. And I have used that in speaking to leadership groups in this room and in others to try to encourage support for our antinarcotics program, which still does have strong support in our country, and for the legislation we need, getting tougher on the people that sell it, and for the education, of educating against being a user. ENTITY, Argentina is trying to restructure its highly inefficient economy. And that implies some degree of social tensions. And President Menem was here recently to explain some of these goals. What was your perception of these goals and these problems? And what do you think the U.S. can do to assist or help a country like Argentina dealing with these economic and social problems? In the first place, I was most impressed with President Menem not just here when he came to visit but at the United Nations when we sat together and had a chance to have a quick meeting. I think there is been a universal respect for what he is tried to do. He came out of one political background, and he has broadened the appeal not just to have support in the Argentine but in the United States as well. I told him we want to work with him on the debt problem. I realize it is not easy because Argentina does have a very large debt. But the elements of the Brady plan are there, and they can be very helpful to him. We want to encourage and be helpful in privatization, and I think there is ways that we can encourage investment in Argentina, given these political reforms. So, it is across the board; it is not just one program. But the thing that is impressed me is the toughness of the man and his willingness to make the tough decisions on getting his economic house in order and, indeed, what he is doing on the political front. So, I think you will see a whole new relationship between Argentina and the United States. This is on my mind because the Argentinian Ambassador presented his credentials yesterday, and well, he really said just about what I am saying here in terms of the feeling in Argentina about the United States. And I want to encourage as many of our top people to go there as possible; work closely with the finance people, the environment people, the military, whatever it is. So, we have a new era bilaterally; and I think, universally, there is a respect for what he is trying to do. ENTITY, in countries returning to democracy, like Chile and so many others, what is the importance of the following three threats: first is subversion; second, the tensions in the military suspected of violation of human rights; and third, the economy and the foreign debt? Just to comment on each of those? Yes. Subversion: nobody is interested in doing anything other than to help stop possible subversion. Because as Chile moves towards its elections within the next few weeks, this is a very significant development; and it is one that, in my view, can result speaking as ENTITY in better relations with our country. On the military violations, this obviously is a matter where the people of Chile and the Government and everybody else has to respond. There is not much we can do about it. But I do not want to see in any country a military subvert the will of the people when democracy is on the move in this hemisphere a general answer to a specific question. And then the third one was what? The foreign debt and the economy. Foreign debt? Well, of course, Chile has been out in front of other countries in managing its economy, in spite of its difficulties in some areas. We talked about the politics, the political problem. But Chile, because of its I would not say economic miracle, but they have done far better. And the elements of support from the international institutions and again, on the Third World debt or their debt problems are in place pretty much in Chile. So, I am somewhat optimistic about their being about to cope financially, at least as we see it from the United States. I think people see that Chile has done very well, relatively speaking. ENTITY, in spite of superpower negotiations on regional issues, Soviet-bloc arms continue to pour into Nicaragua. From January 1st to September 30th of the current year, there were 55 shipments, valued at over $400 million State Department figures. What does your government plan to do about this? And do you plan to bring this up at the coming summit in San Jose? I will bring it up every chance I get. And what we are trying to do is educate our friends in Europe and people who strongly support democracy all over the world that this is happening. I think people do not believe it. And it is true. Secondly, we will continue to work with the Soviet Union. We had a little argument not argument, but they felt we had challenged their word on this whole question, as you remember, not so many weeks ago. And we were not doing that. We were pointing out the totality of the shipments, which are in the range that you have just outlined here. So, we will make clear every chance we get to the Soviets that that is not in their interests, and certainly we view it against the security interests of the United States, and we view it against the tide in terms of democracy. Why should that military clique, who at one point were espousing their own Marxist beliefs, deny, through having a military force far bigger than is required and bigger than any of its neighbors, the will of the people? So, it is a combination of these things. And I will be pleased to discuss it in Costa Rica; in Washington, DC; or anyplace else. And I think there is a little more understanding now in our country about it, but not as much as there should be, see, because the regime keeps denying this, you see. ENTITY, according to the Tela accords, which were signed recently by the five Central American Presidents, the Nicaraguan resistance must be demobilized and voluntarily repatriated by December 8th. With the economy of my country in terrible shape, Honduras is insisting that the resistance leave its territory by this date, December 8th. If the resistance does not want to return voluntarily to Nicaragua, for whatever reason, will the United States take them? And will you take this up with President Azcona when you meet with him in San Jose on Friday? There were two conditions under Tela: one was voluntary repatriation, and I think the other was to democratic conditions, or something of that nature. And so, those two are the sine qua nons of demobilization, it seems to me. And so, I can sympathize; and, yes, I will be glad to discuss it further with President Azcona. I understand it does cause some differences, but I do not want to push for anything other than voluntary and then demobilization into democratic conditions. So, I think the major objective here should be to see that these elections are free and fair and that opposition and, yes, we will help with repatriation on those conditions, absolutely; we will help. But I must insist that all of us in this hemisphere and I will try to insist on this do what we can to be sure that these elections coming up in Nicaragua are free and fair and that the opposition has a chance to take its case to the people. And I am not just talking about 3 minutes on television at midnight. I think there is got to be a very fair presentation of the opposition case. So, I do not want to sound insensitive to what is happened, to the burden on Honduras. I am sensitive to it and am perfectly prepared to discuss it further with President Azcona. We discussed it when he was up here. But we are getting close now in terms of time, and these elections are the key to a lot of things. Thank you, ENTITY. There have been reports of the United States concentrating troops along the Mexican border for drug interdiction matters. A, can you confirm that for us? And, B, given the nature of our border and the fact that Mexico uses a substantial part of its own army for the same purposes, would you like to see an operation on the border constrained to the border of Mexico and the United States designed to break up drug traffic and arms traffic coming from the United States into Mexico? I'd like to see the utmost cooperation between the military. I am not sure that I am prepared to endorse a joint force, and I am not sure Mexico President Salinas would want that. But I should tell you, we have reached a new level of cooperation because of the courage of the new President of Mexico. And in terms of our interdiction, what you may be thinking of is not a deployment of U.S. troops but using the National Guard in some areas on exercises to try to stop drugs from coming in. The more cooperation we have with Mexico along the lines you are talking about to interdict whether it is illegal arms going one way or illegal drugs coming another to have that border policed and peaceful, the better it is. But I am very encouraged by the cooperation we are getting all up and down the line from the Salinas administration, and I hope they are encouraged, because this is indeed a two-way street. And as one who feels very close to Mexico as you know, my grandchildren are half-Mexican, and this one is one that is real close to my heart. And I do not want to propose anything nor will I support anything that looks like an abuse of U.S. power. The way to do it is to work cooperatively with the Salinas regime and the officials in the military, policia, whatever it is, to accomplish the ends that both countries want. So, we will try. And I am not suggesting we do not have border problems. We do; Mexico does with us. But the level of cooperation has really stepped up. And our visit with the President here I think the more my high officials my Cabinet people that saw him, the more impressed they were. ENTITY, in Peru we have two extremely serious problems: the economic crisis and the terrorist subversion. They limit and complicate any effective action which may be taken with regard to the drug traffic. In this respect, what will be the principal proposal of cooperation of your government in our joint battle against the drug scourge? Well, we have made some proposals on antinarcotics that affect Peru and affect Bolivia. But I think the way to answer that question is to say I enthusiastically look forward to participation in this so-called Andean drug summit, and we are going to be trying to set the along with as invitees and invitors. We said earlier we thought this was a good idea. Now we have had official invitation from Bolivia and Colombia and Peru. And I think to really definitively answer your question we have got to have that meeting, because I do not want them to be making proposals that just go counter to the culture in Peru. And I want them to understand, though, how strongly we feel about it and how prepared we are to help them. So, we have made some proposals, and as you know, we have helped in the past, principally in Bolivia on helicopters and spraying. But I do not want to go further than that now until we have this summit. There is no point in having it if we have our minds already made up. I have got to hear from them. We have got to have a hemispheric answer, not just a U.S. proposal on it. ENTITY, ex-Secretary Schlesinger, writing in the Washington Post this morning, pointed to the increasing consumption of oil by the U.S. and the increasing dependency, as a result, on the Gulf region. Now, I know that, as a former oilman, you must be aware of the very large reserves in the hemisphere of heavy oil. What would be your ideas regarding the possibility of a hemispheric preference arrangement to decrease your dependency on the Gulf? I would be very wary of interjecting myself, our government, into the market. I'd be concerned about that. I can see the security argument that some might make, and it is valid. You have Mexico; you have the enormous resources in Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela; Colombia has some production. And you can make a case that there is more for the security interest of the United States in giving preference. My problem with it is it distorts the market, and it artificially could raise the price to the American consumer, or you could start regional conflict not military but economic conflict between the producing countries. And Saudi Arabia and, to some degree, Kuwait and Iran dominate the international oil market. And if we move to preferences, if we move to regional compacts of this nature, I think you could set off a price war that would damage the economy not just of the of every producing country. And that would work opposite of increasing prices here, but it would not be good for the economies that need to optimize their revenue from oil and gas. And I am talking about Mexico, and I am certainly talking about Venezuela. But I share Jim's I did not see this article, but I share his concern about my country becoming ever increasing on foreign sources. And that is why I have tasked Jim Watkins, our able Secretary of Energy, to come up with a national energy policy. And it will not just be hydrocarbons: It will be more use of domestic of gas, I am sure. It will be a vital industry in oil, but it will be alternate sources as well. We are not going to back away from nuclear power in this country. ENTITY, in Peru and my country, Bolivia, there are thousands of people working in the coca leaf fields because they do not have any other source of income. Unless there is a serious commitment from rich countries to help to create jobs through investments, for instance the narco traffic problem probably will not change. ENTITY, do you think that the United States Government would consider the possibility to initiate and encourage investments in those countries to try to change the entire situation for every Julio , we certainly consider that. Again, that is a subject that I want to discuss with your new and, I'd say, very impressive President. Again, I had a good meeting with him. And I do not want to prejudge this so-called Andean drug summit, but we recognize that many of these small peasant farmers are dependent on coca crops. I also recognize that the business has gotten pretty good for them better than it used to be because more people, especially in my country, are using the damn stuff. So, we do not want to do I am not sure it is just supply and demand that is working there. But we have got to be openminded about alternative cropping. We have certainly got to be openminded about trying to get business opportunities that would take some of these farmers and get them involved in something other than producing coca. So, I am openminded, but again, I do not want to prejudge the summit. ENTITY, as you know, we will have Presidential elections in Brazil in 3 weeks. And the U.S.-Brazil relations have become a major issue in the political campaign. What I would like to know is your expectations regarding this election and what the new President, that will be elected by the people for the first time in almost 30 years, could expect from the U.S.? Let me answer your question, but let me ask for clarification. How has the U.S. become an issue in the election? Just so I can respond. These recent trade disputes and environment and so on. Okay. Well, first, this is an enormous country. And the heartbeat is democracy, I am convinced of that; that has not always been the history. I think that is the heartbeat in Brazil. So, the United States should stand ready, as we have with Argentina, to see what comes out of the election clearly, not be involved in the election and then stand ready with a friendly country and I think we do have friendly relations with Brazil to iron out what has cropped up as difficulties, be it in trade or something else. And so, I would just say: Look, you have got a new regime. What do you stand for? What kind of relations do you want with the United States? And we are ready we are ready to deal with you. And Brazil faces horrendous debt problems, too. One area that is been a little contentious has to do with the forests and with the environmental implications of that on global warming. And at first, I think there was a disconnect between Brazil and the United States, but now I do not think we are very far apart. We had a good talk with President Sarney in New York about this. And I think when we were talking about environmental set-asides he thought I was talking about intervention into the sovereignty or diminishing the sovereignty of Brazil. And heaven's sakes, we are not interested in that. We are interested in this concept of global warming and in working with Brazil in a constructive way. So, I think we have ironed out what might have been major misunderstandings. Without knowing who wins the election and what that person stands for, I'd have to wait and see. I would simply go back to Argentina, when some were predicting, I think we would all recognize, great difficulties if President Menem won the election. We had a lot of sophisticated guys telling me, hey, this would be not good for me, for the United States, for our country. It turns out to be just the opposite. So, we cannot prejudge. We have all been through campaigns; we have listened to campaign rhetoric espoused a little myself from time to time. But look at the facts; look at where we are going. And we want to do that with Brazil, and we will. ENTITY, the drug fighting it is a matter of survival in Colombia and a way to defend our democracy. The Colombian Government established a reward of 100 million pesos to the person that provides any information in order to catch the big drug traffickers. However, they move to other countries, and the action has not been effective yet. We feel like if they are caught the drug problem is going to fall down a lot. Has the United States Government, through any international organization, considered the possibility of setting up a better and more attractive reward? I had not thought about the reward possibility. Maybe our Department of Justice has. So, I should hedge a little bit on that. What we have done is set up or are in the process of setting up much more cooperation with others in terms of the problem itself. In the first place, we have, I want to repeat, a great respect for what President Barco is doing against a lot of tough forces and against good God, here you guys are in the newspaper business, and just for printing the truth and standing up against this, you have been firebombed and had great difficulty. So, we can identify with that. So, I think it is going to be everyone knows our stance on extradition, and I understand it is not a particularly popular stance in some areas in Colombia. But the administration, President Barco, has been very good about that. Whether the reward I know we have some rewards, but whether it applies to this or not, I'd have to get you an answer. Marlin, if you would I am embarrassed to say I do not know the specific figures. And there is not , on my desk, a proposal to increase the rewards. If there was some feeling on the part of President Barco, on other leaders in the hemisphere, that this would be useful, I can guarantee you I would give it fast consideration, because we have got to show that we are doing what we can against consumption your point and that we want to cooperate in every way possible to bring these people to justice. ENTITY, the drug cartel has sent various messages to the Colombian Government and to the Colombian Congress seeking some sort of dialog to end the war. In their last message 2 days ago, they even proposed that this subject should be put to a referendum. They have specifically offered to dismantle all their operations, to retire completely from the business, and to eliminate drug trafficking from Colombia. What would be your reaction if the Colombian Government would eventually agree to this dialog? I would let the Colombians make their determination on how they want to treat problems in their own country. But I would be very wary of taking the word of an indicted drug dealer. I would be extraordinarily worried about that because I do not think they keep their word. I think these are people that the background on some of them, you know well, were common criminals until they got into the lucrative business of poisoning the kids not just in the United States but in Colombia as well and every other country as well. So, I am not sure the Colombian officials need free advice from me, but I would be very wary about that negotiation. And I think that the Government of Colombia has been very wary about that kind of negotiation because they know the kind of people they are dealing with. ENTITY, Colombia's war on drugs can only be sustained if the country's economy is strengthened. Eighty-seven million dollars, which was given to our country basically in military equipment, is a welcome aid. We were very grateful for your help. But we feel that in order to maintain the proper political attitude of the Colombian people towards drugs much more for the country's economy is needed. Could you consider and perhaps the meeting at the Andean summit might be the place to give, eventually, discussion to this would you be able to consider a type of Marshall plan for countries such as Colombia that are decidedly and deeply involved in the war on drugs? Well, again, I would be willing to consider anything. And I hate to cry poor mouth we are living under constraints on the economic side that I wish we were not living under. But we did discuss with the President of Colombia the egregious effect that the coffee agreement has had on the overall economy and, thus, the resources available to help fight narcotics. So, we told him, look, we are going to try to help reinstate this agreement. It is not a popular thing in this country because people think, hey, I am going to have to pay more for a cup of coffee; but we ought to go the extra mile here in trying to help Colombia. And so, it is with that in mind on that one facet of the problem I think we can try to help. But, look, if there is some bold plan that can come out of this summit that will help in the areas that produce it and then Colombia, which has both production and has become this factory, really, for these people we should be openminded about it and go the extra mile to try to help on the economic because I do see the connection. We do not just say, look, you do something about these drugs crime, criminals, explosions, arms and then forget the economy. We are not going to do that. But I have got to stop a little short until I know what the view of these leaders will be when we get there. The celebration of the 100 years of Costa Rican democracy will make you coincide in our country with Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega. I have thought about that. Is there a possibility that you will be meeting or would you be willing to meet President Ortega in Costa Rica, and what topics would you be willing to discuss with him? No. We are there as guests of President Arias. And there is no meeting planned. Certainly there will be interaction. This is a multilateral approach, coming there to salute democracy. I find it somewhat ironic that Mr. Ortega is there to salute democracy, but nevertheless, so be it; that is good. We want to have a tribute to 100 years of Costa Rican democracy, and what we do not want to do is inject a lot of regional tensions into their meeting. But I am going to be polite, charming and if I had an encounter, it would be very firm because I do not see why that one Sandinista regime is swimming against the tide, as Chairman Mao used to say. Why not? The aspirations in our hemisphere, in all these countries, is for democracy; and you see it happening all the time just heard about it around this table by your very questions. And Marx's star is fading not just in this hemisphere but look at Eastern Europe, look around the whole world and human rights are rising up, and pluralism is coming on. So, let the Nicaraguan people speak to this question. They do not need George Bush telling them how to do it. Let them speak to it and be sure that the opposition has every opportunity to take their case to the people of Nicaragua. But it is not going to help to have me go through this once again with Mr. Ortega. I had a chance to do that in Brazil. He knows how I feel about it, and everybody knows we have a tense relationship. So, I do not want to act like we are waltzing around there in great harmony, because we are not. And there are so many ways that they can prove that they want to join the family of nations in this hemisphere stay with it, and stop subverting El Salvador in the process would be a good way to begin. We stopped a major shipment of arms interdicted the other day going into El Salvador. So, I have no agenda with Mr. Ortega. And as he takes a step that might lead to democracy, great, I am for that; but we are not going to solve any problems there in Costa Rica. I am there as the guest of the country, guest of President Arias. I wish Mr. Ortega had been there when Arias was sworn in, and I will tell you why. I realize that the United States has varying degrees of problems in our own hemisphere for a lot of historic reasons. Maybe you were there this day I am talking about. I represented the United States as Vice President. You had 30,000 people in a stadium in the capital. Remember that day? The national stadium. The national stadium, exactly. And what you did was to go in there, everybody lined up behind their flag. And I am saying to myself, I do not know what kind of reception I am going to get the U.S. Stars and Stripes and the Vice President I know we have got good relations with Costa Rica, but a lot of other countries represented. I swear to God, to the day I die I will never forget the reception for my country. It was not me they did not know who the hell I was but marching in behind the Stars and Stripes with our little delegation, and people were cheering, and it was democracy. It overlooked any kind of regional differences, and it was so moving and touching. And when the Nicaraguan representative walked in there, they were whistling and giving it the old cheer that you give when some guy gives you a bad call in a soccer game. And it said something. I am standing, listening very carefully to this what are the people trying to say? and it is not we love you, North Americanos or anything like this. It was democracy. And it made a profound impression on me. And I do not think there is going to be an occasion for that kind of thing. But if Mr. Ortega had been there instead of his representative, Vice President Ramirez, he would have heard this, and he would have sensed it. He would have understood what the Costa Ricans were talking about when they had this peaceful transition yet again the will of the people being exercised. Sorry to end with a lecture, but it is a good ending point because we are not going down there to have some battle with Mr. Ortega. I am not uptight about his being there. But I am there to celebrate the Costa Rican democracy, 100 years of it, and to join other democratically elected Presidents in saluting the democracy of this country and recognizing that it has not been easy for Argentina or Brazil or some countries to come out of a different kind of a past, even though the people probably never lost their confidence in democracy. Chile is a good example. And so, that is what we are going there for. And I just hope that it does not get cluttered up by the photographers that work for you guys wanting to see a picture of me and Ortega together. That has nothing to do with democracy in Costa Rica nothing. ENTITY, on Mr. Noriega we each asked our question. Will you answer one question on Noriega? Yes, be delighted to. He is not my favorite character, but what is it? You have been criticized in this country politically and some of the media for the way you reacted in the coup in Panama. Yes. You said that you acted according to what you felt. I was not criticized by any of the Presidents of the countries around this table, I noticed not one. Right. But some of the media in this country and some in Congress We have got a lot of hawks out here; we have got a lot of macho guys out there that want me to send somebody else's kid into battle. And what I will do is prudently assess the situation at the time, and I have seen nothing in terms of intelligence or fact coming in later that would make me have done something differently. And that does not mean that under some provocation or some denial of our rights as the United States of America, that I'd be afraid to use force. But for these instant hawks up there to those doves that now become instant hawks on Capitol Hill, they do not bother me one bit because the American people supported me by over 2 to 1, and I think I sent a strong signal to the countries represented around this table that we are not going to imprudently use the force of the United States. If somebody lays a glove on an American citizen there in the Canal Zone or where we have certain treaty rights, then we have got a different story. Will you participate in the next uprising? And this man must be brought to justice. This man is an indicted drug dealer. And I have not changed. You know, one of the hits they gave me is I said that we have no argument with the Panamanian Defense Forces. We do not . And some of our more sophisticated columnists, perhaps who you are referring to, say the minute the President says this, this implies that he is going to use U.S. force. Ridiculous. I am not going to do that. But it does not imply I am not going to use force. Look at the situation. So, I am not going to say what I am going to do force or no force but there is no implicit guarantee that when some guy jumps up and causes a coup, that the United States is going to send in the SOUTHCOM forces. So, we took a few hits on it, but not too much. I think it is come out reasonably well. But when I had the Prime Minister of Spain here the other day, he understood it. And it is very important to me, I think, as it relates to this hemisphere that we all love so much, too. But this man has to go. And I will tell you what: The minute Noriega gets out of there, the minute he is gone unless replaced by a tyrant, so I reserve that but the minute he is gone, we have instantly improved relations with Panama. We have good relations with the people of Panama. And I will be darned if we should sit here, as countries that respect democracy, and let this man beat up the Vice President, Guillermo Ford, beat the hell out of him and bleed him out there, to avert democracy. We are talking about the trend for democracy, and Panama is entitled to it. And it cannot be superimposed by the United States, but they spoke in a free and fair election, and they are entitled to it. And I am going to do everything I can from up here. I am working with our colleagues in the hemisphere, Venezuelan President and others, to try to see that the will of the people is respected. And Noriega is the fly in the ointment. Many of those Panamanian Defense Force officers were trained in the United States. They are not hostile to us, and we darn sure are not hostile to them, but we are hostile to a man who aborts democracy and gets tied up in this international narcotics business. Will you accept a man named by Noriega as head of the Panama Canal Company, sir? What is his name? If he is named by Noriega Will you support that will give the poor guy if he is supported He is already named him. I do not know his name. Well, I do not know who it is, either, but I will tell you, he does not have much chance of getting through the Senate. In our system, you have got to go up to the Hill to get something confirmed. And if he goes up under the mantle of Mr. Noriega, he'd get two chances slim and none. Those are the chances. Will you support it, ENTITY the next uprising? Will you support it? I cannot say that. How do I know what it is? I want to see Noriega out, democracy in. And I would give support to something like that. But you cannot give a carte blanche; you have got to know what the facts are. And that is why I did what I did in this last thing or did not do what some would have me do. The facts were quite different than some of the perceptions.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlatinamericanjournalists", "title": "Interview With Latin American Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-latin-american-journalists", "publication_date": "25-10-1989", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 415, "text": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. I will go straight to questions as I have no announcements. Thanks, ENTITY. I am sure you saw just a few minutes ago that the Senate voted for the filibuster on gun legislation. Any reaction to that? Well, as you saw on the President's statement yesterday and as you have seen all week from the President and the rest of us, we have been encouraged by bipartisan progress on this very important package of proposals. There is still work to be done. This was simply -- while very important -- a first stage in an effort to get sensible, common-sense legislation that would reduce gun violence in America while protecting Americans' Second Amendment rights signed into law. But we certainly welcome this development. And now that everybody has their cards out on the table in terms of the budget, is there going to be -- do you think that there will be some kind of push for negotiations in the short term on a grand bargain? Or will this kind of linger until this summer when we have to raise the debt ceiling again? Well, the President is interested in reaching a bipartisan compromise built around the principles that are clear in his budget proposal as soon as possible. There is regular order at work now. The House has passed a budget. The Senate has passed a budget. The President has presented a budget. And there is an opportunity to move forward and find common ground. The President has been engaged in a process of having conversations with lawmakers of both parties; in this case, reaching out directly to Republican lawmakers to find out if they are open to the general principle that we should approach our deficit challenges in a balanced way so that we can protect seniors, secure the middle class, allow our economy to grow, and reduce the deficit in a responsible way. That is the President's approach that is embodied in the budget that he presented yesterday. So whose court is the ball in now? Is it incumbent upon Republicans to -- he said in the Rose Garden yesterday that he wants to see Republicans in the coming days show that they are serious about deficit reduction. So do they have to take some action now to get things going? I would refer you to what the President said. We believe that the President's budget proposal, which incorporates the offer that he made to Speaker Boehner at the end of the year -- which by any definition represents a good faith effort that meets the Republicans at least halfway -- that therefore the Republicans ought to examine that and let the American people know whether or not they are too interested in finding common ground rather than embracing ideological purity. I mean, there is only one way to do this in a responsible way that protects the middle class, protects seniors, that makes the necessary investments in our economy that will allow it to grow now and in the future, and that is represented by the President's budget -- a budget that I think you have seen in commentary has been recognized as a compromise proposition. It is not his ideal budget. It is not a wish list. It is an attempt to find common ground so that we can deal with our fiscal challenges on behalf of the whole country and move forward. And the immigration Gang of Eight has agreed that before anybody that is here illegally can be on a path to a green card, that we need to have 100 percent surveillance of our border in Mexico, and I think it is 90 percent apprehension rate, which seems like a pretty high bar to meet. Is that requirement in line with the President's vision for what a real path to citizenship is? Well, the President believes, as he made clear in his blueprint that has been available publicly for a long time now, that there has to be a clear pathway to citizenship available; that comprehensive immigration reform must include both that and must continue the focus that he is placed on border security. I would note that there are a variety of ways to measure improvements and progress when it comes to security. And we can point you to a number of facts, which are that apprehensions are down by nearly 80 percent since 2000 and down 50 percent since 2008. And, at the same time, we have increased boots on the ground along the border to more than 21,000 personnel. That is more than at any time in our history. This is progress that has been broadly recognized by Democrats and Republicans, and demonstrates the President's commitment to border security. When it comes to the actual legislation, we wait for that legislation to be produced, and we will assess it when it is. We absolutely commend the progress that has been made, but the President remains committed to the proposition that the result has to be a bill that can earn bipartisan support as well as his signature. And we hope that process moves forward. ENTITY, you saw the reaction yesterday, probably from many reporters, on the chained CPI inclusion in the budget. Even one Republican congressman called it an attack on seniors. Is there any concern at the White House that this is something that will make it -- that Republicans will use to avoid the grand bargain and even to hurt Democrats politically? The President's budget represents a compromise. The inclusion of entitlement reform, specifically chained CPI and means testing of Medicare, comes at the specific behest and request of Republican leaders, as you know. Back in December of 2012, Speaker of the House Boehner said that he wants to use a new method of calculating benefits for entitlement programs known as chained CPI. Again, a Republican congressionalist is citing another news source, Bloomberg. A Republican congressional aide said that Boehner is pressing harder for the CPI revision than for other entitlement changes. Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader -- this is quoting the Wall Street Journal -- said bipartisan agreement on higher Medicare premiums for the wealthy and increase in the Medicare eligibility age, and slowing cost-of-living increases for Social Security could move both parties closer to a budget deal. And by that, a budget deal he meant and everyone meant in December of last year, a budget deal that would be balanced and include revenues, which obviously was part of the President's approach. Mitch McConnell said again that chained CPI was something that he wanted as part of a broader deal. So this is a Republican proposal. And cynical attempts to make it otherwise by some represent I think dissonance within the Republican Party, and we have seen plenty of condemnation from conservatives and Republicans of that sort of flagrantly ridiculous and cynical attempt to disown a proposal that emanated from Republican leaders. It is the responsible thing to do to try to find common ground. To find common ground you need to meet the other side halfway. You need to accept you are not going to get everything you want. You need to accept things that the other side wants. The three proposals I mentioned that Republican leaders said they wanted as part of a bipartisan deal that would include revenue as well as entitlement reforms -- of those three, the President has included two in his budget. By definition, two out of three is more than halfway. So the President expects and hopes that members of the common-sense caucus will recognize the common-sense nature of his proposal, how it demonstrates as a seriousness of purpose that should infuse everyone's efforts here in Washington when it comes to addressing our budget challenges, and that we can move forward. This is the spirit in which the President had dinner with a dozen Republican senators last night, the second such dinner in recent weeks. And it is the spirit in which he will approach his conversations with Republicans going forward. Let me throw two other quick issues at you. Why is the President meeting with CEOs from the banking industry today? And what is the purpose of their meeting? Well, there is a meeting, a roundtable, that is being held with other members of the administration, and that is part of our ongoing engagement with the financial sector and with the business community. This is a regular occurrence. As you know, we engage with the business community all the time. Any particular agenda, though, for that meeting? I would have to take the question. Not that I am aware of. All right, and last quick issue. The President met yesterday with the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who today expressed their opposition to the forced feeding of hunger strike inmates in Guantanamo. What reaction did the President give to that opposition in their meeting yesterday? First of all, what I can tell you is that you know our commitment to close Gitmo. It is a commitment shared by the former President, by military leaders, and other Republicans, including Senator McCain. And we continue to be committed to closing that facility in our national security interests. I do not have any specific response to what is happening now, except to say that the President remains committed to closing Gitmo for national security reasons. But is he aware of this hunger strike? Is he following it? The President obviously is updated on a number of issues. I have not had a specific conversation with him about this. In the 2008 campaign, the President, then-candidate Obama, issued a statement saying, I will not touch Social Security. So a number of Democrats are now accusing the President of breaking his word. They feel betrayed. You just said it was a Republican proposal, so why is a Democratic President issuing a Republican budget? Because he is President of the whole country, and he believes we need to reach a budget compromise that is balanced, that allows the economy to grow, that secures a rising and thriving middle class, and invests in the economy of the future while reducing our deficits in a responsible way. His budget is proof that you can do that; that you do not need to take the path embodied by the House Republican budget, which would dramatically slice investments in education; would block grant Medicaid, cut it dramatically, harming families who have children with disabilities; would voucherize Medicare, shifting costs onto seniors at an average of thousands of dollars per year, all the while giving a massive tax break to wealthy individuals and the most well-connected. But is it getting the nation anywhere closer to a deal? Well, he believes he is because it represents compromise and an attempt to find common ground. It is incumbent upon Republicans to do the same -- to, in the spirit of compromise and a desire for progress, to meet the President halfway and to accept that they will not get what they want, that the document they passed in the House is maybe satisfying in an ideological way, but it is not in any way representative of either what the American people broadly support or what could ever become law here in Washington, and that instead, they ought to embrace the idea of balance. It is not the President's ideal approach. There is no -- But is this who he really is, and progressives are misunderstanding what he truly believes in? The President believes that it is in the overall interest of the nation's economy and middle class that we reach a budget deal of the kind the he presented yesterday. And the reason that is, is because we need to continue to grow the economy and create jobs. That is the best thing we can do for middle-class families and for the people he fights for every day. In order to achieve that deal, he recognizes he will have to make some tough choices and that Democrats will have to accept things that they would not otherwise want to do; but so, too, will Republicans. Republicans who suggest that the only way to move forward in deficit reduction is to put the burden entirely on seniors and the middle class are wrong, and it will not be accepted and it is not an approach that this President will accept. And it is an approach that, by the way, was the center of debate for an entire year in a presidential election and the American people roundly rejected it. So it is not his ideal budget. He has accepted as part of his offer to the Speaker of the House, which is included in his budget proposal, a compromise position and entitlement reforms that he can accept as part of a broader deal that asks everybody to participate in the effort and that invests in our economy, and secures and enhances the middle class. Thank you, ENTITY. The cloture was invoked with a pretty strong margin. Does the President have any sense of whether the voices from Newtown, whether public attitudes really did make any impact on the Senate? Did he raise it with the senators last night? And is it premature to think that the NRA's voice in Congress is not as strong as it used to be? I would say a couple of things. The President has no doubt whatsoever that the voices of the Newtown families and the voices of Americans across the country that were raised this week as part of an effort to urge the Senate to move forward, and not block procedurally the progress on this legislation, had a positive effect and may well have been decisive. The President has said all along, and you heard him in Hartford on Monday, that Congress will do the right thing if the American people speak up, if they raise their voices, if they make their views known. And as he said then, it is not about him; it is about the American people and what the right, common-sense thing is to do when it comes to taking action to reduce gun violence. On the second part, as I said to Josh, this is an important milestone, but it is an early milestone. And there is no question that challenges will continue to be placed in the way of making progress on passing common-sense legislation that would reduce gun violence. But we are obviously very pleased with today's vote. Does the President have real concerns about the assault weapons ban, the size of ammunition clips, as being things that will not be able to move forward? The President believes that those are common-sense proposals. Reinstatement of the assault weapons ban makes eminent sense. Making sure that military-style assault weapons are not available on the streets of the United States is a common-sense approach. It does not infringe upon Americans' Second Amendment rights. Limiting the size of ammunition clips will save lives, and it is not an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of the American people. The President strongly supports Second Amendment rights. So he insists -- as the American people insist, as the families of the victims of Newtown and Tucson and Aurora and Oak Creek and Virginia Tech, and so many other places across the country insist -- that the United States Senate on each of these holds itself to account, that senators vote on these aspects of the legislation, that they do not filibuster or use other procedural measures to avoid being held to account. And if they have to vote no, they should vote no and explain why, rather than hide behind procedure and other parliamentary tricks to obscure what is really happening. On the question that Josh asked about immigration, do you want to state a position on this apparent agreement the Gang of Eight has come up on border security? Well, there is an apparent agreement that -- I mean, if you have the bill to show me, I'd be interested to take it with me and bring it back here. But we will await legislation and we will evaluate it when it emerges. We are encouraged by the process. The President's commitment to border security is evident not just in his blueprint, which makes clear that border security -- So you do not want to weigh in one way or the other, whether they should include it or not? Again, border security absolutely must be part of comprehensive immigration. But I mean, this particular metric. If you have legislation that demonstrates what is in it, I'd be interested in seeing it. My understanding is that legislation has not been produced. They are still working on it. When it emerges, we will evaluate it. What is a take-away from the dinner last night? A different group of senators -- do you think this is something that is gaining momentum? The President feels like it is a worthwhile exercise and it is not just a sort of for-show thing? Well, it is certainly not for show in the President's mind. The President believes that both dinners and all of his engagements with Republicans have been constructive and useful. He is very much of the mind that exploring the possibility of finding common ground is in the interest of the American people and the American economy, and it is in the interest of trying to find bipartisan solutions to a whole range of issues, not just our budget and fiscal challenges -- but immigration reform, reducing gun violence, taking steps to enhance America's energy independence and security, making sure that we continue to invest in education and research and development. So there are a variety of arenas here where the possibility of bipartisan compromise exists. In spite of the polarization that does pertain here in Washington, it is also the case that whether it is on gun violence and the vote that we have talked about that happened today, or on immigration reform, or within the context of at least the discussions that the President has been having, there is at least evidence of the potential for bipartisan cooperation. And the President believes that is important. Did either one of the dinners in of themselves propel what we saw on the Senate floor today on gun control or the progress being made on immigration? I would not presume, on the President's behalf, to suggest that any single meal he had with lawmakers led to a specific result. The work that is been done on reducing gun violence in the Senate is to the credit of those who have been engaged in that work on Capitol Hill. We have obviously been engaged with them in that work. The same holds for progress being made on immigration reform. As the President made clear when he talked about it from the beginning after the election, he wanted to see progress emerge from the Senate through the Gang of Eight process because he believed that would produce the best opportunity for bipartisan legislation that reflected his principles and that he could sign. And that progress is being made. So the credit is widespread, but we should not be assigning credit yet. We are not at the finish line in any of these areas yet. We need to keep pressing so that Congress keeps moving and hopefully produces legislation that the American people will support, that Congress will vote for, and that the President can sign. I want to talk to you about North Korea before I let you go. Has it been the President's intention -- because we have not heard him speak to this issue directly for some weeks -- to not, by staying out of public eye and staying out of this in an audible sense, avoid anything that can be either misinterpreted or just not engaged to suggest to the North Koreans that he is rising to their level? I mean, even analysts who are very accustomed to this cycle of provocation and rhetoric do feel that this looks, sounds, and appears different than other cases. And the average American, they are hearing a lot of things that may unnerve them, and yet they have not heard from the President of the United States. Is he intentionally staying out of this for some strategic communication reason? The President has been directing his national security team to take necessary precautionary measures that will ensure that we can both defend ourself and our allies -- defend ourselves and our allies, defend the homeland. And I think that represents the fact that he is concerned about the stepped-up rhetoric and the provocative behavior by the North Korean regime. It is also the case that what we have seen of late from Pyongyang represents a familiar pattern of behavior. And as you refer to it as cycles, and I think that is an appropriate way to describe it, we have seen this kind of cycle in the past. It is always unhelpful. It is always destabilizing, and it is never in the interest of the North Korean people. It only serves to further isolate North Korea and to undermine any hope the North Korean regime has of reentering the community of nations and assuring the international community that it intends to abide by the obligations that it has made. So we are taking necessary steps -- But is it in the interest of the President not to talk about it and talk to the country about it? I think the President has made clear through the actions of his administration and this government, through the variety of means that have been reported on and the steps that we have taken, the seriousness with which we take this. It is also important to note, as I said, that we have seen a pattern of -- this is reflective of a pattern of behavior that has been going on for quite some time from North Korea. Is this a top issue with Ban Ki-moon later on today? I believe there will be a number of issues discussed with the United Nations Secretary General. This is certainly one of them. It is an issue that the Security Council took up not very long ago, passing a resolution condemning North Korean behavior and sanctioning North Korea that was unanimous, that included affirmative votes from both the Russians and the Chinese. And we are working with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, as well as with Moscow and Beijing to try to bring about a change in behavior from the North Koreans, asking especially the Russians and the Chinese to use the influence they have, the unique influence they have with the North Koreans to prevail upon Pyongyang to ratchet down the rhetoric and the behavior, because it is in the interest of every nation in the region that there be stability in the region, and that there ultimately be a Korean Peninsula that is denuclearized. Following on the Ban Ki-moon meeting -- Sure. On another topic, Syria, which obviously is likely to come up -- been a lot of reports the last couple days suggesting that the U.S. is increasing its aid to the rebels. And obviously, there is an important distinction about nonlethal aid, lethal aid. Can you be direct with us about how significant you see this increase in aid? And what does it mean? I appreciate the question. The President himself has said that we are constantly reviewing possible options that could help end the violence and accelerate a political transition in Syria. We have provided more than $115 million in nonlethal assistance to the Syrian opposition thus far and have been steadily increasing that assistance to help the opposition become stronger, more cohesive, and more organized. And as Secretary Kerry announced in Rome, soon we will be providing food rations and medical kits to both the coalition and to the opposition's supreme military council in order to feed the hungry and tend to the sick and wounded. The President has directed his national security team to identify additional measures to continue increasing nonlethal assistance to assist the operation -- the opposition, rather. So I think that addresses your question. The President -- we have continued to ratchet up. We are on an upward trajectory with our assistance, both humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and direct assistance --nonlethal assistance -- to the Syrian opposition. And we will continue to step up that assistance. The President has directed his team to identify additional measures that we can take to increase that assistance, and we will have a decision to announce in the future. I do not have an announcement to make today. Quick related question on that. DNI Clapper was on the Hill today, and in some important testimony he said directly that if Assad falls, he said, it is a tough call whether or not the chemical weapons stockpile can be secured. How worried are you about that? It sounds like a pretty dramatic statement from the DNI. Well, there is no question, as we have stated all along, that the disposition of chemical weapons in Syria is a matter of concern to the United States and our allies and partners -- a matter of great concern obviously to countries in the region. And we have made clear, as the President did I believe from this podium, that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons is a red line as far as he is concerned when it comes to the Syrian regime. I would point you to what Director Clapper said. I will not engage in hypotheticals about the welcomed day when Assad is finally -- or when Syria is finally rid of Assad and what will happen. But you can be sure that the disposition of those weapons will be a matter of focus and concern for this nation, as well as many others. Two other quick topics. ACLU has released some documents that they obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request with the IRS, where IRS agents claim they can go through people's emails and text messages without a warrant. Is the White House concerned about the IRA making that claim in terms of people's privacy? I would have to take the question. I am not aware of the story or the documents that were obtained, and I would certainly refer you to the IRS as a starting point. Last thing -- and this may be in the same boat on. There is a German family, came to America in 2008 seeking asylum because they did not like German public schools. The reason why it relates to the White House is they got asylum, it was then overturned, and there is a chance they are going to be deported. And there is a petition at whitehouse.gov, an online petition, and it is gotten over 100,000 signatures saying they want the President to intervene so that this family does not have to go back to Germany. They think the public schools -- they have been home-schooling their kids here in America, and they do not like the German public schools. It is reached over 100,000 signatures. What is the process for reacting to something like that? And are you aware of this specific case? I am not aware of it. I will certainly take the question. We do have a threshold beyond which we respond to We the People= petitions, and if that threshold is crossed, I am sure we will respond. But I do not have a specific comment on this case. ENTITY, thanks. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said of North Korea that it is skating very close to a dangerous line. Does the President share that assessment? And has he identified a red line, a line by which North Korea crossing that would be unacceptable? Well, I will not engage in hypotheticals about what red lines there are. It is unacceptable to flagrantly violate your international commitments, as North Korea continues to do. And the result of that behavior has been increasing international consensus around the proposition that North Korea's flagrant violations of its obligations must stop. That has resulted in increased isolation and sanctions. It has resulted in all the range of actions that we have taken in response to the recent series of provocative acts and statements. There is no question that North Korea -- because of its development of a nuclear weapon, because of its violation of its commitments, its development of missile technology -- represents a danger and a threat. And that is why we address it the way that we do. So I think that the words of Secretary Hagel are reflective of the administration's view of this problem. It is why we have taken the actions that we have taken to ensure that we can enhance both the security of both the homeland and our allies. And we will continue to take necessary, prudent measures as the situation demands. Well, I guess getting at it from a different angle, the President has identified a clear red line when it comes to Syria, for example. So why not lay down a similar marker in this instance, given the provocations? I am not sure what you are asking, because the President identified a clear red line about chemical weapons -- the use of or proliferation of the chemical weapons that the Syrian regime possesses. North Korea is already in flagrant violation of its international obligations. It is engaged in the development of nuclear weapons. It is engaged in development of missile technology that is in contradiction to its commitments. And that is why you see the international response that you have seen. And we will continue to work with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon North Korea to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to North Korea. There is an opportunity for North Korea to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for North Korea, and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that North Korea takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. It is not a starting point. It is a sticking point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with Republicans. The American people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The American people expect their leaders in Washington to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for America's children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future. The President's budget is a common-sense document that represents a sincere attempt to compromise with Republicans on behalf of the whole country. The fact is it is not an la carte menu, as I think Gene Sperling said yesterday in our briefing. When the Republican leadership said during fiscal cliff negotiations that when it came to entitlement reforms, that they wanted the President to go along with chained CPI and means testing of Medicare as part of an agreement that would include revenues, the as part of part is very important. That is what the President believes. It has to be not just revenues on the one hand and entitlement reforms on the other, but the whole approach has to be embraced -- a balanced approach that allows for investments so that our economy can grow, that allows for the kind of security for the middle class and seniors that is so essential. And it allows for the guarantee that those programs represent to our seniors to continue into the future. So the Republicans have to decide -- and there are rank-and-file Republicans who believe this already, but Republicans including leadership has to decide whether they want to find compromise or they would rather stick to positions that are at odds with where most of America is, and are certainly at odds with where the President is. Is the President confident he can get his own party on board with this, given the backlash? Does he need to start having dinner with them? The President is confident that -- as he was during the fiscal cliff negotiations, as he was in previous negotiations with the Speaker of the House -- that Democrats will support a bipartisan compromise that ensures that our assistance programs to our seniors are safeguarded, and that that guarantee is provided; that ensure that investments in education are made, and investments in innovation and research and development and infrastructure are made. So the answer is yes. The budget represents tough choices, there is no question. But it also expects from the other side that they make tough choices. Back to the CEO meeting this morning -- I know ENTITY had asked a question -- but I was wondering, did the President plan to bring up unemployment with the executives, and did he talk up his budget a bit with them? Do you know? I was not in the meeting. I do not have a readout of it. We have a strategy of engagement with the business sector that is ongoing and this is part of that strategy. I certainly would not be surprised if some of these matters came up. The need to deal with growing the economy and creating jobs is his number-one priority. So I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is something that he would want to talk about. And it is certainly his belief, as you saw embodied in his budget document, that we need to reduce our deficit, but do it in a way that allows our economy to grow and secure the middle class. A readout on that? I will take the question and we will see. Yes, Peter. Thanks, ENTITY. Just staying with the business meeting for a moment, can you talk about why it is important for the President -- or if the President believes it is important to do this outreach to business? And also, do you think that the outreach in the second term has stepped up or we are seeing more of it than we did in the first term? I think the outreach that we have seen has been ongoing. And our outreach includes not just obviously to business, but to a whole range of sectors of the American economy and a variety of groups with different interests. And that is as it should be and continues. I think what you have seen from the White House is an engagement with business around the simple proposition that we need to take steps to reform our immigration system because that is good for the economy and good for the middle class. We need to take steps to reduce gun violence, and there are some business leaders who are very much interested in that effort. And we need to take common-sense steps to grow our economy and reduce our deficit, and that is obviously of interest to the business sector. Thanks. ENTITY, on drone strikes, I wanted to ask you about -- the President has said that the only targets of drone strikes are senior operational leaders of al Qaeda and associated forces whom you know are involved somehow in some plotting of attacks against the U.S. Can you explain why classified U.S. intelligence documents that McClatchy has reviewed suggest otherwise? I, as you would expect, am not going to talk about classified documents that others would have obtained. I can tell you that our strategy in dealing with counterterrorism is to utilize the tools available to us. When it comes to the means with which we do that, the President has addressed it and we have been, as an administration, very transparent through a series of speeches by John Brennan, the Attorney General and by others, as well as comments by the President, about the approach that we take in that effort. But can you explain -- some of the documents suggested that there -- Again, ENTITY, you are not going to get me to comment on classified information. Any legal justification, though, for strikes that suggest you have been working with Pakistan and targeting their insurgents -- Again, I do not have any comment on what you are representing as classified information. Thanks, ENTITY. Returning to Beyonc and Jay-Z -- Jay-Z released a rap today. I know the other day you said that Treasury was the one that cleared their trip. He suggested that he got White House clearance and that he personally spoke with the President. I will just quote: I turned Havana into Atlanta/ Boy from the hood got White House clearance/ Obama said, 'Chill, you gonna get me impeached'/ You do not need this anyway/ Chill with me on the beach. I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury. Because Treasury offers and gives licenses for travel, as you know, and the White House has nothing to do with it. So are you saying that he did not -- the President did not have a conversation with Jay-Z? I am absolutely saying that the White House, from the President on down, had nothing to do with anybody's personal -- anybody's travel to Cuba. That is something that Treasury handles. You cannot rhyme that? OFAC, Treasury -- these are tough words to rhyme. Did he communicate with -- It is a song, Donovan. The President did not communicate with Jay-Z over this trip. ENTITY? Yes.ENTITY, do you have something? Oh, good. Let me read this while I have it, which is in answer -- or part answer about our response to the cloture vote. I wanted to let you know that following the Senate's cloture vote, President Obama spoke by phone with family members of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy who are here in Washington, D.C. to ask Congress to pass common-sense measures to reduce gun violence. The President congratulated the families on this important step forward, noting that the bipartisan progress would not have been possible without their efforts. He reiterated that much work remains, and pledged to continue fighting for the votes they deserve. Just to follow up on Syria, al Qaeda in Iraq released on Monday a statement saying they were joining in Syria some opposition groups. What is your reaction? And how can you make sure that the money you are going to provide to some opposition groups are not going to end up in those al Qaeda supporters? Well, we work with the Syrian Opposition Coalition, and we obviously are interested in helping and assisting in their consolidation and organization and their overall efforts -- the opposition in Syria that is committed to democratic principles and that is committed to a brighter and more democratic future for Syria. There is no question, and this is a concern around the region, that extremist elements try to take advantage of, in a variety of areas, including Syria, the kind of upheaval that you have seen in a tragedy like Syria. And that is obviously of concern to us, and we monitor it regularly. But we are focused on assisting the opposition, the Syrian Opposition Coalition, and the members of the broader Syrian opposition that are committed to a more democratic future for Syria. And I just have another question related to huge breaking news in France and Europe at this moment. The budget minister of Franois Hollande lied to the people in France about a hidden Swiss account when he was trying to do something about the tax evasion. What is your reaction to that? And what will you say for public officials in terms of probity? Well, I am not aware of that and I will not comment on what seems to be an internal matter in France. So I really do not have a response. ENTITY? Yes, ENTITY. I have two questions. Thank you, sir. One, yesterday, hundreds of minorities from Bangladesh, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, were demonstrating outside the White House. What they were saying, a message for the President that it should read that they are being targeted in Bangladesh because of their race and religion and their beliefs. And whenever there is a problem in Bangladesh and minorities are under attack by the extremists and groups. Any comments on their -- I do not have a specific response to the demonstration. Obviously, the administration and the President support the civil rights of peoples around the world, but I am just not aware of the specific demonstration or the issues in terms of a presidential response. And as far as guns are concerned, yesterday hundreds of Sikhs were at the Indian Embassy celebrating the Vaisakhi, their national holiday. And talking to them, what they are saying that among them were the families of the victims from Oak Creek, Wisconsin. What they are saying is that guns kill -- it does not matter how many rounds, and it should be banned at all completely, because as long as guns are in the wrong hands of the people, there will be -- people will be killed. And that is the message they were telling me to send to the President and to the Congress. The President's approach is one that embraces common-sense measures to reduce gun violence that do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the American people, Second Amendment rights that the President supports. And you have seen that reflected in the legislation that he supports up on Capitol Hill and in the set of proposals that he made and announced together with the Vice President earlier this year. Sorry, let me move on. Just a question on the Middle East. You were asked last week about the series of leaders coming to visit and talk with the President. Can you talk about the importance the President attaches to having President Morsi here? Will that happen possibly before the G8? He is a major Arab Spring leader. Just, generally, the importance of that? I know you are not going to read out any visit plans. Well, I have no announcements to make beyond -- about visits beyond the ones that we already have announced, and which you made note of, and that is that the President will be hosting his counterparts from the UAE, from Qatar, Jordan and Turkey in Washington over the next several weeks. There will be a variety of topics. Syria will certainly be one of them. Our relationship with Egypt is and has been very important, and we continue to engage with the Egyptian government. I just do not have any particular next engagement to announce to you at the presidential level. The information also of the $200 million in aid for Jordan that was announced in Amman, can you take that question and get it to us? Well, I have to take it. I am sure the State Department would be a good place to go for more details about it. All the way back, yes. Back to the budget, if the President's deficit reduction plan is enacted, how many jobs would be lost under his plan as opposed to sequestration? The President's budget will increase job growth in the United States. It includes, in stark contrast to alternatives, investments that will create jobs. It includes tax cuts targeted to small businesses, for example, who hire veterans or small businesses who increase the size of their payroll, for example. It includes investments in infrastructure that will lead to immediate job creation as well as future economic growth and job creation because of the improvements in our roads, bridges, ports, and airports. So the President's -- it is an excellent question because the President's budget proposal, which contains within it his deficit reduction offer to the Speaker, has to be looked at as a whole because it is the President's number-one priority to take measures that help the economy grow, that help it create jobs, that secure and grow the middle class, and reduce our deficit in a responsible way. And the whole point that he was trying to make, and I think he made very well in the Rose Garden, is that you can do that. You can, if you go about it in a responsible way -- and responsible is certainly not what the sequester represents -- but if you go about deficit reduction in a responsible way, you can do it and also invest in our economy in a way that allows it to grow and create jobs. But do you have a number? Because I do not see how you can cut $1.2 trillion and it not cost some jobs despite the infrastructure. The fact is you can, as we have seen, reduce the deficit in a responsible way. If you do it in a responsible way and do not embrace extremist positions or absolutist positions that would do harm to economic growth and job creation, as well as compound that harm by slashing investments that the middle class depends on, or voucherizing Medicare in a way that harms seniors, you can reduce our deficit in a responsible way that ensures that the economy will continue to grow and create jobs. And if you do it in a balanced way, in a responsible way, if you build on the $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction the President has already signed into law, and you add to it the $1.8 trillion that his deficit reduction plan represents, you will have cleared the $4-trillion threshold of deficit reduction that economists say is key to getting our fiscal situation stabilized and reducing the deficit-to-GDP ratio by 2023 to below 2 percent. You can do that and continue to grow the economy. And the President made clear that it is much harder and in some cases impossible to reduce our deficit if the economy is not growing. That is why we cannot take action that would do the kind of harm to the economy that, for example, the sequester does because the sequester's negative impact is due in part to its arbitrary nature, that it was written in a way that was designed purposely never to become law. You need instead to do it the way that the President has presented in his budget. Thanks, ENTITY.

{"id": 109, "text": "Here now, on the Imus in the Morning program, ENTITY. Good morning, ENTITY. Good morning, Don, how are you? Well, I am not that great, because your wife was here in New York 2 or 3 months ago to do that Sesame Street, and it is broadcast from the same studio complex we are. So she sent down the Secret Service to get me. And of course, when they showed I did not know what they were here for. It made me kind of nervous. But anyway, I was talking to her, and I told her that since I had last talked to you I had had major lung surgery, and I have health insurance. And out of my pocket, though, even with health insurance, it cost me $20,000. So I am for any health care plan--including yours. Well, that is good. I hope the surgery worked well. Your lungs seem to be in good order as nearly as I can tell. Well, I feel pretty good. She was astonished that it cost that much. I explained that I was in a private room and stuff like that. But still, there was a lot of expense. And I- just curious to me how ordinary people, the median wage in this country being around $19,000 a year, how they could pay for that stuff. Well, it is really tough. She was in Maine last week and talking to a woman that broke her wrist and was charged $40 for sitting on a cot in a hospital in an emergency room for 30 minutes, charged for an Ace bandage she did not use and things like that. There are a lot of problems in the health care system, mostly related to the way we finance it. The health care of this country-the delivery system, the doctors, the nurses, the medical research, all of that-it is very, very good. But the delivery system is messed up by the way it is financed. This is the only country in the world that has 1,500 separate health insurance companies writing thousands and thousands of different policies. You have got to read the fine print to figure out what is the copay, what is the deductible, how much cash do you have to put up if you have something like the operation you had. It is a really tough deal. Well, you know, one of the ways, ENTITY, you could settle all this is for you and the First Lady to take on Harry and Louise from those insurance company commercials in like a segment of American Gladiators. Yes, you know, I would not mind that actually. The first I heard about them, I thought they were Thelma and Louise, you know. I tried to take them on a little bit yesterday in New Jersey. The problem is that they do not reflect real people, but they can scare real people because when we hear something about health care, we always want to calculate it, as we should, in terms of, well, how is this going to affect me and my family and our policy. But real people out there are in trouble. I mean, I was at a little delicatessen in Columbus, Ohio, the day before yesterday talking to the woman who ran it, and she insured her 20 full-time employees even though a lot of her competitors did not . She told me the stories about what had happened to their premiums when she got sick, how much she resented the fact that she did it and others did not . I mean, if you really go out there and talk to real people about how the system really works, it is very different than what these ads say. And the ads are designed to mislead people about our plan so that we can keep the same financing system we have got. That is why the health insurance industry's running them. But as a result of the way they do things, some people pay much more for insurance than others because they are older. Some people pay more just because they are in small businesses. Some people cannot get any insurance or can never change jobs because they have got a preexisting condition. No other country in the world does this. But one thing we do have more than anybody else in the world is clerical workers, in hospitals, in doctors' offices, insurance offices, keeping up with all these forms that are required so we can see who does not get what coverage and make sure you pay all that $20,000. I mean, that is the way the financing system works. That is what needs to be reworked. When you and the First Lady lobbied the Business Council, and they voted two-to-one against the plan, were you surprised about that or-- No, they have never-you know, mostly they have not been for any of this. I was surprised that we have as much big business support as we do. What I wanted them to do, although it is largely ideological, most of them are paying premiums which are too high now. I thought we might get them for the first time to go along with the requirement for universal coverage or guaranteed private health insurance, because every other country has it. That is what their competitors provide. And all their competitors have lower health costs than these guys do. But I was very disappointed that they did not do it. Now, the Chamber of Commerce came out for universal coverage yesterday, which was encouraging. But the big business group I still think supports universal coverage. There were some other-they have got some members who do not support some parts of our plan. And the group that came to see me said that, Well, we really are not for this other plan. We think it is better strategy to say, 'Well, we ought to start with that. ' But the truth is, you know, I did not expect them to be in the vanguard of health care reform. But a lot of these big companies actually are paying more than they should because of all the cost-shifting. That is another big problem in our system. A lot of people who do not have health insurance ultimately get health care, but they get it when it is too late and too expensive. They show up at the emergency room, and then the hospitals have to pass those costs on to the people who do have insurance, which really runs the cost up of companies that have good health policies. A lot of these mainstream news friends of mine who appear frequently on this program, like Tim Russert and folks like that, they think that I hang out with you, you know, and like set policy. Do not disabuse them, you know. Is Russert-is that mainstream? I do not know. I try to explain to them, I have talked to you five or six times on the phone, and I am not one of those people who claims to have access that does not exist. However-- I have still got my ENTITY doll in here, though, in the White House. Oh, you do? You bet I do. I watch that head bob up and down all the time. You know, by the way, thanks for the pictures you sent me. I was doing an interview with the Washington Post the day those arrived. And this woman begged me to give her one of them so she could put it in the paper. And I said I did not think ENTITY would be interested in doing that. But one of the things I tell people is that having talked to you four or five times during the campaign and now twice since you have been ENTITY, I said I thought that probably I had changed more in my approach in that, you know, you are ENTITY, and I am not going to ask you goofy questions. And my question to you is, do you think you have changed? Oh, I think it changes you some. What you have to guard against is getting the bad changes with the good. I mean, I think anyone who assumes this office who really wants to make a difference here instead of just to occupy the White House changes. I think, you know, I am much more focused every day than I have ever been in my public life on the work at hand and what I can do. I think that the responsibilities are so great it requires much more concentration. And you just have to kind of filter out a whole lot of things that once might have occupied your time and attention. On the other hand, you have to guard against becoming more isolated, because it is so easy to get isolated here. I mean, you have got to- because of the security concerns, the Secret Service is always here and you are always-you travel in an armored limousine and you travel on Air Force One and you are always-it is just easy to get isolated from the people. So what I have to do is to try to make sure that I am growing in the job all the time and continuing to deepen my ability just to focus on the big issues that really affect the lives of the American people without getting isolated from them. Somebody said the White House is the crown jewel in our penal system. Yes, that was one of my better lines, did you think? Oh, that was yours. Oh, okay. Yes. I said I could not figure out whether it was America's most beautiful public housing or the crown jewel of the penal system. Of course, I guess I could ask you, the bed in that old El Camino was not large enough to play football on, so, ENTITY, what was that Astroturf for? You are old enough to remember what it was like with a pickup truck, nothing but metal in the back, right? Absolutely. If you wanted to put-that is the only car I had then. I carried my luggage back there. It was not for what everybody thought it was for when I made the comment, I will tell you that. I am guilty of a lot of things, but I did not ever do that. But I do not think I should disclaim it, really, just leave it out there. I mean, it is like saying you did not inhale, ENTITY. I mean, come on here. Anyway, by the way, congratulations on that Saudi-- No, it is just that I did not inhale in the back of the pickup. Congratulations on the Saudi aircraft deal. Mickey Kantor's doing a terrific job, is not he? He is doing a great job. I mean, he is really been very, very good. You know, he is hammered out these major trade agreements, the NAFTA agreement and the GATT world trade round. And he is worked so hard to expand our trade operations. On this Saudi deal, we had three Cabinet members actually go to Saudi Arabia working on it: the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, whose major job it is to sell American products abroad, once Mickey Kantor gets us a fair framework; the Transportation Secretary, because it was airlines, Federico Pena; and the Secretary of State because it affected our foreign policy. They all went through Saudi Arabia and made an effort to help sell it. And you know, this is going to have a positive impact on about 60,000 jobs, which is an amazing thing. And this may be a simple-minded trade question, ENTITY, but people like me wonder about this. How come we cannot say to the Japanese, Look, you guys cannot send your junk over here until you let us send our stuff over there, and that policy starts tomorrow ? Well, you can do some of that. That is what we are trying to do with this telephone issue. I guess you saw the facts-when you mentioned Mickey, you must have seen him doing his interview on the cellular telephone-- Yes, I did. --business, where he pointed out in the part of Japan where we have equal access, Motorola has 50 percent of the market. And in the Tokyo and Nagoya area, same products, where there is not equal access to take advantage of the whole system, the Japanese have 780,000 or something units, and Motorola has 12,000, less than 2 percent of the market. So we have now concluded that case. We have established the facts, and we have to develop a response. But what you want to do is to do something that will succeed in opening their market without denying American consumers access to products they want to buy or without hurting American investments in Japan. We have increased exports to Japan dramatically, but exports from Japan to America have increased dramatically. And their markets are still the most closed of any advanced country in the world. So in the past, America for 10 years tried 30 different trade agreements, the main focus of which was to change the processes by which they dealt with, instead of to, you know, achieve specific concrete results. And nothing ever happened. I mean, the trade deficit just got bigger and bigger. So we are going to try to pursue a much more aggressive policy now which will actually open markets. And I might say there is a lot of people in Japan who agree with us. This is a problem for them, too, because as rich as that country is, the average Japanese pays almost 40 percent more for consumer products than the average American because their market's so closed. So it is not good for them either. They simply cannot continue to pursue the policy that they pursued when they were a poor country growing rich. They are now a rich country, and they cannot export to the rest of the world and keep their own markets closed. And I think they know that. And we are going to work hard and try some different things to push that market open. But there are a lot of people in Japan who agree with us. Of course, he was really aggressive, obviously, as you know, I mean, suggesting that they'd lied and broken that '88 agreement. I mean, he was pretty brutal there-- Well, they did not do what they said they'd do in '88. And last summer they said that we would have a trade agreement which would deal with autos and electronics and a lot of other issues-telecommunications-that would measure the results of our progress in qualitative and quantitative terms, which is a jargon phrase which means we will see whether we are reducing the trade deficit or not. And they did not want to do that here. So there is a big fight going on in Japan now. The permanent government agencies there that have dominated policy for years and years, for decades, the trade and finance agencies, think the system they have had has worked. It is given them low unemployment and high savings rates, big exports and no imports, and they want to keep it. There are a lot of other people that want Japan to become a fully modern state with fair and open trade. And I think in a way we are helping the cause of the reformers by being tougher than America has been in the past on this issue in trying to get these markets open for our people. When the word got out around, particularly here in New York, yesterday that you were going to be on, all my friends at the networks called me and they said, Ask him this, and ask him that. And I'd tell them, I'd say, You ask him, because I am not presumptuous enough to think I am Ted Koppel or Tim Russert. I mean, our agenda here is to make you laugh, which we have done. But are they presumptuous enough to think they are you, that is -- No, they are not. Let me try to get some information, and the next time you have a gig at the White House we want to get you to book Delbert McClinton, because he is great. Do you know who Delbert is? Who is Delbert? Oh, he is great. Man, you'd love him. If you love Elvis, you will love Delbert McClinton. Sings that Texas blues. I like that Texas blues. Oh, you'd love him. I am going to send you a CD. I will send it to my new best friend, Mark Gearan. I will send it to him. He can give it to you. Are you hard up for a best friend? If you looked at Mark Gearan, if you can just look at him, he never- I do not believe he ever saw a country and western singer, much less heard one. Well, maybe I will send it to Paul Begala then. He is got a 1950's haircut. I do have a math question, though. It is sort of like one of those, if Bill leaves L.A. traveling 55 miles an hour, and Bob leaves New York traveling 60 miles an hour, when will they each reach Sioux City, Iowa? So here is the question, You are the Governor of Arkansas making $35,000 a year, and Mrs. Clinton's over at the law firm making around $55,000. And out of what looks like a gross to me of around $90,000, how did you guys manage to lose $69,000 in that goofy Whitewater land deal? Oh, because we lost it over a long period of time. Oh, okay. Most of it, the loss, was when we paid the bank loans back with interest, and we never got any money on the interest. So it happened over a long period of time. Is that something that you think is going to-everybody I have on I ask this, and I have wanted to ask you. In your mind, is that something-I mean, are you guys sitting around there thinking this is going to turn into Watergate? No. No. No, it is an investment I made 15 years ago that lost money instead of made money, because the property market turned around at home. It is a simple, straightforward thing, and it'll be shown to be. I mean, I am absolutely comfortable with that. I mean, I am amazed by all the twists and turns of interpretation that is been given. But that is about what happened. Because I have had a bad run of luck here, I endorsed David Dinkins; I endorsed Jim Florio; I was supporting Barry Diller in his takeover for Paramount, so I do not need anything to happen to you now. Well, there are a lot of folks that come after us on a regular basis. I wish they'd fight with us on the issues instead of what they do, but that is part of it. Apparently that is part of being ENTITY in the latter half of the 20th century in a highly competitive environment. All I know is I get up every day, show up for work, work as hard as I can, try to help people improve their lives, and that is what I am going to keep doing. And the ones that want to keep attacking me, I am going to let them do it and just do the very best I can with it. And I will try to make your gamble good. I do not want you to be disappointed, but- -keep in mind, sometimes if you make choices, sometimes you are going to lose. All your politicians cannot win. It is like going to the horse races. Of course, you notice how I have turned this into how it is going to affect me as opposed to your Presidency and the future of this country and the free world. That is probably, you know-- Let me say this: I do not mean to be disrespectful, but that vacation, that model home, that looked like someplace where Tonya Harding's bodyguards were holed up--no wonder you guys could not sell them. Well, you know, it was a little place where a lot of working people without much money were looking for a place to retire and own some property in a beautiful place. And by the way, north Arkansas is full of folks like that. They are good people, even if they are not rich. I know that now that you have hit the big time, it is not worthy of you, but if you- -maybe if you could guarantee me a profit I could go build a house on a piece of land down there, and I could let you retire in Arkansas. Actually, the guy I have worked with for 22 years, Charles McCord, has a house right on the shore there of Bull Shoals Lake, right there in Lead Hill, Arkansas. In Lead Hill, which is near Zinc. Charles McCord. Exactly, 10 miles from Zinc, yes, sir. You have been there? Mr. McCord. I built a vacation home there, ENTITY. Oh, there you are. It is beautiful, is not it? Mr. McCord. It is one of the most gorgeous parts of this country, period, and absolutely, northeastern Arkansas, the Buffalo River country, all of that, absolutely. ENTITY, the United States- I just wanted to ask you briefly about Bosnia- the United States has always, in my mind, at least, set the agenda for NATO. But in the case of Bosnia, it seems that we are acquiescing to them. As the lone superpower in the world, are not they really, bottom line, looking to us to do what we have always done? Well, that is what we were able to do in getting the resolution through last summer, authorizing the use of air power if Sarajevo was strangled. And then we and the French and then eventually the Germans and the British and all the others, agreed after this last terrible incident in the market in Sarajevo to strengthen that resolution and say that there ought to be basically an artillery-free zone around Sarajevo, which is what we are in the business of implementing now. The difference is this-I know it is confusing-but basically the United Nations is on the ground in Bosnia. And the United Nations includes troops on the ground, includes troops from NATO countries. There are British troops on the ground; there are French troops on the ground; there are Canadian troops on the ground; there are Spanish troops on the ground; there are about to be some Dutch troops on the ground. A lot of these countries did not want NATO to use air power to protect Sarajevo or do anything else because they were afraid that their troops on the ground would be attacked and killed, and we did not have any troops on the ground. And when I said I thought that the arms embargo ought to be lifted, a lot of those countries said, Well, you may be right, but we are afraid for our troops on the ground who are there fulfilling the U.N. mission trying to keep people alive and deliver food and medicine, and keep the roads open. So to be fair to them, they were in a different position. Now I think that the United States has finally succeeded in-and I told the allies at the NATO meeting in January we could not have an empty threat. So the Serbs now, I think, must know that if they do not comply, NATO will take action. And the United States has been pushing this for a long time. And I think we finally succeeded in bringing our allies around. I think a lot of them finally figured out that their troops on the ground were at greater risk by doing nothing than they were by taking action. But to be fair to the NATO allies, the United States has not put ground troops in Bosnia. I did not think we should. But because they had them there fulfilling the U.N. mandate, they were reluctant to have NATO bomb, because they were afraid of retaliation against their soldiers. Now I think, we have sent a clear message to the Serbs. And I think everybody will hold tight. And we have got a chance. We have got a chance to really not only protect Sarajevo but to get a peace agreement that is decent and fair. And that is what we are going to be working for. A final question, ENTITY, your cholesterol is around 204, right? No, no, it is down now, I think. Oh, it is? Well, I do not know, I think it is -what was it? Is that what it was? Yes. Yes, I lost 15 pounds, but my cholesterol is still too high. Yes, but the other day I read about the Clinton burger and that pastrami sandwich and that apple fritter the size of a baby's head. Hey, hey, the apple fritter- I had one bite of apple fritter. Oh, okay. That is right, I did get off my diet that day. But I was transported. I mean, I was out there in a place I felt at home in. I was in a little town in Ohio, you know, and I spoke to all those police officers, and I stopped at this little deli with this guy who had been a butcher's assistant when he was 13 years old and had finally saved enough money to open his own deli 3 years ago. And he built it with his hands, and he made this Clinton burger, And I thought, well, I am going to eat it. He did it. And then I went to this restaurant in downtown Columbus and talked to those folks about health care. And I asked them what they thought I ought to have, and they said I ought to try the corned beef on pumpernickel. So that is what I did. They said that is what was good, so I tried it. Every now and then I lose my discipline. But I lost 15 pounds last year, and I am going to try to lose 10 or 15 more this year. I like it better. I do not like to diet, but I like the way I feel when I am a little bit lighter. ENTITY, you were terrific. It is always great to have you on. Thank you very much. Well, thank you. Do not lose your sense of humor now just because I am ENTITY. No, I will not . Just give my adversaries equal time, that is all I ask. Thanks. Have a good day.

{"id": 151, "text": "What do you expect to be accomplished out of Tokyo summit? And what special roles do you see Japan can play in areas beyond economic constitution in--of global partners with the United States? First, let me say I think the G-7 meeting will be a very important opportunity for the leaders of the major industrialized countries of the world to reaffirm their commitment to global growth, to democracy, and to security concerns. I believe there will be serious discussions about three issues on the economic front, one really perhaps for the first time. The first is that I think there will be a real discussion about how we can coordinate our economic policies in ways that will produce growth. From the first week I was in office, we have spent a lot of time working through the finance ministers, the foreign ministers, and others to talk about how we can coordinate our strategies. For many years, other nations have asked the United States, for example, to lower the budget deficit. And we are working very hard on that, first through this $500 billion deficit reduction program that has now been passed by both Houses of our Congress, then through taking on a health care problem which is the biggest source of our growing deficit. And we need to make sure we are coordinating those policies with things which will produce an overall higher level of growth than we now have. It is a big problem for the United States, because two-thirds of the new jobs we have created here in the last 5 years have come from increased trade with other nations. So if Europe is down economically, if Japan is down economically, it is hard for us to do well here. So I think there will be that. The second issue I think that we will discuss and, I hope, make some genuine progress on, creating a more open trading system and increasing the chances that we can successfully conclude GATT by the end of the year. The third thing that I hope to see a very serious discussion on is the microeconomic policies of each of our nations and how we can all do a better job of creating jobs within our economy. Even Japan, with its very low unemployment rate by western standards, is having some trouble now creating new jobs. But it is a very big problem for the United States and for every other country represented around this room today. And I think that increasingly in a global economy, national policy will have to focus on what the economists call microeconomic policies: What kind of labor support systems do you have; what kind of education and training systems do you have; how do you target investment to create jobs? The west, and increasingly Japan, are having difficulty creating new jobs, even in times of economic growth. It is quite interesting. If you trace the last 6 or 7 years you can see that in all the western nations, even when there is growth, there is some trouble creating new jobs. So I think that this will all be-we will deal with this, and I hope in a very informal and forthright atmosphere. It will be an interesting summit, because there will be several of the people there attending their very first one, first G-7, all at the same time. The second point you made about Japan's role in the world, I am going to do what I can while in Japan to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the United States and Japan. In many, many ways it is our most significant bilateral relationship and the key to what happens between the United States and Asia. It is interesting, even though we have incredibly important ties to Europe, economic ties, we have a huge-40 percent of our trade is now with the Pacific. It accounts for almost 2 1/2 million jobs in America, trade with the Pacific. So it is a big issue. And we have major security concerns, as you know, with regard to Japan and with Korea. So I am very hopeful that even though Japan is going through a period of political transition, which I hope the Japanese people will view with excitement and interest, not with too much concern, this is a normal thing for a democracy. And periodically you go through these periods of significant change, and I view it as a positive thing for a great country. I think it will leave you stronger and in a better position in the world. So I hope we will discuss a lot of our bilateral economic as well as strategic concerns there. And I hope that when I leave Japan, our relationship will be even stronger than it is when I enter. ENTITY, there was a court decision this week that is a roadblock to ratification of the NAFTA agreement. Your administration has said that you will go ahead, but you do not appear to have a lot of wiggle room in Congress on some of your other economic initiatives. And I am wondering, first of all, how you are going to ensure the passage of NAFTA. And secondly, on the eve of the summit, this raises the whole issue of the conflict between environmental concerns and economic growth, and whether it is drift nets in the Pacific or toxic waste in Mexico or the whole problem of aid to the former Soviet Union, that conflict between the environment and economic growth underlies a lot of these issues. And I am wondering how you see reconciling those issues at the G-7. Let me mention the NAFTA first and then I will answer the larger question. First, on the narrow issue of the lawsuit, we announced within an hour after the court's decision that we would appeal. And we believe we can win an appeal, and we can win it within the appropriate time. There may also be some other avenues which will permit us to do some kind of environmental impact statement and still meet the time limit. There is a strong opposition to the agreement in some quarters in the United States, and the relative economic problems that we all face now make that more difficult. That is, when unemployment is up and growth is down, people are more insecure. It makes some in Europe less enthusiastic about the GATT now. It is the same reason-it is just-a part of it is almost endemic to the human condition. I do think we have the votes to pass NAFTA in the United States Senate. And I think that-and we do not have today the votes to pass it in the United States House. But I think we can get the votes to pass it essentially by doing three things: First of all, by successfully concluding the agreements now subject to negotiation between Canada and Mexico and the United States to strengthen our common efforts at lifting labor standards and environmental quality, particularly along the Rio Grande River, which has been a huge problem. And I should say by way of background for the rest of you, the reason the labor standards issue is so big is that there was a report issued in this country last year that indicated that the Caribbean Basin Initiative of the United States, where we tried to get investment in Caribbean countries and put plants down there, had not led to increasing the per capita incomes of the people working in those businesses; that because the people were so poor, that a lot of the people who had taken the money that the United States Government had put out had still depressed their wages and increased their profits. So we have given some thought to this labor standards issue here and the environmental issue. So I think if we get those agreements that will help. The second thing that will help is if we have to just make the case, you know. Now when we have an agreement, it is a lot easier to defend the jobs argument. Right now there is a simple argument against NAFTA being waged by, articulated by Mr. Perot in this country and others, that you cannot make a trade agreement that takes down all the barriers with a country on your border with a per capita income that is only one-eighth as much as yours is. Everybody will take their money and invest in the other country. Well, it has great superficial appeal, but the truth is that anybody who wants to go to Mexico and invest their money for low wages can do so today. But the market opening measures that have been taken by President Salinas in the last few years have led the United States from a $5 billion trade deficit to a $6 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Mexico is now our second biggest purchaser-manufacturer. And we are in effect because Canada, as you know, is our biggest trade partner-we are now building this hemispheric economic bloc that we want. And so I think we can refute it on the merits. The third thing we have to do is ask the economists to consider what will happen if we do not pass the trade agreement. Our relationships with Canada are secure, and we have a bilateral agreement, and that is fine. But we could go back in our relationships with Mexico, which would mean economic problems for Mexico, more trade barriers, fewer jobs in America, more illegal immigration. A lot of problems could develop for the United States if we do not do the NAFTA. I think when those three things become crystal clear, we will prevail there. Now on the larger issue, there is no easy or simple answer to the conflict between the environment and the economy in any of our countries individually or in the globe as a whole. However, I believe that our goal ought to be to find ways to make preserving the environment good economics. At the Rio conference last year, Japan, Germany, and many other European countries were proving that you could do that because they were down there promoting environmental technology while the United States was trying to stop the environmental agreements. I think that our country was not as wise as many of the nations here represented in the way they approached the Rio conference. We have now signed on, the United States has, to the Biodiversity Treaty. And we have basically adopted a policy of long-term environmental preservation with an aggressive effort to figure out how to make jobs and incomes and prosperity flow out of that. And I believe that there are lots of opportunities to do that. If I might just mention one, our bilateral aid package to Russia that is now making its way to the Congress focuses heavily on what we can do with our technology to help them to reduce the problems that their nuclear industry-and not simply their bombs but their nuclear power plants, for example-present to them, and what else we can do in the area of energy and the environment to help to clean up their environment in ways that are good for their economy and good for ours. So I think there is a lot of opportunity there. You just said in the beginning, ENTITY, that you hoped that Tokyo would, and I quote you, increase the chances of successfully concluding a Uruguay round by the end of the year. Can I turn that around and say do you think that a failure to do that would seriously jeopardize the whole G-7 process as it currently exists? Well, there are lots of other nations involved in the Uruguay round apart front the G-7. That was one point that Prime Minister Balladur made to me in our meeting here. But I think that our job is to lead. And I know it is difficult to lead when you have troubles yourself. All of us have economic troubles. All of us, to a greater or lesser extent, have some political conflict within our countries. But I think that it is very important-and almost to change the atmosphere and the attitudes of the peoples of the G-7. Yes, we are having economic trouble. And the fact that we are all having it should be some indication that there is some sort of historic change going on here and not that there is some character flaw in our people or some great mental breakdown in our countries or something else. This is a tidal wave of global change going on here. But look at the resources we have: We have innovative work forces; we have great bases of technology; we have an understanding of how the world works economically. And I think we have within our power the means to move forward and break out of this problem we are in but only if we have the courage to keep changing. And so I would say, to try to answer your question directly, there have been debates for years about whether the C, -7 process accomplishes anything. But if nothing else, if we can agree among ourselves to take an expansive view of the future and to talk about the strengths of our nations and to recognize that there are only three ways to grow our economies. One is through the changes we make internally, the microeconomic changes; the other is through coordinating our larger macroeconomic policies; and the last is through creating a more open system of trade so that there is global growth. It is hard for the wealthy countries to grow wealthier unless the people below us are getting wealthier and can buy more of our products. It is not a zero-sum game. And so I feel very strongly that we ought to come out of the G7 with a more vigorous commitment to get the Uruguay round done. Now let me just say what I have done in that regard. I have repeatedly said that the United States would bend over backwards to get that done this year, that there are changes that we would like to make. When the C-7 finance ministers and central bank heads were here not very long ago at Blair House across the street, I went over and personally met with all of them and reaffirmed my commitment to this. So I do not know what else I can do, except that I think a lot of this is a matter of attitude. We have to try to lift our own visions and lift the spirits of our people and realize that when you are in difficulty, the worst thing you can do is to hunker down, to withdraw. When you have difficulties like this with a fundamentally sound system, the time is to change, to be innovative, to be creative, and to reach out. And I think that is what we have got to begin to do at the G-7. The tone, the atmosphere, the ideas that are discussed in that sense may be far more important than anything specific that comes out of the communiqu?. What direction are we going to take the world in? ENTITY, nobody seems to be happy with the G-7 process, not to mention the results. I wonder if you could define for us-elaborate on what you just said-that the purpose of the G-7 in today's world and tell us what you would like to change. Well, I do not want to be too presumptuous, since I have never attended one before. I have only read about them before. You know, I always followed them very closely. But what we are striving for-I think the other leaders agree with me, including those like Chancellor Kohl, who is been to many of these. My own view is there ought to be enough time at these C, -7 meetings for a serious discussion among the leaders without a lot of bureaucratic procedures and rules and regulations about these big issues. What about the crisis in the wealthy countries creating jobs? What can we do to create more jobs? How do you explain the fact that France, for example-let us take France. France had a productivity growth rate that was the highest in Europe in some of the years of the late eighties and still had relatively high unemployment. The United States, which has far fewer labor supports than most of the European countries do, still has difficulty getting its unemployment rate below 7 percent. We are well into 2 years after the worst of our recession, and yet we are 3 million jobs behind where we would ordinarily be at this point after a recession. We should discuss these things, and we should think about whether we can learn things from one another about how to create jobs in the west. We should be able to really talk through very frankly what the political and other economic barriers are to getting the GATT done and really think about it and talk about it. It is far more important than what is in the specific words of the communiqu?, whether we come out of there with some sort of commitment to do something, to take action, and to move. And finally, I think we ought to really focus on how our individual economic strategies may not work as well unless we are coordinated. Let me just give you one example. I am trying to do something that our country has not done before. We are trying to dramatically cut our Government deficit at a time when our economic growth is slow. Traditional economic theory would say if you have a sluggish economy, you do not cut spending and raise taxes; you might do the reverse, right? Why am I trying to do that? Because we are in a global economy, and the United States deficit caused an imbalance in the global economy, okay? But now, this can work for us for a while just on our own, because we had so much debt in the 1980's accumulated at high interest rates, by bringing down the deficit, interest rates in America have dropped very low. So businesses and homeowners are going out now and refinancing their debt, and that puts a lot of new money into our economy. So I can get a little bit of growth just on what we do here. But in the end, this will only work if there is an expansionary policy in Japan, if Europe is able to resume a higher level of growth so that the system is brought into balance, because what we do has a complementary action in the rest of the G-7. So these are the things, it seems to me, that really matter. And that is why I think these G7 meetings can really make a difference. But I think that if we get all hung up on-you know, we all have to have these prepared statements, and we are afraid we are going to say one word out of the way or make one little mistake which makes a huge headline in some country. And then we have got to have every little word right in these communiqu?s. I think that is just-that takes a lot of time and energy away from what we should be doing, which is focusing on how we can make the lives of our people better and fulfill our responsibilities as leaders of the world. ENTITY, you said earlier, speaking of G-7 leaders, that their job is to lead. Yet there is a broad perception that there is real friction and misunderstanding and doubts about U.S. willingness to lead, not only in the Japan-U.S. relationship, but in the U.S.-European relationship. Why has this happened and what can you do at the summit to clarify U.S. goals and reassure U.S. allies? Well, let me first of all take issue with you-I mean, not the perception. The other nations of the world have asked the United States for years and years and years internally to do one thing. The only thing they ever asked of us internally was to do something about our budget deficit, which caused a significant imbalance in the global economic relations. I read about it for years before I became ENTITY. And we are doing that, and it is very tough to do in tough economic times. And we are going to wind up with a very tough deficit reduction plan that we believe is good for our economy over the long run. And it is not been easy to do, but we are doing that. Secondly, the major crisis this world has faced since I have been ENTITY, I think, was what would happen to democracy in Russia. And when it became apparent that democracy was in trouble in Russia because of what was happening with President Yeltsin, I immediately publicly supported him. I called every other leader in the G-7 and many others around the world and asked for people to support him. We all did. And I think that we had something to do with the outcome of events there. I announced a $1.6 billion aid package to Russia, and we have now, by the way, obligated well over half of that money. And then I announced another $1.8 billion bilateral aid package to Russia which passed the House of Representatives with 75 percent of the vote almost last week, bipartisan support. It is going to fly through the Senate. The IMF gave their first installment, $1.5 billion, to Russia the day before yesterday, and we are going to discuss that at the G-7 summit. I think-and that is a huge potential market for all of us and a major political issue. And I think that is the big issue we have faced, and I think we have done it very, very well. Now, the only point of contention between us that I can see-we will come back to the Japanese issue; you asked that and I have not forgotten-but the only-in Europe is that we have not agreed entirely on how to handle Bosnia, although we have done a lot of work together. The United States has spent almost $300 million in humanitarian assistance. We have strongly enforced and pushed for tougher sanctions and embargoes on Serbia. We believe and the Germans believe the arms embargo ought to be lifted on Bosnia. France and Britain and Russia disagree. I understand that. But that does not mean we cannot do anything together. We are trying to work together. And this, I think everyone would admit, is the most difficult international problem that we face. I am still hopeful that something humane, decent, and politically reasonable will emerge from this process before it is too late. But we all have a disagreement on that, and I am sorry we do. But we cannot agree on everything. And this is a very difficult problem. I still think I was right about what was the best course. I think events subsequent to the Athens meeting prove that beyond question. But nonetheless, I do not think that is a reason for us to give up on the European alliance, give up on NATO, give up on the G-7. This is a tough problem. With regard to Japan, I think everyone who has looked at the problem seriously thought there would have to be some realignment in our trade relations. And I think we are going to work that out. But there are lots of other things we have in common. Japan has supported the United States, and the United States has supported Japan in the things we have done to support democracy all over the world. Our security relationship is very strong. I intend to reaffirm my commitment to that when I am in Japan, and my commitment to Korea and to Asia generally when I am in Korea. So I think a lot of this-let me-if I might, a lot of this uncertainty in Europe, particularly, is a function of two things. One is the economic problems that we all have which make people always just more insecure. And two is, I have only been ENTITY 5 months. And we have a new Government in France. We have a new Government in Italy. We have a new Government in Canada. And so a lot of these folks, we do not all know each other. And I think when people do not know each other, there is always a-but you are trying to get to know one another-there is the temptation to take whatever incident is in the moment and reach some huge encyclopedia of meaning in it, which may or may not be accurate. So I think a lot of these things that you are talking about will be taken care of by meetings like this, by trips like this, and by constant working together. I will say-but every opportunity I have had to work with the other European leaders has been satisfactory. I had good cooperation between the United States and Italy, for example, when we were trying to reinforce the security of the U.N. forces within Bosnia, because the U.S. is committed to defend them if they are attacked, and everybody knows that. So I am just a lot more hopeful about this than I think some are. I think a lot of this is just a function of economic difficulties and new players who do not really know each other thoroughly yet. ENTITY, if I may go back to trade, I would like to know what do you say to the French, who have decided that they will not sign anything regarding GATT at the Tokyo summit up until the United States lifted or the Department of Commerce lifted the sanctions of steel, and we insisted that the United States accept the principle of multilateral mechanism to solve commercial conflicts. Well, those are two different issues. First of all, the action that was taken on steel was taken after a lot of deliberation, most of which was done before I became ENTITY, subsequent to United States law, which is clearly GAIT-consistent. So, I think, you know, if the belief is that the United States has been wrong on the facts, then we can discuss the facts. But there is nothing wrong with our law, and it is not that different from the laws of a lot of other countries that are part of the world trading system. Secondly, with regard to the trading mechanism, I have no problem with a multilateral mechanism to enforce trading agreements. But the GATT clearly contemplates that every country in the world, including France, should have the right to act in its own interest if the international system breaks down, which is not to say that you lose some rulings. But if there is no resolution of a crisis, the international system breaks down. All our Section 301 trade law does is to provide for some ultimate reservoir of authority for the United States to act unilaterally if the system itself breaks down. If France, for example, would like to propose a stronger multilateral decisionmaking process as a part of GATT before any country could act on its own, I would be more than happy to discuss that. I do not see this Section 301 as giving the United States the authority, for example, to decide on its own about all these trade agreements and how they affect us without regard to what other countries want to do. That is not at all the way it is supposed to operate. It is supposed to operate only against countries that are not part of trading agreements at all, so we do not have a trade-countries with whom we have no multilateral agreements, or when there is a total breakdown of the GATT system in this case. ENTITY, you raised today for the first time, I think, the question and the very important question of the structural impediments to growth. And so far you have and your Government has somehow created the impression that Europe and the difficulties in creating jobs should be loaded at the doorsteps of the Bundesbank. And yesterday you even said, Well, this is a contribution to global growth. And you raised the expectation and the-that it was just a cyclical problem. Now, why did not you come out before with this very strong statement that you are looking for structural impediments, that the G-7 should concentrate on doing away with structural barriers instead of pushing all the time the micro question-the macro question, excuse me? Well, first let me say that I have not criticized Germany in the past, but I have complimented them when the Bundesbank has lowered interest rates. But maybe for different reasons. And I know that because I realize that, first of all, all nations with independent central banks-and the United States has one, too; that is, the Federal Reserve-independent of the-all nations that have independent central banks are very sensitive about political leaders from within the nation telling them what to do and even more sensitive to suggestions from political leaders outside the nation's borders. And so what I have attempted to do is to say repeatedly, ever since I became ENTITY, that I thought that the extent to which we could coordinate the economic policies with Germany and the rest of Europe, and Japan, that that was a good thing. Coordinated economic policies for growth, and expanded trade, and smarter internal, microeconomic policies were all necessary to create jobs and growth in the world. And when Germany-when the interest rates were lower a couple of days ago, I did applaud that because I think it makes a contribution to growth. But I think-and the only reason that I-and I have done it not to be presumptuous but only to say that the United States was asked for years by its allies to deal with our budget deficit. We are now doing that, and we are getting the results that we hoped we would. We have a 20 year low in long-term interest rates, in home mortgage rates. We have had a 6 year high in housing sales. It is tailing off a little now but good housing sales. We have created more construction jobs in the first 4 mouths of this year than in any similar period for 9 years. And the point I am trying to make here is that there is a limit to what we can do for ourselves, and therefore what we can do for Europe and Japan in terms of buying more of your exports, unless all of us work together to promote growth. And obviously, because of the sheer size of the German economy and the power of Germany as an exporter, the condition of the German economy is critical to what happens to Americans. And you have had a very open trading philosophy. So I thought it was a positive thing, and I thought I should compliment it. But I think it is a delicate thing to talk about, because all of us who have ever suffered from runaway inflation have appreciated some measure of independence in our central banks. And yet all of us know that if the central banks are entirely insensitive to the economic growth needs of the country, we cannot coordinate the strategy. So it is a delicate matter. And I do not wish to be seen as interfering, but I think when a bank does something that is clearly a plus for the German people and for all the rest of the world, it is not wrong for ENTITY to compliment it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 65, "text": "Thank you, ENTITY. Great to see you, ENTITY. Nice to see you. I will with health care. It''s probably the most quoted thing or requoted thing you have said in your presidency, If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. You said it a lot during the run-up. At this point, though, it''s obviously something - a promise that has not been able to be kept. Just today the Denver Post reported 250,000 people in Colorado are seeing health insurance policies cancelled. Some of those people like those policies, and they can''t keep them. What happened? Well, first of all, I meant what I said. And we worked hard to try to make sure that we implemented it properly. But obviously, we didn''t do enough - a good enough job, and I regret that. We''re talking about 5 percent of the population who are in what''s called the individual market. They''re out there buying health insurance on their own. A lot of these plans are subpar plans. And we put in a clause in the law that said, if you had one of those plans, even if it was subpar, when the law was passed, you could keep it. But there''s enough churn in the market that folks since then have bought subpar plans. And now that may be all they can afford. So even though it only affects a small amount of the population, you know, it means a lot to them, obviously, when they get - this letter cancelled. And - you know, I am deeply concerned about it. And I''ve assigned my team to see what we can do to close some of the holes and gaps in the law - because, you know, my intention is to lift up and make sure the insurance that people buy is effective, that it''s actually going to deliver what they think they''re purchasing because what we know is, before the law was passed, a lot of these plans, people thought they had insurance coverage, and then they''d find out that they had huge out-of-pocket expenses or women were being charged more than men. If you had pre-existing conditions, you just couldn''t get it at all. And we are proud of the consumer protections we put into place. On the other hand, we also want to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled; they can''t afford a better plan, even though they''d like to have a better plan. And so we''re going to have to work hard to make sure that those folks are, you know, taken care of. Do you feel like you owe these folks an apology for misleading them - You know - - even if you didn''t intentionally do it? But at this point, they feel misled. And you''ve seen the anger that''s out there. You know, I regret very much that what we intended to do, which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans because they want them, as opposed to because they''re forced into it - that, you know, we weren''t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place. And I want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in a good position - a better position than they were before this law happened. Keep in mind that most of the folks who are going to - who got these cancellation letters, they''ll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces, because they''ll have more choice, they''ll have more competition, they''re part of a bigger pool. Insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business. So the majority of folks will end up being better off. Of course, because the website''s not working right, they don''t necessarily know it, right? But even though it''s a small percentage of folks who may be disadvantaged, you know, it means a lot to them and it''s scary to them. And I am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me. We''ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and that we''re going do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this. You''ve been getting some tough criticism on this quote: Clarence Page, your hometown newspaper, Chicago Tribune. This is not a - not a columnist who likes to throw bombs inside this White House, usually pretty supportive of what you said. He characterized this as a political lie. He called it a sort of - the sort of rosy promise politicians sometimes make with such passion and confidence that they actually even themselves that it is true. Is that the position you found? Did politics play a role and you felt as if, as the Republicans were throwing stuff at the law, you''re trying to pass it, you''re trying to do this, that you shorthanded this? No, I - I think we, in good faith, have been trying to take on a health care system that has been broken for a very long time. And what we''ve been trying to do is to change it in the least disruptive way possible. I mean, keep in mind that there were folks on the left who would have preferred a single payer plan. That would have been a lot more disruptive. There were folks on the right who said let''s just get rid of, you know, employer deductions for health care and give people a - a tax credit and they can go buy their own health care in their own market . That would have been more disruptive. We tried to find a proven model, we''ve seen it work in Massachusetts, that would be as - as undisruptive as possible and, in good faith, tried to write the law in such a way that people could keep their care, although we really believe that ultimately they''re going to be better off when they''re buying health care through the marketplaces. They can access tax credits and they''re benefiting from more choice and competition. But obviously, we didn''t do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law. And you know, that''s something that I regret. That''s something that we''re going do everything we can to get fixed. In the meantime - By the way, that sounds like you''re supportive of this legislation, the various things that are out there - Well, we''re - we''re looking at a - a range of options. But the one thing I want to emphasize though, ENTITY, is everybody is acting as if the existing market was working. And the fact of the matter is that a whole lot of people who are in this individual market, who were buying health care on their own because they were not getting it through their employer - they might be happy with it this year, and then suddenly next year the cost got jacked up by 15, 20 percent. The average increase on premiums in this individual market for somebody who kept their health care for a while - the average increase was double digits. If they actually got sick and used the insurance, they might find the next year their premiums had gone up, or the insurers might have dropped them altogether because now they had a pre-existing condition. Women were being charged as much as double compared to men. So this is a market that wasn''t working, and a whole lot of people were dissatisfied. And what we''ve done is to increase the consumer protections that are in place for those families and those folks. We''ve said you can''t drop people when they get sick and need it most. We''ve said that you can''t, you know, have lifetime limits so that suddenly people think they''ve gotten insurance; the next thing they know, they''ve got $30,000, $40,000 out-of-pocket expenses. And over the long term, that is the right thing to do. But in this transition, you know, there are going to be folks who get a cancelation letter. Especially when a website''s not working, they''re looking at saying, well, what am I going to do now? And you know, we have to make sure that they are not feeling as if they''ve been betrayed by an effort that is designed to help them. Do you feel like, considering how much this has been - it''s late night, it''s all sorts of things - that - do you understand if people are going to be skeptical of the next promise you make, of the next - or are you concerned that people are going to be wondering, jeez, what''s the fine print that he''s not telling me? Do you get that people might be a little more skeptical? Forget the partisans here in Washington. Just average Americans. You know, I''ll tell you, ENTITY. I - I think that - I''ve now been in national public life for seven, eight years. I''ve been ENTITY for almost five. And I think for the most part, people know that I speak my mind and I tell folks what I think, and I''ve been very clear about what I''m trying to do. And I think most people know that - even if they disagree with me on certain issues - that I''m every day working hard to try to make life a little bit better for middle-class families who are - and folks who are trying to get in the middle-class, who are doing the right thing and being responsible. I think what most people, I hope, also recognize is that when you try to do something big, like make our health care system better, that there are going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you''re doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off. And I hope that people will look at the end product and they''re going to be able to look back and say, you know what? We now have protections that we didn''t have before. We''ve got more choice and competition. I didn''t have health insurance; I now have it. I had bad health insurance; I now have good health insurance. The website''s actually working. I''m getting - Well, I want to get to the website. I''m getting - you know, I''m getting - Right. - you know, my kid on my insurance plan even though he''s got asthma or some other pre-existing condition. So ultimately I think I''ll be judged on whether this thing is better for people overall. And in the meantime, even if it''s a small percentage of people - I mean, we''re talking about 5 percent of the population - Which is millions? - but - but that''s a significant number of people. Yeah. Even though a whole lot of them are going to be better off, there''s going to be a segment who, you know, I''ve ultimately got to make sure that, you know, I''m speaking to their needs and their concerns. And, you know, I take that very seriously, because I want everybody out there to know that, you know, my entire intention here is to make sure that people have the security of affordable health care. You have 21 days till November 30th. Yes. Is this website going to be running smoothly enough - if it''s not, at that point, do you sit there and say, OK, let''s extend the enrollment period, let''s delay the mandate? Do all of those plan Bs start coming into focus if November 30th isn''t hit? Well, let me just say generally - and I don''t think I''m saying anything that people don''t know and I haven''t said before - I am deeply frustrated about how this website has not worked over the first couple of weeks, and, you know, I take responsibility of that, my team takes responsibility of that, and we are working every single day, 24/7, to improve it. And it''s better now than it was last week, and it''s certainly a lot better than it was on October 1st. I am confident that it will be even better by November 30th and that the majority of people are going to be able to get on there, they''re going to able to enroll, they''re going to be able to apply, and they''re going to get a good deal - a better deal than they''ve got right now when it comes to buying health insurance. Now, that - you know, having said that - given that I''ve been burned already with a website - well, more importantly, the American people have been burned by a website that has been dysfunctional, what we''ve also been doing is creating a whole other set of tracks, making sure that people can apply by phone effectively, making sure that people can apply in-person effectively - so what I''m confident about is that anybody who wants to buy health insurance through the marketplace, they are going to be able to buy it. And - So no delays? You have no plans, or you might - - Well, keep in mind - keep in mind that the open enrollment period - the period during which you can buy health insurance - is available all the way until March 31st, and we''re only five weeks into it. So we''ve got a whole bunch of time not only to get the website fixed, to work out all the kinks, to make sure that everybody has the information that they need. And what we''ll do is continue to assess. If there are roadblocks for people, we''re going to clear out those roadblocks. We are going to make sure that they can access - So you''re open to whatever it takes? Whatever it takes for people to be able to get what is good-quality health insurance at cheaper prices or better insurance for the same price as bad insurance that they''ve got right now. We''re going to make sure that they have access to that market. Still have full confidence in Kathleen Sebelius? You know, I think Kathleen Sebelius, under tremendously difficult circumstances under the last 4 1/2 years, has done a great job in setting up the insurance markets so that there is a good product out there for people to get. You know, Kathleen Sebelius doesn''t write code. You know, she wasn''t our IT person. I think she''d be the first to admit that if we had to do it all over again that there would have been a whole lot more questions that were asked in terms of how this thing is working. But my priority right now is to get it fixed. And you know, ultimately, the buck - She''s still the right person to do it? Ultimately, the buck stops with me. You know, I''m the ENTITY. This is my team. If it''s not working, it''s my job to get it fixed. I want to talk about a larger question here. We''ve discussed the website issue, but there seems to be this growing perception - and some of it is via press reports; some of it''s your staff - that you''re not always on top of some things, or this idea that you didn''t know certain things. So for instance, we talked about the website; did the warnings get to your desk or not? NSA - did you - did you really not know we were tapping Angela Merkel''s phone until Edward Snowden leaked it? Well, look, these are two different issues. First of all, I can guarantee you that I''ve been more deeply involved in our intelligence operations on a whole set of a whole set of areas where there are real threats against us than just about any president - or let me put it this way, as much as any president. When I am presented intelligence, particularly if it pertains to allies like Germany, I''m not poking and probing about where we get certain information. You didn''t know this - you didn''t know this until after you learned it? The - if we''re talking about al-Qaida, if we''re talking about, you know, other states that pose a threat to the United States, then not only am I interested in the information but also how we obtained it, because that''s very relevant. There''s no doubt when it comes to the NSA generally that over the last, you know, 30, 40, 50 years we have tried to extend our intelligence capabilities all around the world. That''s what every intelligence agency does. What''s changed is technology. What''s changed is capacity. We''re just so much better than anybody else at this. And technology has given us so much more reach than in the past - All right, because I''m getting the wrap sign. I want to sneak in two more - Don''t worry. OK. Don''t worry, I''ll give you two other questions. All good. Thank you, sir. All right. You know, one of the lessons learned from this whole process on the website is that probably the biggest gap between the private sector and the federal government is when it comes to IT - how we precure - procure it, how we purchase it. This has been true on a whole range of projects. And you know what your supporters say? You had a great campaign website. I know. How did you - how did you not be able to do this? Right. Well, the reason is, is that when it comes to my campaign, I''m not constrained by a bunch of federal procurement rules, right? And how we write specifications and - and how the - the whole thing gets built out. So part of what I''m gonna be looking at is, how do we across the board, across the federal government, leap into the 21st century? Because when it comes to medical records for veterans, it''s still done in paper. Medicaid is still largely done on paper. When we buy IT services, generally it is so bureaucratic and so cumbersome that a whole bunch of it doesn''t work, or it ends up being way over cost. And you know, in some ways, I should have anticipated that just because this was important and I was saying this was my top priority and I was meeting with folks once a month telling them, make sure this works, understanding that you had some structural problems there - you know, that''s on me. That''s something that I''ve got to refocus on. And I actually think that once we get this particular website fixed, there are going to be some lessons learned that we can apply to the federal government generally. All right. Let me take advantage of those two more questions. High-level negotiations on easing sanctions against Iran start tomorrow, essentially this - or they''ve been going on, but there are some more talks tomorrow. Are you so sure you''re going to be able to trust the Iranians on some sort of temporary deal? Or how is it that you''re going to figure out if you trust them or not? What''s your measurement? Well, first of all, our job is not to trust the Iranians. Our job is to put in place mechanisms where we can verify what they''re doing and not doing when it comes to their nuclear program. and the negotiations taking place are not about easing sanctions. The negotiations taking place are about how Iran begins to meet its international obligations and provides assurances not just to us but to the entire world that they are not - So no sanctions get changed until they do something? - that they are not developing nuclear weapons, that their nuclear energy program is peaceful. And frankly, because of actions in the past, the world doesn''t trust them on that. That''s why we''re able to construct these sanctions that have squeezed them very hard. Our job now is to test how serious they are about resolving this conflict or this dispute through peaceful means, through diplomacy. And there is a possibility of a phased agreement in which the first phase would be us, you know, halting any advances on their nuclear program, rolling some potential back, and putting in place a way where we can provide them some very modest relief, but keeping the sanctions architecture in place, keeping the core sanctions in place, so that if it turned out, during the course of the six months when we''re trying to resolve some of these bigger issues, that they''re backing out of the deal, they''re not following through on it or they''re not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they''re not developing a nuclear weapon, we can crank that dial back up. So we don''t have to trust them. What we have to do is to make sure that there is a good deal in place from the perspective of us verifying what they''re doing and that they''re actually moving in the right direction. We can test it. We don''t have to dismantle sanctions to do it. If, in fact, that proves to be a possibility, then it''s greatly preferable to us ratcheting up that conflict higher and higher, which ultimately might lead to some sort of confrontation. And I''ve said that I won''t take any options off the table, including military options, to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But the best way to assure ourselves that Iran''s not getting a nuclear weapon is if we''ve got a verifiable means that they have decided themselves and are dismantling that program and international organizations can see what they''re doing and we can see what they''re doing. Last question. Did you really not know that your campaign was researching this idea of swapping Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton? You know, again, ENTITY, the - the problem that we''ve got - and this goes back to the earlier question you asked - you know, I am in charge of 2 million people in the federal government, and that was true, by the way, even when I was running for ENTITY. So people do all kinds of stuff. Some of it they clear with me. Sometimes they''re trying to figure something out, particularly on the political side, and I''m not somebody who delves into polling and all that data. Here''s the one thing I can say for certain: that if they had asked me, I would have said there is no way that I''m not running again with Joe Biden, because I genuinely believe that he has been one of THE best vice presidents in our history. He also happens to be a friend. He also happens to be one of my most important advisers on domestic and foreign policy. I like him. When my back''s up against the wall, he has my back. And - Must have been upset, then, when this leaked out. You know, I''ve now been in this town long enough to know that, you know, folks like to seem important by getting their version of events in the press or books or what have you, and you know, that''s just kind of part of the atmosphere that you live in. Did you and the vice president talk? Absolutely. And - and I - what I told him - and he knows and he believes me - is that I would not - I would not be here if it weren''t for the support that I''ve had from Joe Biden. He - he is a personal friend and adviser. It''s one of the best decisions that I''ve ever made, was selecting him as vice president. I couldn''t be prouder of the job that he''s done. All right.

{"id": 141, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for receiving us at the White House, just a week before your meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev. I am Claude Smadja, from the Suisse Television. Let me introduce my colleagues: Martin Bell, from the BBC; Giuseppe Lugato, from RAI; Dieter Kronzucker, from ZDF; and Jacques Abouchar, from AN-2. ENTITY, 1 week before the summit in Geneva, the prospects seem quite bleak. Do you still expect to strike a deal in Geneva, and, in fact, are you going to strike a deal in Geneva? Well, I am not as pessimistic as that. I understand, of course, that it is not going to be easy. There is a long history of meetings between our two countries and, many times, without much result. But I am going to make every effort to try and reduce the mistrust and suspicion that seems to exist between our-well, not only our two nations but sort of the East and the West. And I believe there are possibilities. We are going to try to deal in some four areas-arms control, of course, is one; the regional disputes that are going on in the world and where the major powers are involved. Bilateral issues, a number of kind, that are between us probably would be the easiest thing that we will face in those meetings. And we will just carry on, see what we can do. ENTITY, I wonder, on arms control, are you going with a set negotiating position-some counterproposals to Mr. Gorbachev's proposals-and is your team of advisers finally united behind you? Yes, we are united, and I think that there is been some distortion as to whether we were not . In our government here, I solicit and encourage varying opinions and ideas. I think it helps to make a decision when I hear all viewpoints. But I do not envision this meeting as being one where we will get down to specific numbers and so forth. We have a team of negotiators, each side, in Geneva that have been negotiating on the possibility of nuclear arms reductions for some time. We have had a proposal on the table in those talks for a considerable period of time, and finally, the Soviet Union came back with a counterproposal. And we have now offered a counter to that. We found encouragement in their counterproposal; there were numbers that we could agree with. And so, the proposal that we have made in response is one that kind of compromises between our original proposal and theirs, accepting some of their figures-in fact, some of the main figures on basic numbers and so forth-and then, our view on some of the complex issues about the mix of weapons and so forth. And to me, this is legitimate negotiations. But I would think what we should be dealing with at the summit is, as I said earlier, the elimination of suspicion and mistrust to the point that we could turn the specific numbers over to those other negotiators, but that they could have a signal from both sides, from their government and ours from us, have a knowledge that we want them to continue and to arrive at an agreement. ENTITY, over the last few days and even now here, you continue to sound optimistic about the summit in Geneva, though we know now there will be no substantial agreement, there will be no arms agenda, and even, probably, there would be no joint communique. Now, what would it be-just a get-acquaintance meeting? And in this case, even the atmosphere, I think it is a bit strange, considering the last occurrences. So, what is the reason of your optimism? Oh, no, I do not think this is just a get-acquainted meeting, important though that may be. But I think there are many areas for agreement here. And as I say, I am not pessimistic about them. Look at the one situation that has both of us continuing to build these arsenals of weapons. The Soviet Union claims that they fear that we mean harm to them, that somehow we are nursing a plan of invading them or attempting to change their system. On the other hand, we believe, and I think with some evidence, that their policy has been expansionist; that is evidenced by Afghanistan, Ethiopia, South Yemen, Angola. And I think that if we sit and face each other and lay our cards on the table as to the fact that they do not like us or our system and we do not like theirs. But we are not going to try to change theirs, and they better not try to change ours. But we have to live in the world together. And we are the only two countries that probably could start world war III. We are also the two countries that could prevent world war III from happening. And I think that a little common sense should make us find out that we can continue to be competitive in the world, but in a peaceful way and without the threat of annihilation hanging over the world as it does now. ENTITY, scientific results show up to now that your space defense shield is not as impenetrable as originally thought. Does this make SDI more of a bargaining chip? Could you compromise on this system? Not compromise in the sense of giving up on the research. Now, the truth of the matter is there've been some breakthroughs that have a number of scientists quite optimistic about this research, and since this research is all going on within the bounds of the ABM treaty, we are going to continue, because I think it would be the greatest thing in this century if we could come up with the idea that, at last, there is a defensive measure, a system against nuclear missiles. Nuclear missiles-these are the only weapons in the history of man that have not given birth, so far, to a defense against them, but this, as I say, would be the greatest thing for peace. If we could switch from a setup today in which peace is maintained on the basis that we can destroy each other, totally offensive weapons, each with a great arsenal and the threat that, well, if one starts, the other will retaliate. Does not it make much more sense if we could come up with a defensive system and then sit down with all the nuclear powers in the world and say, Look, let us get to less of an offensive nature and let us take up the idea of reassurance for ourselves on a basis of defensive systems, not offensive weapons ? And so, this is not a bargaining chip in that sense-of being willing to trade off the research and stop what we are doing in order to get x number of missiles eliminated; we will continue with that. Then, as I have said many times, I think if the research, and when the research, would show that such a weapon is practical, then, before deployment, I think we sit down together and decide how we use this to bring about the elimination of nuclear weapons, offensive weapons, and to make the world safer. ENTITY, you have described Mr. Gorbachev as a formidable opponent. Did his Paris meeting with the French President give you a new light on the Soviet leader's personality and did that change your approach of the summit in any way? Well, no, but some of our own people, now, have met with Mr. Gorbachev. Unfortunately, President Mitterrand could not be at the U.N. meeting, where I managed to meet with the heads of state of our other economic summit allies. And so, I heard secondhand, however, from some of them who had had an opportunity and then from Margaret Thatcher and then, as I say, with our own people who've met with him. I recognize all they say. On the other hand, I just told our people this morning that there will be another first in these meetings. It will be the first time we have ever had someone on our side of the table who is older than the fellow on the other side of the table. So, maybe I can help this young man with some fatherly advice. ENTITY, you have set regional conflict high on the agenda. What will be your approach to Mr. Gorbachev on this regional conflict? The substance of your talk will be enough is enough? Will it be kind of fist-on-the-table approach to Mr. Gorbachev? Well, I believe if we are going to eliminate or reduce the tensions or the mistrust between us, it is going to have to be by deeds rather than words. And I enunciated what I believe about the regional things in my speech to the United Nations, that here are these conflicts, people are being killed, such as is going on in Afghanistan. And it is true that there is a government in Afghanistan that is on the side of the Soviet Union. It also is true that the Soviet Union installed that government there; it was not chosen by the people of Afghanistan. Now, my thought is that if we can take these up as examples of the expansionism that I mentioned and see if we together, these two great powers together, cannot withdraw foreign forces and then help and perhaps get international custodial forces while they settle peacefully the dispute within each one of these regions. This is what we have been trying to do in Nicaragua, where, again, the Soviet Union is-no question-they are involved with advisers, trainers, and great amounts of weaponry, more than any Central American country needs for its own defense. So, you have to believe that they, too, are looking toward spreading beyond their borders this totalitarianism. But we have urged the contras and the Sandinista government of Nicaragua to come together, lay down their weapons, declare a truce and come together, and then, we suggested there the church overall supervise or mediate while they seek to settle their differences without further bloodshed. So far the contras have agreed. The Sandinista government is the-and so has the church-the Sandinista government has said no. But this is the type of thing that we think should be the answer to these regional problems, not only out of humanitarianism and a desire to see people be able to live peacefully in their countries but because those regional conflicts run the risk of spreading and leading to confrontation between major powers. ENTITY, Mrs. Thatcher described you last night as our champion; that is, you are going in to bat at Geneva for the Europeans as well as the Americans. Is that so, and what can you do for us? Well, I think the world is pretty much divided right now, certainly Europe and our own hemisphere here between East and West and the NATO alliance-that NATO line does seem to be a dividing line between that and the Warsaw Pact, and there is no way that I could go there and deal with the subjects before us without having in mind the best interests of our allies also, because in the event of catastrophe they are there on the front line, they would be the first to feel that. So, yes, I expect to have their interests very much in mind. Sir, this is in a way a followup on Martin Bell's question. I should say that the Europeans have a great nostalgia of detente, and what is your message to them at the eve of Geneva, and what is your vision of a new detente? Limits also? If it is a real detente, if it is based on the elimination or reduction of the suspicions that now exist-but in the past, under the guise of detente, we saw the Soviet Union engage in the greatest military buildup in world history and at the same time that we were supposed to be talking as if we had friendly relations and had achieved some kind of a detente. And what was really, finally, going on was an arms race, because when they achieved an imbalance so great that we felt our own security was threatened, we had to get into the arms race. I have often told of a cartoon that appeared in one of our papers when we started our refurbishing of our military power. And it was a cartoon of two Soviet generals, and one was saying to the other, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. And I know that Mr. Brezhnev at one point, to his own people, publicly made the statement that through detente they had gained enough that they would soon, shortly, be able to have their way and work their will throughout the world. Well, that is not really detente. ENTITY, if SDI is not negotiable at the moment, so there might be no compromise also on ballistic missiles, could you envision an understanding with Mr. Gorbachev in the area of theater nuclear weapons already in Geneva? Well, yes, as you say, this is already in Geneva. And this is definitely one of the topics we will take up there at the summit. As you know, our original proposal was-we were willing to cancel all of them. The Soviets were sitting with SS-20's in great numbers, multiple-warhead missiles targeted on Europe. And Europe had asked us-before my arrival here-had asked my predecessor for weapons to counter those. And the agreement was made that we would. And I inherited the job when I got in here of providing those weapons. They had not yet been delivered. We at no time ever were delivering an equal number of what the Soviets had, but we did propose zero-zero. And on that case, the Soviets met us halfway-zero for us and they'd continue to have their SS-20's. But, yes, we would like to see that, as we are negotiating in Geneva, as treated separately from the intercontinental ballistic missiles, the strategic weapons, to see if we could not eliminate those medium-range weapons that could target each other in a matter of just a few minutes. So, you should be closer in this area? Well, I know that the Soviets have talked about such things as a nuclear-free zone in Europe. And we are willing to engage them, and will, in conversation on that kind of a subject. ENTITY, in the past, you have referred to the Soviet Union as an evil empire. Then, lately, you avoided the expression. Have you changed your opinion, or do you still consider that Gorbachev, U.S.S.R., is still a totalitarian regime? Well, it is a totalitarian regime. They do not see freedom for their people as the democracies do. But as I have said before, we are not trying to change their system internally. What I think it is necessary to do is to let them know that the democratic world is not going to hold still for their expansionism into other parts of the world and to our own countries. Yes, I used the term the evil empire. There've been some things that have gone on that-and yet I have a few quotes of my own that they have said; one in which they even called us cannibals. So, I think both of us have stopped that language, thinking that we will get farther at the meetings if we come together to try and eliminate the need for such talk. ENTITY, the summit of Geneva will be the first in 6 years, and you will have about 8 hours of discussion with Mr. Gorbachev, which is not so much. So, what kind of approach will you try on him? Will you try a kind of man-to-man approach to try to convince, to get your point? Yes. As a matter of fact, there are some meetings scheduled where it will just be one on one, the two of us. And I will do my utmost, with the evidence at hand, to prove to them that if he does nurse any suspicion that we mean him harm-I think the presentation of some facts such as at the end of World War II, when we were the only nation whose industry and capacity had not been bombed to rubble, when we were the only ones with the nuclear weapon, we could have been pretty dictatorial, ourselves, in the world. But we were not ; we did not do that-and then point out to him how we see their expansionist policies and so forth and see if we cannot come together and recognize that this-when I said deeds, this is how we can eliminate the suspicion. I think the theme that I will take was cited by someone-the line is not original with me-who said that nations do not distrust each other because they are armed, they are armed because they distrust each other. So, we will see if we cannot work on that last half. ENTITY, this is obviously the most important meeting of your Presidency. You are up against a very formidable figure. I wonder, are you nervous at all? Not really, no. Maybe I am relying on past experience. Long before I ever thought I would be in public life in this way-for about 20 years, I did the negotiating for the union of which I was ENTITY for 6 of those 20 years, our contract negotiations, repeatedly, with management. I am the first ENTITY who was ever president of a labor union. And I think I know something about negotiating, and I intend to go at it in the same manner. ENTITY, do you really want an agreement with the Soviets, and considering the situation and the differences, the gap between the two systems, what kind of an agreement do you want? On what basis? Naturally, this is in perspective, not only Geneva. Let us see Geneva as the starting point. Well, an overall agreement that we do understand the positions that we are in as the two so-called superpowers and that we have a great responsibility to maintain peace in the world and that it does not mean that we interfere with each other's internal policies at all, but that we agree to exist in the world and compete peacefully. And that is the overall tone I think that should come out of the summit. But as I say, it cannot just be based on each of us making a promise and saying we feel that way. There have to be some things done, some deeds that really prove that we mean our words. ENTITY, do you already have a forward copy of the new book of Mr. Gorbachev, Time for Peace, which will come to the market this week? No, I do not have that. I will look forward to that. ENTITY, do you intend to meet Mr. Gorbachev regularly, maybe on an annual base? I think whether it is on an annual basis or back and forth and so forth, I think those are things to be settled at this summit. But I definitely think that a great measure of success would be if we came away from this meeting with a decision that we were going to continue meeting and discussing the problems between us. ENTITY, it has been said that there will be no final communique, but will you bet, at least, on a set of guidelines to give a new impetus to the arms talk? Yes, I am not a great fan of communiques, the sort of settling on a statement in advance. And I know we discussed this with them. I think that it'd make far more sense if each one of us came forth and gave our own view of the meetings and what had been achieved, told frankly what had been accomplished and what had not . I have agreed with the heads of state of our NATO allies that on the day that we leave Geneva to come home, I am going by way of Brussels, and if they will be there, I am going to give a briefing right then. And then, when I arrive here that night, I am going to go directly from the plane to the Congress and before a Joint Session of our Congress and on television to the people of the United States, report on the meetings. And I think that is a better thing to do. If there are things that we have not been able to agree on, let us be willing to say it, but say we will keep on trying-but not have a communique which all too often seems to want to gloss over the things that were not accomplished. So, how will we know whether you have failed or succeeded? Will it be whether you have managed to set up another meeting? Well, I think it'll be on the basis of when I report, judgment of the outcome of the things that I will specify that were done or the things that were left undone or the things, then, that we have agreed to go on talking about. Sir, apparently, according to several reports, Mr. Shultz came back from Moscow with quite a bad impression of Mr. Gorbachev. Do you share that opinion? Now, who did you say came away with the- Mr. Shultz Oh. -according to several reports No, no, as a matter of fact, he told me that they kind of went at it and that he was argumentative and interrupted at times. But then he said he, George Shultz, interrupted also and found out that it was not resented, that it was that kind of a free-for-all discussion. And he said that he was very set in his ways-or I mean, about his views on the aims of his country and so forth. And, well, we are very set on ours. ENTITY, in the second debate with the then-candidate of the Democrats, Mr. Mondale, you said that, even possibly, you would share the results of the scientific research on SDI with the Russians in order to make the world safer. Do you still consider in doing that, finally? Maybe I did not make it clear. That is what I meant in my earlier answer-not just share the scientific research with them. Let me give you my dream of what would happen. We have the weapon. We do not start deploying it. We get everybody together, and we say, Here, here it is. And here is how it works and what it'll do to incoming missiles. Now, we think that all of us who have nuclear weapons should agree that we are going to eliminate the nuclear weapons. But we will make available to everyone this weapon. I do not mean we will give it to them. They are going to have to pay for it--but at cost. But we would make this defensive weapon available. Now, some can say, Well, if you are going to do away with the nuclear offensive weapons, then, why does anyone need this? Well, because we all know how to make it. And someday there may be a madman in the world, as there have been before, who would start in secretly to produce these weapons. But it is like when in Geneva in 1925 all the nations of the world after World War I got rid of poison gas-everybody kept their gas masks. Well, the same thing-this is kind of the gas mask thing. We could say, Look, we will never, any of us, have to fear that maybe some one of us cheating or maybe there is going to be that madman someday if we all have the ability to defend ourselves against nuclear missiles. And I think this would make far more sense than for us to say, Oh, we found it. We will go ahead and deploy it now while we still keep our other missiles. The world would have a right to expect that maybe we were thinking first blow. And if the Soviets do not share that view, what will happen? I certainly do not believe that we could stand by and let them veto our use or implementation of a defensive weapon. ENTITY, what is your feeling when some of your allies, France, but not only France, are either reluctant or openly opposed to the SDI? What can you tell them? Well, I think there was some misunderstanding about it and where we were going with it. And I know in the meetings up at New York, at the U.N. opening this time, there was a great change on the part of a number of them when I explained what our view of this was. And so I think that there is not that great opposition to it. And a number of the countries where they, as governments, did not want to become involved, for whatever reasons they had, but would not object to their own scientists, their own private business firms and so forth, or industries getting involved and joining in with us in this research and development. ENTITY, on behalf of my colleagues here, I would like to thank you very much for granting us this interview and sharing your views just a week before your summit meeting in Geneva with the Soviet leader. Thank you very much, ENTITY Well, I am greatly honored that you all wanted to do this, and thank you very much. I appreciate it.

{"id": 272, "text": "Are you there, ENTITY? Hi, ENTITY. How are you? I will tell you what, are those two guys telling you the truth tonight? They are telling the truth Have you read the full book, ENTITY? I have read it. I read it twice, as a matter of fact. And? I think she did a terrific job. I want to thank Jim for all the work he did on it. And after Mother died, I had to do a little work just checking some of the facts, but I was amazed at how candid and forthright she was. And she turned out to be a right good storyteller. It is a terrific book. I think a lot of folks will really enjoy reading it, and we will see a portrait of a remarkable person during an important time in our country's life. I was really proud of her for doing it. Last time we were together, we spoke about your loss. Wasn't it difficult to read it? It was. Or the first time, before it was actually published in book form, it kind of helped me deal with the loss. But I tell you, it still makes me a little sad. Last week when I finished reading it the second time, I found myself fighting back the tears a little bit, but that is one of the things that makes the book so wonderful. I have even had total strangers come up to me and say that they cried when they read it, too. What was her most, ENTITY, remarkable aspect to you? I think her resilience. You know, she was just a person driven by love and loyalty and an incredible desire to keep living. And she could not be beaten down. I mean, she was widowed three times. When Dick asked her to marry him, she reminded him that she'd been widowed three times and asked him if he had considered odds of what he was trying to get into. But no matter what happened to her, she just bounced back. And I think that is probably the most important lesson she imparted to me and to my brother, just do not give up. They have discussed the difficulty of when Roger had his troubles and how she held up during that time, during your only defeat, how she held up during that time. Was she a strength source, was she a place most people figure their mothers as a safe place to go. Well, I think she really plainly was not only a safe place to go, but she really did always convince us that we could do better tomorrow. When I lost that race in 1980, I had the distinguished record of being at that time the youngest former Governor in the history of the entire United States. I was out of a job; I did not know where my next nickel was coming from. And within 3 or 4 days she decided that I could be reelected Governor. And when my brother had his drug problem, it was awful for her, much tougher, of course, than any election loss. And she, as she says in the book, had a lot to learn about drug addiction, about what those of us who were in the same family had done by not confronting my brother. And she finally came to understand, as Dick said earlier, that getting arrested and actually being forced to go to prison may well have saved my brother's life. And he is come back; he is made a good life; he is made a wonderful marriage; he is about to become a father. And I think a lot of that happened because my mother never quit believing in him and was brave enough to face the truth about what happened and then, at her age, was willing to learn whatever it took to learn to help get him over it and working him through it and do her part. And she sure would have had a good time touring for this book, would not she? Yes. I was thinking about that today. This thing would be a stomp-down bestseller if she'd lived, because she'd have had so much fun promoting it. She had a good time doing everything she did. She learned to be a politician rather late in life. You know, before I got in politics, she voted, but that was about it. And then by the time I'd been through a campaign or two, she was the best organized person I knew. She had 300 to 400 names on a file card in our hometown, and all the local politicians were half afraid of her. She just got into things, and her enthusiasm took over. I really regret that she is not stomping around the country selling this book and not on your program and not answering questions. Do you remember the night when you were running for office and you and Al Gore were on, and she called in from Vegas? Yes, I do. You asked her, Where are you? Vegas. Where she belonged. She loved Las Vegas, and she loved those race tracks. I know. One other thing, ENTITY. Everyone is complimenting you today on the eloquence yesterday at another tragic day in the lives of all Americans, the death of a President. Was that a difficult moment for you? Funerals are never easy. Was that particularly difficult? It was in some sense because, you know, the other people who were speaking, Secretary Kissinger and Senator Dole and Governor Wilson, they'd all played an important role in President Nixon's life. They'd been a part of his successes; they'd been part of his difficult times. And funerals are really a time for family and friends. But he was, after all, the President of this country. I am now-and it was an appropriate thing, I think, for me to do my best at his funeral. And I was deeply honored that his family asked me to speak. And it was difficult, but I hope I did right by him. I am very grateful to him for the incredibly wise counsel he gave me in the last 16 months. And frankly, just today I had a problem, and I said to the person who was working with me, I wish I could pick up the phone and call Richard Nixon and ask him what he thinks we ought to do about this. I bet there are times you wish you could call Virginia Kelley, too. Amazing number of times. When I came in from the trip I took to Europe and to Russia, right after she died, it was a Sunday evening, and almost without thinking I went right into the kitchen and got halfway to the phone before I realized that I could not call her on Sunday night. That is when I used to call and check in with Mother and Dick, see how they were doing. And it was almost like a shock. And a lot of people who lose a mother or a father or a husband or a wife will tell you that they find themselves almost talking out loud. I do that a lot. Just looking at your films here of Mother mean a lot to me. Thanks, ENTITY. Thanks for joining us. You guys have a good night. Thanks again, Jim, for all the wonderful work you did on this book. And tell the truth, Dick.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlarryking0", "title": "Interview With Larry King", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-larry-king-0", "publication_date": "28-04-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 403, "text": "Good Monday, everyone. Thanks for being here. Hope you had a nice weekend, hot as it was. Before I take your questions, let me tell you that on Thursday, June 6th, as part of his Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour, the President will travel to Mooresville Middle School in Mooresville, North Carolina to deliver remarks and experience firsthand the school's cutting-edge curriculum through digital learning. In his State of the Union address, the President laid out his belief that the middle class is the engine of economic growth in our country. To reignite that engine, there are three areas we need to invest in: jobs, skills, and opportunity. We need to build on the progress we have made over the last four years, and that means investing in those areas that are already creating good-paying, stable jobs that can support a middle-class family. With that, I will take your questions. Julie Pace. Thanks, ENTITY. I wanted to get the White House's response to what is happening in Turkey right now, particularly Erdogan questioning the legitimacy of the protestors in what seems to be an increased police reaction to those protests. Thank you for the question. We continue to follow the events in Turkey closely and with concern. As we stated from the outset last week, the United States supports full freedom of expression and assembly, including the right to peaceful protest, as fundamental to any democracy. We believe that the vast majority of the protestors have been peaceful, law-abiding, ordinary citizens exercising their rights. The United States has serious concerns about the reports of excessive use of force by police and large numbers of injuries and damage to property. We call on these events to be investigated and to urge all parties to refrain from provoking violence. Has the President spoken with Erdogan since these protests started? He has not. I have no calls to report. I refer you to the State Department for any outreach that they might have had with the Turks, but no calls from here to report. And just more broadly, given Turkey is important to so many of the issues that the U.S. deals with in that part of the world, how key is stability in Turkey to the President? Turkey is a very important ally. And look, all democracies have issues that they need to work through and we would expect the government to work through this in a way that respects the rights of their citizens. I think that we continue to work with Turkey on a range of issues -- as a NATO ally and as a key player in the region -- and we look forward to doing that. And just on a totally separate topic -- Darrell Issa over the weekend called you a paid liar for the administration. I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to his comment. I had not heard that. That is amazing. I am not going to get into a back and forth with Chairman Issa. I think that what our focus is and has been is the need to find out all the inappropriate activity that occurred; make sure, as the President insists, that those who are responsible for inappropriate, outrageous activity be held accountable; that processes are put into place at the IRS so that something like this cannot happen again. The President acted, as you know, in response to the independent Inspector General's report by making clear that he was outraged by the behavior; by acting quickly to install new leadership at the IRS; by instructing that new leadership to conduct a thorough review that would examine the behavior, hold those accountable who were responsible for it, and to examine the overall culture at the IRS to make sure that these kinds of things cannot happen again. I would note that when I spoke about the situation I was referring to the findings of the independent Inspector General, who -- let us be clear -- said that he both in testimony and in his report found no evidence that outsiders -- those outside the IRS -- influenced the behavior that took place there. That is the conclusion of the independent Inspector General, and we certainly have seen no other evidence to contradict that. However, the President is interested in getting all the facts, and that is why he has instructed that the new leadership at the IRS conduct this review. We are interested in legitimate congressional oversight. That is an important component in a situation like this to finding all the facts and making sure that remedial action is taken. And, as you know, there is a criminal investigation that is being undertaken by the Department of Justice. So I think there is ample demonstration of this administration's interest in getting all the facts and holding those who are responsible accountable. To follow up on Turkey, does the unrest in Turkey make it harder to deal with the Syria situation? Well, we work very closely with Turkey on the situation in Syria, with our allies and partners in the region, and we will continue to do that. I believe, as I said, that the -- we expect and we believe that the Turkish government will appropriately work through this situation. We call on the events that occurred to be investigated and urge all parties to refrain from provoking violence. And we think that the right of free expression and assembly, those rights are fundamental to democracy. And we have concerns about some of the response, but we certainly expect the Turkish government to work through this. There was a story in the paper over the weekend saying there was some displeasure inside the White House with Eric Holder. Does the President feel like Eric Holder is becoming a distraction? It is important to note that, I believe in the article you are referring to, the Chief of Staff was quoted on the record, and in that statement he spoke for the President and he spoke for all of us. And he said that, The President and his team at the White House believe that the Attorney General has the intellect, experience, and integrity to efficiently run the Department of Justice and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the American people. And I think I could not say it any better, so I quoted the Chief of Staff saying it. Just to button down the Issa thing, finally -- they point specifically to two instances in the briefing where you said on May 21st, referred to apparent conduct by our IRS officials in Cincinnati; and on May 20th, line IRS employees in Cincinnati improperly scrutinized 501- organizations. When you made those statements -- Those are the findings of the audit conducted by the independent Inspector General, correct? Those are the findings, right? I was citing -- and perhaps there are issues that the Chairman has with the IG. I was citing the findings of the independent Inspector General. As you recall, we waited for that report to be released before responding. The President responded I think with appropriate concern and took immediate action, and is continuing to direct those who are responsible for these matters to take action. Again, the Inspector General concluded in his report and testified to this before Congress that he found no evidence of outside influence on the behavior that was of such great concern to all of us at the IRS. It is also important to note the President has instructed the new acting commissioner of the IRS to conduct a review that looks at this activity; holds responsible those who were responsible for it -- holds accountable those who are responsible for it; and takes measures to ensure that it cannot happen again. Separately, we are cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight. Separately, the Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation. So I think it is important to stick to the facts, look at the work that has been done and build on it -- which is what this President wants to do, what the new acting commissioner wants to do, the Treasury Secretary wants to do. And we certainly hope that that is what the congressional oversight committees hope to do. Robert Gibbs, this morning, called on Darrell Issa to apologize to you. Do you expect or want an apology? And is this the kind of language you think is productive? I appreciate those who have spoken in my defense, but I would simply say that I am not interested in having a back and forth with Chairman Issa. I am interested in what the President is interested in, in this matter, which is that we take action to ensure that this activity does not happen again; we take action to hold accountable those who are responsible for it; we cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight; and we obviously cooperate with any investigation that the Department of Justice is undertaking. Those are the things that matter here. And, again, I do not want to get into a back and forth. And just finally, this weekend, David Plouffe sent out a Tweet that is pretty inflammatory in itself, bringing up old allegations against Darrell Issa. Is that the kind of back and forth that is actually productive, moving the agenda forward? I would simply say that I am not interested in that back and forth -- or having a back and forth with the Chairman. I, again, as I think we have just discussed, spoke very carefully and specifically about the findings of the independent Inspector General in his lengthy review of the conduct at the IRS. I spoke, in fact, quite clearly that we have seen no evidence that contradicts the findings of the independent Inspector General. I would point you to the testimony of the former IRS Commissioner that makes clear the lack of involvement of people outside of the IRS, to his knowledge and in his view. And, again, we have no information that would contradict that. The President's focus is on taking action to hold accountable those who are responsible for this behavior, taking action to ensure that it never happens again, because it is very important that the American people have faith that the IRS applies our tax laws fairly across the country. And that is why he was so outraged by the actions that were reported by the Inspector General, and that is why he has acted in response in the way that he has. So, ENTITY, on a different IRS subject -- has the President seen the IG report -- it was supposed to come out tomorrow -- which talks about waste at the IRS and it talks about, in fact, the IRS employees using presidential suites at conferences. Does the President think that is appropriate? No. Well, in answer to your question, we have not seen the report, but, no, he does not think that conduct is appropriate. I would point you to statements released by the acting IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, who says, This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era. Taxpayers should take comfort that a conference like this would not take place today. Sweeping new spending restrictions have been put place at the IRS, and travel and training expenses have dropped more than 80 percent since 2010, and similar large-scale meetings did not take place in 2011, 2012, or 2013. And, second, I would point out that the President has made creating an efficient and effective government a priority, a cornerstone of his administration. He believes that everyone in this administration must take their role as stewards of the taxpayer dollar very seriously. That is why in May of 2012 the administration outlined a series of actions for reining in spending and increasing both transparency and oversight of federal conference and travel activity. The federal government spending on travel, which includes conference activity, was reduced by more than $1 billion in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2010. On travel spending, agencies have lowered their spending on travel -- compared to FY 2010 levels -- by roughly $2 billion. The Department of Agriculture, for example, reduced travel costs by over $125 million. The Drug Enforcement Administration implemented mandatory policy guidance requiring employees to use lowest-available fares for air travel, and due to this policy alone, DEA achieved over $6.5 million in savings in fiscal year 2012. These are examples that illustrated a commitment the President has to wringing out waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars. And it is important to note that Danny Werfel, who is now the acting commissioner over at the IRS, oversaw that process at the OMB when he was at the OMB. How important is this to the White House, a report like this, because of the confidence that is needed in the IRS in order to perform its duties? It does not have enough agents to investigate all of us. It depends upon public trust. Are you concerned that public trust is, in fact, being hurt by both of these scandals? And especially, is, in fact, the IRS a broken agency at this time that needs a thorough review? The answer is the President is very concerned by the activity that has been reported by the independent Inspector General with regards to the targeting of conservative groups applying for tax exempt status. He is concerned by -- and has been -- excessive spending by the IRS and other agencies when it comes to conferences and travel, and has taken action accordingly. It is very important, and your question implies this, that the American people have faith that the IRS in particular is applying our tax laws in a fair and responsible way. And that is why he has ordered a review after installing new leadership at the IRS, and he expects that review to be unsparing and to hold accountable people who are responsible for inappropriate conduct. And we will also cooperate with congressional oversight, and we, of course, will cooperate with the Department of Justice's criminal investigation into this matter. But it is precisely because of the President's concern that he articulated right away after the IG report was released that these actions are being undertaken. Do you believe that Chairman Issa is contributing to trust in the IRS with his oversight by insisting he believes the orders to target conservative groups came out of Washington? Again, I do not want to get into a back and forth. We believe that there is an important role to be played by Congress through legitimate oversight. We take this matter very seriously, which is why the President has ordered the actions that he has ordered, and why the new acting commissioner of the IRS is proceeding with the review that this President and the Secretary of the Treasury committed him to perform. It is why we will cooperate with both congressional oversight and Justice Department investigations -- because this is a serious matter and it needs to be addressed. And that is our focus. And I think that when it comes to getting the facts, we need to get them and not make judgments before we have all the facts. And I think that that is why we made the decision to wait for the publication of the independent Inspector General's report. Even though the issue itself had become public and there was a great demand for comment on it, we believed it was the right thing to do not to comment on it before it was public because it would have been inappropriate in our view to in any way intervene in a process that was not complete. And that is what we did. And when that report became public, the President acted very quickly and he spoke very clearly about his outrage over this conduct. Is the Congress exercising legitimate oversight? Do you see legitimate oversight? Again, I am not going to get into a play-by-play or a review of congressional activity day by day, but I believe that congressional oversight -- we believe that congressional oversight is important when it is legitimate, and we think that this is a matter that should be looked at by Congress through the process of legitimate congressional oversight. But we think it is important to stay focused on what we know, what the facts are, the information we know from the report conducted by the independent Inspector General, and then to build on that through the review being overseen by the new commissioner at the IRS, through the congressional oversight role and through the investigation undertaken by the Department of Justice. On another subject -- can you comment on Ezra Klein's book indicating that the President has agreed to support his former Secretary of State in 2016? I confess that I was not aware of that report, but I will run out and buy the book or purchase it online. I can assure you the President is not thinking about the next presidential election, having just recently won the last one. Yes. If I could ask you quickly, ENTITY, about the -- considering the White House's fierce efforts to try to stop leaks in terms of national security secrets and the like, today, Bradley Manning's trial begins and I wanted to get a sense from you. His attorney said just a short time ago -- he described him as a young, nave, but well-intentioned man. What is the White House's perspective on Bradley Manning, given the fact that you guys are prosecuting this -- the administration is? Inherent in your question is the recognition that there is an ongoing trial, so I could not comment on an ongoing trial. I would refer you to the prosecutors in the Department of Justice on that matter. It is certainly our view -- broadly speaking, not referring to any specific case -- that leaks of national security -- sensitive national security information, classified information, can be very harmful to our national security interests. I want to ask you quickly about the comments we heard from the President a short time ago as part of this mental health conference taking place today. He said that the VA is partnering with 24 communities in nine states to help, among other things, reduce wait times, to provide better access to mental health care for veterans; that they have recently hired 1,600 mental health providers and there are going to be, I think, 150 summits that he referred to today. How is that going to be paid for? I would have to refer you to HHS and to the VA. I do not have that information for you. I think that mental health is an important issue that is often stigmatized. It is a component of our gun violence problem. That is why this conference was a piece of the executive action, a portion of the report that the Vice President put together and the President has acted on when it comes to reducing gun violence in America. But, obviously, it touches on a range of issues that -- not just limited to gun violence, but a range of issues. And then on that topic, is the White House concerned that furloughs that we have now learned are taking place already at Walter Reed, I think at Fort Belvoir, that 3,500 civil employees are going to be furloughed at those places? That accounts for like 94 percent at Walter Reed. Are you concerned about the impact that will have on services for veterans, including mental health? Well, I do not know enough about the specific breakdowns of the furloughs and the effects or impacts in different areas to say with any specificity about what harm might be done. It is certainly the case that the furloughs caused by sequester are having effects across the country -- real consequences for real people. We have seen it in reports about the elimination, in some cases, of Meals on Wheels programs or the sharp reduction in the provision of Meals on Wheels programs for seniors. We have seen it in the elimination of slots for Head Start children. And certainly we are seeing it in areas affected by the Defense budget. And we knew that this would be the case, and that is why implementing bad policy was always a bad idea -- not something to be celebrated, not something to call a political victory for the tea party or any party, because there are real people who suffer the consequences of these arbitrary, across-the-board cuts -- unnecessary cuts in the sense that we can and should do better by making wise decisions about how we reduce our deficit, reducing it in a balanced way, the way that the President has been forward again and again in his budget proposals and in his offers to Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. So this does not have to happen. It did not need to happen. And the President certainly hopes that we can reach a compromise on budget issues that prevents this from continuing to happen. And the final topic is immigration. Chuck Schumer said, I think on Meet the Press , that he basically predicted by July 4th that as many as 70 senators would pass a bipartisan immigration bill through the Senate, acknowledging there are going to be some challenges when it reaches the House. Marco Rubio, though, today said that the immigration bill needs improvements to pass. So I am curious what improvements the President thinks need to be made to help this pass. I'd say a few things. One, the President continues to be encouraged by the progress being made in the Senate on comprehensive immigration reform. That process has now passed through committee, and we look forward to a robust debate and expect the legislation to move forward in a timely manner. As we have said, the Senate legislation may not contain every specific element we have called for, but it does represent an important step towards the broad principles the President has made clear need to be part of common-sense immigration reform. And so we look forward to continuing to work with Congress as the bill moves forward, and we will continue to advance the President's priorities as part of that process. But that process is ongoing; a lot of work remains to be done. We believe that the bill that emerged from committee reflects the President's principles, and we believe that the bill that passes through the Senate, with bipartisan support, should and needs to reflect the President's principles. And we will be engaged in that process as it moves through the Senate and beyond. But I think it is important to note that there is a lot of work to be done here, and we have seen with a variety of issues over time that victory can be declared early. And this is real work because it is something that requires bipartisan broad support. That support exists, the President believes, but it requires some elbow grease and some real grit and determination to get from here to completion. ENTITY, a minute ago you mentioned the reductions in government travel costs. Is there any effort on the part of the President to reduce travel costs -- his travel costs? Well, broadly speaking, the White House, as you know, has been affected by this sequester, and measures have been taken both to reduce costs here, as well as we have had to have furloughs in the White House Office. The President is President of the United States 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, as was the case with every one of the President's predecessors. And the nature of -- the way that he travels is very much a part of the office that he holds and is a requirement of that office, and he needs to be able to conduct his presidency in order to fulfill his obligation to the American people and the oath he took. So we are, in a variety of ways that I think OMB and others have spelled out, and I can -- and we can get you more information on that if you'd like -- taking action to reduce costs to deal with the sequester and some of that action includes furloughs. But I do not have anything more specific for you on that. Thank you. Later this week, the President meets with the President of China out in California. It is supposed to be partly a getting-acquainted session, but the President is also going to be bringing up hacking -- computer hacking and so forth. Does the President want to come away from that meeting with some deliverables? Well, I would, first of all, make the point that the President is acquainted with President Xi. They met prior to President Xi's accession to the presidency. But it is important now that he holds that office and President Obama has recently been reelected for this meeting to take place. And President Obama very much looks forward to it. There is a broad array of topics that the two leaders will discuss, and certainly, cybersecurity will be one of them. I would say that this is a discussion, and we are not trying to telegraph specific actions or so-called deliverables. The relationship that we have with China is broad and complex, and it is very important for these kinds of meetings to take place for that relationship to be developed, for us to work on greater cooperation where we have been able to cooperate, find new areas to cooperate, and also confront directly those areas where we disagree. And that has been the approach of this administration in our relations with China from the time the President took office. And we believe it is the right approach. Mr. Donilon was over there. Did he come back saying it is going to be really tough on -- talking on this subject? National Security Advisor Tom Donilon had an excellent visit to China where he met with an array of top government officials and military officials and obviously reported back to the President on that meeting. And the President's meeting with President Xi will build upon the meetings that National Security Advisor Donilon had. But again, I think that Mr. Donilon felt that his visit was a successful one. On Thursday, is there a legislative tie-in to this visit other than calling attention to this curriculum? Is he going to be asking Congress to do something specific? What is the -- I do not want to preview the event or the President's remarks more than I just did except to say broadly that, yes, the President believes Congress should be focused on what the American people are focused on. What specifically is he -- Again, I am not going to preview specifics from the President's event or the remarks, but there are a variety of actions that we believe Congress ought to join us in moving on. You heard the President address some of those, I believe, in his weekly address. And there is ample room for bipartisan action on an agenda that would strengthen the middle class, provide it more security and help it expand. And the middle class -- middle-class opportunity is the absolute cornerstone of our economy, and it has been the primary focus of the President's domestic policy since the day he took office. It is the primary focus of his economic and domestic agenda in his second term. And it is an important thing to remember that even as we deal with an array of issues here in Washington, that this is the thing -- this is the set of issues that the American people broadly care most deeply about because it affects their capacity to have and keep a job that can sustain a middle-class life; their capacity to send their children to college; their capacity to take care of their mothers and fathers as they grow old. And the President is deeply concerned about and focused on the need to make the middle class more secure and to create more opportunity for the middle class. So that is why this event is taking place on Thursday. It is part of a series that he will be engaged in, and he absolutely expects Congress to join him in taking action to assist and empower the middle class. To that end, could you tell us if the shrinking of the deficit is making it harder for the President to get the bipartisan deal that he wants with Republicans in order to make all the investments that he talks about on these trips? I mean, he is been searching for people to negotiate with him, but the deficit is coming down without either side doing anything. So is that having an effect? Let me take issue with that last sentence, because the deficit is coming down as sharply as it has been because the President and Congress did do something. They took direct action in 2009 that prevented a catastrophic recession from becoming a depression. They took direct action to pass the Affordable Care Act, which has, by any measure, helped bring down the growth in the cost of health care. They took direct action to write and pass a Wall Street reform law that will ensure that the kind of financial crisis that so battered our economy and the global economy cannot happen again. They took direct action to save the American automobile industry, an industry that is very much a part of American history and our sense of who we are, and also a great engine for economic growth and job creation. So let me be clear about that. But the President thinks we need to continue to take action to invest in our economy so it grows -- to ensure that the jobs we need for the 21st century are created here; to ensure that we are taking action to enhance our energy independence; and to reduce our deficit in a responsible way -- to continue to reduce our deficit in a responsible way. And he has had a number of conversations with Republican lawmakers about the need to find common ground on achieving just that. But he has always looked at it as part of an overall approach to economic policy that is focused first and foremost on economic growth and job creation; and as part of that project, responsible deficit reduction. So he believes that we can do that. He believes that there are Republicans who want to do that, and we just have to see if there is a coalescing of will to make it happen. You have seen the President's offers. They were very explicit in his budget -- very explicit in his budget as a reflection of the offer he made at the end of last year. And the offer is on the table, and it demonstrates the President's willingness to compromise, demonstrates the seriousness with which he approaches these issues, and he hopes that he will find partners in moving it forward. Earlier this spring, a lot of attention was paid to the so-called charm offensive . The President took Republican lawmakers out to dinner and had meetings with them and called them on the phone. And I am wondering if that outreach has continued, or was that sort of a one-time, kind of one-moment deal? Well, first of all, it cannot be one time if there were a series of meetings and conversations and dinners. Those conversations continue. It was fairly recently that Senator McCain -- who is obviously a leading Republican in the Senate and a major player on a variety of key issues, both domestic and national security -- was here visiting the President. And we will continue to have those engagements both at the presidential level and at the sub-presidential level. The President is sincere in this effort. He believes that we can find common ground, both on deficit reduction and budget issues as well as on immigration reform -- because some of these conversations and meetings the President has had with Republican lawmakers have not just been on deficit reduction and budgets, they have been on immigration reform. They were and will continue to be, hopefully, on ways we can reduce gun violence. They will be on and have been on ways that we can invest in our economy and build out our infrastructure to create jobs now and help our economy grow in the future. So that effort continues. Are there some more recent engagements you can tell us about? You mean in the last few days? You cannot declare something over after a few days, Phil. I think that we need to -- everybody needs to take a breath. And I know that the media cycle is what it is, but the President is fully engaged with members of Congress in both parties and will continue to be. And he has pressed with -- in every one of these meetings, for a willingness to find common ground. He has shown his willingness to compromise, and he has been encouraged by the sentiments expressed by some Republican lawmakers to do the same. And where there are opportunities to find that compromise and get something done on behalf of the American people, the President will seize them, and he will continue to have those conversations in search of them. I want to go back to China. It was not clear to me from your answer to Roger's question whether there will be deliverables come out of that. And just what would you expect to come out of it? Would there be some sort of a joint statement? Any appearance? Can you tell us anything about the format over Friday evening and Saturday? Well, we will have more details about the specifics of the engagements and the conversations. But the two Presidents plan to discuss the full range of diplomatic, economic and security issues on the U.S.-China agenda -- from the perspective of identifying shared interests and finding ways to work together to solve regional and global challenges, and discussing how to manage differences in a manner that ensures a stable and productive bilateral relationship. They will talk about their domestic economic situations -- these are the two largest economies in the world -- and the steps that each will take to promote sustained international -- sustained, rather, and balanced global growth because of the impact that these two economies have on global growth. I think it is important, while I wanted to assure Roger that it was not just a get-to-know-you session, that this is more -- it is deeper than that; that this is not a 1970s-style summit where there are pre-negotiated outcomes. This is very much part of an ongoing engagement that we have with the Chinese leadership at the presidential level and at all the levels in government. And it is very important, because of the size of our economies, the interdependence that we have as engines of global economic growth, the various issues where we cooperate, and the various issues where we do not see eye to eye on all things. And so sustaining that relationship and maintaining that engagement is very critical in the interest of the United States globally. Will there be any access for the press to the leaders? Any questions? I am not sure that we have announced anything yet. We have been working through that, and hopefully we will have more specifics for you in the near future. How might this redefine the whole Asia pivot? Because up until now, it is been really a -- seemed to be that the United States reasserting itself in the Pacific Rim region, reassuring the other Pacific Rim nations that it stands as a bulwark against China. So how does this fit this effort to sort of reset relations with the two leaders more personal? How does that fit into the more general Asia policy? We have made clear, or tried to, that our rebalancing, our pivoting to Asia has not been against any nation, not against China, but for the important role that the United States has traditionally and needs to continue to play in that region. The President made clear as a candidate and after he took office that he felt that we had, as a nation, turned away from Asia because of our largely understandable focus on the Middle East, but that that came at a cost to long-term U.S. interests. And he was determined to rebalance our foreign policy and our international economic policy in a way that made clear the importance that Asia -- the importance of Asia and the role that Asia plays in the 21st century, both economically and on security matters. But this is not a zero-sum thing; it is not against China at all. And that is why our engagement with China is part of the overall rebalancing, part of the focus on Asia that we need as a nation because of the explosive economic growth in the region, because of the huge potential in the region, because of the need to maintain stability and foster the expansion of economic growth and human rights in the region. So we -- it does not contrast with the effort we have been making; it complements it in our view. And I would note that, throughout this period, we have -- the President has engaged frequently with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi's predecessor. And we have, as an administration, have engaged with Chinese leadership all along, even as we have engaged in Asia and deepened our presence in Asia in a variety of different ways with a variety of different nations. Does the President have a view on this issue? The Supreme Court decided today whether the police have a right to take DNA samples from people who are being booked, who have been arrested as opposed to having to wait until they have been -- I have not had that conversation with him. The decision had come down before the meeting I had with him or that I was in with him, but it did not come up in the meeting, so I do not know. -- take that question? I do not know that we will have a comment on the case from here, but if we do, we will be sure to get it to you. Following up on Supreme Court issues and matters -- the Supreme Court is supposed to make a decision on voting rights, whether to uphold certain portions of voting rights. Is the White House expecting -- bracing for disappointment on that? Because as late as February, some persons within the administration were saying that they did not hold out a lot of hope. Well, I do not want to prejudge a decision that has not been produced yet by the Supreme Court, so I will not do that. But this is obviously an issue that we consider very important and we will look with interest upon the decision. But before we see it, I think I will refrain from commenting on it. And also, another question. This weekend was very loud with that quote, paid liar. Oh. I did not know what you meant by very loud, but okay. That quote was very loud -- I am just telling you -- and it brought you into focus, and you are the mouthpiece for the President and his White House. Did the President talk to you about that? April, I will not get into my personal conversations with the President. I can just tell you that I am not interested in a back and forth with the Chairman. I am interested in what I believe most who in Washington are looking at this issue are interested in, which is what the President's focus is on, which is that we need to get -- make sure we know everything that happened here and that those who were responsible for inappropriate conduct are held accountable, and that actions are taken so that it does not happen again. And that is our focus. So I appreciate the effort to get me to get into a back and forth , but I am not going to do it. That is not bringing you into a back and forth. I mean, you talked about the back and forth in the front row. I am now asking you, as the person who is the speaker for the White House beyond -- I mean, you are the first line, I guess, before the President, and you have now been brought into the fray with this with your spin. Did the President discuss this with you after that quote became so loud this weekend? I have not -- well, I am not going to get into conversations -- personal conversations, private conversations with the President -- between me and the President or the President and anyone else. What I will tell you is that we are focused on the substantive issues. And I think that that comment has been evaluated by plenty of people, and I will refrain from doing it myself. ENTITY, can you say -- Secretary Kerry said earlier today that the U.S. is going to sign the U.N. Arms Treaty. Do you have any idea of when the President might do that? And do you have any updates? I do not have a timing announcement to make. I think, as you are aware, or those of you who follow this issue know, that while we look forward to signing the treaty, there are remaining translation issues that have to be satisfactorily resolved. Because of the procedures involved, we anticipate this will not happen before the end of August. So I do not have anything more specific for you, but I think as you -- if you have followed this, there is been an issue because the treaty -- I think the treaty was negotiated in English but then, obviously, translated into a number of languages, as is common, and there were some discrepancies found in those translations that need to be resolved. And that will take some time. Do you have any expectations about that it will get through the Senate? I do not have any predictions to make. We obviously look forward to signing it and we believe it is in the interest of the United States, and we will work on furthering that effort once we get it signed. I think I have been told to wrap it up, so thanks very much.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney234", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-234", "publication_date": "03-06-2013", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 306, "text": "ENTITY, I want to ask you, first of all, your thoughts on the first half of play. It was a little bit more competitive maybe than some people thought. Well, you forget how many Brazilians are in the NBA now. Between Nene and Varejao and Barbosa, they have got a good team. So it took a while for our guys to kind of get into rhythm, but we are so much deeper that over time you get a sense they are going to wear them down. Predictions for the second half? I do not think it will be close in the second half. No. U.S.A. Basketball, ENTITY, has undergone a culture change. They bottomed out a little bit in 2004 with the Bronze, and then Coach Krzyzewski came aboard and really turned it around. Your thoughts on that process. Well, obviously, Coach K is one of the greatest coaches of all time. He knows how to bring together folks to think like a team. And obviously, the talent that we have got at this point is unbelievable. So there is no reason we should not bring home the Gold. We just have to stay focused. One thing I am happy about is to see how hard everybody is playing. You really get a sense of how proud they are to represent the United States, and I think they are going to conduct themselves really well in London. One of the subjects of great debate of late, started by one Kobe Bryant, was the fact that he feels that the present constitution of the team would beat the 1992 original version. Your thoughts on that. Can you weigh in on that argument for us? You know, this is a generational thing. I was around in '92. I was a Bulls fan, so I have got to go with the original Dream Team. And I suspect that Michael and Sir Charles and others would point out they were probably never down at any point in any of their games. But this is a great team, unbelievable talent, and Kobe is a competitor, so you expect him to do a little trash talking whenever the opportunity arises. You are a big basketball fan. Everybody knows that. And you are involved in coaching your daughters. We saw the U.S.A. Women's National Team win by a big margin earlier tonight. How would you characterize your experience in coaching your two daughters? Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the women's team. They are going to be as dominant, if not more dominant, I think in the Olympics. And wonderful young women; they are great role models for my daughter. And I had a chance to say hello to them before this game started. As you know, coaching kids, your heart is out there on the floor with them. I get more excited than I ever got when I was actually playing, watching Sasha or Malia play. They are really enjoying it, and to see them improve and start playing as a team always is great satisfaction. What you want to see in your kids, even if they are not going to be professionals, is just taking something seriously, learning how to put a lot into it and seeing them get something out of it. For your 49th birthday you had an all-star cast of players come to the White House for a much-celebrated pickup game. Who is coming to the next birthday party pickup game? Well, this summer these guys are busy. So they need to focus on the Olympics. But it was one of the most fun events that we have had. Did your team win? We actually had four teams, and my team did not win. I did not stack it. But LeBron and Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul and a whole bunch of folks Derrick Rose came. We had three pros and two amateurs on each team, and it was a lot of fun. Then we had a barbecue at the White House afterwards. And we did it in front of wounded warriors, so it gave them a chance to see up close and personal some of the greatest basketball talent. And the guys could not have been more generous signing shoes and jerseys and everything. So really enjoyed it and these are all some great guys. Thanks a lot for joining us, ENTITY. Really enjoyed it. Thank you, ENTITY.

{"id": 113, "text": "ENTITY, I wondered if you had a chance to see our replica of Columbus' ship, the Santa Maria. Not yet, I have not , but I expect that that commemoration next year is going to be fantastic, knowing the spirit of this place. Have you been invited to come, and do you plan to come? Well, I am not sure I have had a formal invitation. I will have to check with the schedulers. But obviously, I'd like to come. I am going to be participating in many events, because this is American. This is Columbus, Ohio, but it is American. It is broad, and it is big. And it will be wonderfully exciting, the various events. So I hope I get a chance to come here. We are right now planning a special program on AIDS aimed at teenagers. I know you were in Europe when Magic Johnson made his announcement. I wondered if there was anything more you wanted to say about him or that you would say to teenagers. Well, simply that Magic is coming onto the National AIDS Commission. And I believe from what I have heard him say that he will be, because of his fame, he will be a marvelous advocate for education, helping teenagers understand how to avoid getting AIDS. You cannot do it in every instance, but AIDS is one disease where behavior has a lot to do, a lot to do, with whether you get it or not, shooting dope or promiscuous sex. Those are areas where we need more education to the teenagers. And I think that that commission and I think that that individual can be extraordinarily helpful, saying here is what I have learned, here is what I believe. In the meantime, we are going forward with a vigorous and large funding in research. And we have got some great research that is hopeful research going on at NIH, National Institutes of Health, in Washington. Headlines all across the country today are talking about ENTITY Reviews Plans for Saddam's Ouster and Move Would Counter Democratic Critics , like Mario Cuomo, who says you waged the war well enough but lost the objective in that you did not get Saddam Hussein. Is there an effort now, an increased effort, to overthrow him? If I could, without being argumentative; that was not an objective. You remember the U.N. resolutions. It was to kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and teach the aggressor a lesson. And that was a lesson that he got loud and clear. So we have got to be careful about redefining objectives for the American people. But if your question is would I like to see him out of there and would we like to help in some way or another, the answer is, yes. But I did see that story. It is a little speculative. We never comment on anything that we are doing of a clandestine or covert nature and never should, because people's lives -- if they were doing this, and I am not confirming or denying anything -- could be put in danger by this. But I'd like to see him out. I will tell you what there is -- this is the first time I have said this -- there is some interesting information coming out of Iraq of increasing dissent. People are tired of this man. They are tired of seeing food and medicines go in only to have them ripped off and be sent to the Republican Guard or to the people in Tikrit. And so I think we are watching a situation with growing dissent, growing discouragement about this brutal dictator, regret at being isolated by the world community. And who knows what the dynamics inside Iraq will eventually be when that move that I mentioned now just becomes paramount, when everybody feels that way? Is it difficult having been such a hero of the Gulf war and to see the popularity polls reflecting that and then to see the popularity rating come down with the economy? Do people expect too much of ENTITY that way? No, I think ENTITY has to -- I think people, when they are frustrated on an economic sense, they will blame Congress, they will blame ENTITY, they will blame the Governor. They will blame anybody. But people are hurting. And so I can understand it. I would like to say, without being rancorous about it, that if Congress has passed some of the economic growth package that I put forward in the State of the Union and the programs that I have put forward since then, I think we'd be much further along in terms of a boisterous recovery, a robust recovery. But, look, I do not think the American people want blame. I am going to try to constrain myself a little. I will go to some political events, and I will hammer away at the Democrats as they are doing on me right now. But more important is, what can we do to help people? And I am going to continue to fight for the programs that I think will help the American people. And we can take care of the politics later on. And you cannot live or die by polls. I did not live euphorically at 86 percent, nor am I wringing my hands now. You try to assure everyone that the economy is doing well enough, and yet 69 percent of the people, according to the Associated Press, say that the economy is not doing well. It is not, and I do not try to assure them it is doing well enough. Please, that is not what I try to do. I try to put things in perspective. When people talk about Herbert Hoover depressions, they simply do not know what they are talking about. When you see interest rates where they are and you see inflation under control, these are good fundamentals. But still people are hurting. So I think you need to -- I think ENTITY owes the American people his judgment. And I do not think that we ought to try to talk ourselves, as seems to be happening by some, into worse times. You see, I have this funny feeling that some of the political opponents think that the only way they can propel themselves to victory is to make America think that everything is wrong. Things are wrong. They can be corrected. I am in Ohio talking about a revolutionary new education program, America 2000. That will help enormously. And it will help fairly short run. We moved forward on unemployment benefits. That is helping those now who are hurting. So, we have got some programs that can be short run and some much longer run. Interesting in Reader's Digest this month, a little quote that says you were asked one time what was your favorite Presidential speech, the one you admire the most. And you said it was one that Teddy Roosevelt had carried in his pocket that helped to deflect an assassin's bullet. And I wondered, is that something that concerns ENTITY a great deal all the time, the concern about yourself or about your family being in a position like that? Not really. Not in terms of security. We have the best Secret Service and dedicated young men and women that really go the extra mile for protection. So I do not wake up worrying about that kind of threat. On the family side, I worry more about what you put your kids through, what you put your family through by just being in the arena. It is a little ugly out there, charge and countercharge. And what troubles me is it might get a little worse as the political season goes on. There is a certain ugliness, and I'd like to try to avoid that. But that is on the family side what concerns me, not personal security. I honestly do not think about that. Your call for reducing credit card interest rates got part of the blame for the plunge 120 points on the stock market. Is that fair? I do not think so because I have also jawboned the Fed, saying would not it be nice to have lower interest rates. And no Congressman went out and tried to pass usury laws and put them on the Fed. And, yes, I'd love to see all interest rates as low as possible. But here, where I differ with what Congress did, I do not think we can go in and legislate that kind of cap that they tried to do. Because I honestly would like to see these rates lower. And indeed, some have come down since I said that. But capping it and putting Federal legislation on, that was passed by overwhelming Democrat and Republican support, I do not think is the answer. So whether I should be accorded some of the blame, I do not know. I did not get the blame when I urged that the Fed lower the interest rates, and indeed, they did lower. I know you are a sports fan. I wonder if there is anything you want to say to Ohio State fans who are feeling badly about having lost to Michigan for the fourth straight time, and the coach gets a renewal on his contract. Anything that you -- -- No, other than that I saw the game. It was a tough game. Michigan was tough. We all know that. I saw some of it, a lot of it. And I am not a guy that bashes the coach. I knew Woody Hayes pretty well. Indeed, not only knew him as a political supporter but as a friend. And I learned from Woody, stay in there and drive, and so I wish the coach well. I do not know enough about it to get involved in Ohio State politics and all. But he is a good man. We have ups and downs in the world of politics like he does on the gridiron. Finally, with interest rates coming down as they have, have you given any thought to refinancing the White House? I'd like to refinance -- actually, we are refinancing the Federal deficit, the Federal debt as these rates are lower. And that is not a bad thing. So I am glad the rates are down. And at some point they will kick in. Housing rates are down. And sometime when confidence gets restored, people will say, this is a good time to buy a house. In the meantime, we have got to help those people who do not have the money to buy a house and are trying to make ends meet. ENTITY, thank you very much. It was a privilege for me. Thank you.

{"id": 86, "text": "First of all, thanks for doing this. Glad to. I want to talk to you about guns, gun legislation. But the day's news is on Elian Gonzalez. His father is here; the boy's father is here. How soon can he expect to see the child? Well, first, I think we should say it is a good thing that he is here. I am glad he is here. And the Justice Department is working on that, and I think in a way we are fortunate to have an Attorney General who understands this issue, because Janet Reno was the prosecutor in Dade County for many years. And they are working on it. I do not know, I cannot answer with any specifics. But I have confidence that they will do the best they can to handle it in an expeditious and sensitive way. In an expeditious and sensitive way. ENTITY, from almost all other citizens, if the Immigration Service rules, and a Federal judge backs the ruling, then people will obey the law. What is happened here? Well, I think the people-you can ask them; they can speak for themselves better than I do. But they, I think they feel that they are not sure that the process was adequate since it occurred in Cuba. I think that is basically what is going on. And you know, some of the people there are just against anybody going back to Cuba. But I think there are a lot of people who have genuine questions about it. And I think the fact that the father has come here and will be in a position to show his concern for and desire to be reunited with his son should be a big help. And as I said, I think the Justice Department will do a good job here, and I think Attorney General Reno really understands what is going on. And I think we will work through it. You have consistently said that the father speaks for the son. You stand by that? Well, that is the decision that was made by the INS. They went down and interviewed the father extensively. And they concluded that based on his previous contacts, which were regular, with his son, that he was a fit representative to speak for his son. And under our law, since Elian Gonzalez is a very young child, someone must be the designated person to speak for him. And under our law, the parent, as long as he is a fit parent, is that person. So the INS made the decision that they felt was appropriate, and the judge ruled that they had the authority to make it. And now the family members in Miami are appealing to the Court of Appeals and arguing that there ought to be a more extensive inquiry into his best interests. That is the legal position. But I think that the main thing is that the Justice Department is handling it and that in the end the law ought to prevail. And I do not think that the young man's best interests are served by the rest of us talking about it too much. I think the Justice Department is going to try to work through this, and I have confidence that Janet Reno will handle it in a good way. I respect what you say about perhaps we should not discuss it too much. But the mayor of Miami-I have in mind you saying, well, the law takes care of this. But the mayor of Miami has said that if anything bad happens, he will hold you and Janet Reno directly responsible, and-I think I quote him, at least indirectly, correctly-do not expect any help from him or the city of Miami in enforcing the law. Did that surprise you? It did. But I think there is been some indication since then that he and others want to get this back in a lawful process. And I think the mayor of Miami is a fine young leader with an enormous amount of potential. But he represents the Cuban-American community. He is part of it. They have-I think that it is fair to say they have a big presumption against anything that happens in Cuba, including an INS proceeding. But I think that in the end, the rule of law will prevail in this country. The overwhelming majority of Cuban-Americans are law-abiding good citizens. They have made a great contribution to our country. And I think in the end, the rule of law will prevail. And I think we ought to have-just take a deep breath here and realize this is a highly unusual case, and let the Attorney General work through it. I believe that they will. I believe she will do a good job on this. ENTITY, you have consistently said that we should not politicize the case of this 6-year-old boy. But your Vice President has broken with your administration's position, a clearly political move. One, were you surprised by that? And two, are you irritated or angry about it? Well, first of all, I do not know that it was clearly political, in the sense that there was a bill introduced in the Congress to deal with what the people in Miami say is the main defect in the INS proceeding. They say- you know, it is interesting. If you notice, they have not attacked the father. They have not claimed that he was an unfit father. Their claim is entirely different. Their claim is that even if he is a fit father, that it is not in Elian Gonzalez's best interests to be returned, at least at this moment. That is their position. So they say, if the INS followed the law, then the law ought to be changed so that a determination of his best interests can be made. Now, once the bill was introduced-there are a lot of reasons I do not agree with the bill. I do not support the bill. But once the bill was introduced, I think every public figure in America, national figure, was going to have to take a position on it. And as a matter of fact, I do not believe it was a purely political position. I know the conventional wisdom is that the Vice President's position was purely political, but he talked to me-I do not know, a day or two after Elian Gonzalez's case became public, weeks and weeks and weeks ago, and said, You know, I am very worried about this process. I am afraid we are going to have a lot of problems with this process. I am just not sure it is adequate. So you know, he personally and privately said that to me long before this bill was introduced and long before it became a matter of big public debate. So that is the way he personally feels. And because of that and, I think, because he is himself a candidate now, I think he had to take a position and say what he thought. Respectfully, ENTITY, a member of the Vice President's staff has been quoted as saying that it was a political decision. And too, he went on to say, the Vice President is not going to fall on his sword for you. That would lead a reasonable person to believe that it was a political decision. Well, I do not know. You know, if I knew who said that and they were quoted by name, I would have more regard for the quote. I do not think he should fall on his sword for me. He is out there now making his own case to the American people. All I can tell you is, I will bet you that staff member did not know that I talked to Al Gore shortly after this case became public, and he said to me privately that he was disturbed about the process and whether it could adequately account for this young man's best interests. That is what he told me a long time ago, purely privately, and long before he ever said anything publicly about it. I want to move on to the subject of guns, but before we-just as we leave this-- He might have meant, you know, that falling on your sword sometimes means that you have to agree with the President, whether you really agree with the President or not. That is what Vice Presidents do when they are not independent candidates. And since I do not think he agrees with me, and since he is a candidate, I do not think he should mask an honest disagreement. And it is one that I believe that he actually believes, based on a private conversation I had long before he ever made a public statement. So you do not have any problem with it? No. Let us talk about guns. Next week, is it fair to say you are dedicating the week to doing what you can to get increased, at least, handgun control? Yes. You are going to Maryland to be seen with the Governor as he signs a new handgun control law into law. Then you are going to Colorado, where there is a State ballot initiative that you are backing, and this initiative contains many of the provisions that you seek in Federal law. Question, why no focus on getting new State laws passed, rather than press forward with Federal legislation? Because it'll take forever and a day. And because if you have Federal laws, they can be more efficiently administered. I mean, if you look at-and let me back up and say, I consider these measures gun safety measures. I think gun control is still sort of an explosive term to the American people, because they think we are going to take somebody's guns away from them. And the truth is, all we have tried to do is to take preventive measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. And I think that on the specific measures, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people support us. And Colorado, which is a predominately Republican State, I believe this initiative will pass because they have had experience with it. And I think that it is unconscionable for Congress to hide behind the fact that there are States taking action. Maryland required child trigger locks this week, for example, and required safety training courses and things of that kind for handgun purchases. The State of Massachusetts applied its consumer protection laws to handguns, and Colorado has got this initiative to close the gun show loophole, which I think is very important. But it will take forever and a day for all the States to do that, and the Federal Government ought to do it. It is a Federal responsibility and a national problem. You know, it is simply an extension of what we did with the Brady bill. We had all this hoopla when I signed the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban about how damaging it was to the rights of gun owners, the legitimate hunters and sports people. Not a single hunter has missed a day in the deer woods; not a single sports person has missed a sport shooting contest. Nobody has been burdened by this, and a half-million felons, fugitives, and stalkers have not gotten handguns as a result. Gun crime is at a 30-year low in America, not just because we have increased gun prosecutions, which we have, but because we have done more prevention. That is what this is about. You are in a fierce fight on Capitol Hill to get Federal additional gun safety legislation passed. Yes. And you set April 20th, the anniversary of the Columbine, Colorado, high school shootings as the goal. Is there any chance that it would get passed by that time? Probably not. We have a majority for it in both Houses, I think. But the Republican leadership in the Senate may be able to keep it from coming to a vote. They cannot really keep things from coming to a vote in the House, so I think there is a majority for closing the gun show loophole, a majority for banning the importation of large scale ammunition clips. Who could be against that? We have got an assault weapons ban in the country, and then we turn around and make a mockery of it by letting people import these big ammunition clips which they can put on the guns and convert them into assault weapons. There ought to be child trigger locks on guns. Most manufacturers do it anyway. It ought to be a national requirement. But I think we are making progress. I think the action in these States indicates it; the initiative in Colorado, with the support of many Republican officials in Colorado; the incredibly brave action that Smith & Wesson has taken to try to improve the way it markets and distributes guns and the way those handguns are sold. I hope they will find some resonance among other gun manufacturers. So we are making progress. but this is a brutal fight. The interest behind it, the status quo, are very strong. Do you suppose, if I may-I do not mean to interrupt-you say the interest behind this is very strong. As Butch Cassidy said to the Sundance Kid, Who are these guys? Well, the NRA and other groups even to the right of them, and a lot of people in the Congress, in the Republican Party, really agree with them. A handful of Democrats do. But it is basically a party fight. And again I say, if they had any evidence that we had undermined hunting or undermined sport shooting or even undermined legitimate self-defense, it would be one thing. They do not . The only evidence they have is we have kept handguns out of the hands of half million felons, fugitives, and stalkers. And the last place, besides person-to-person transactions, that such people can get handguns with impunity is at these gun shows. So we ought to close the gun show loophole and do a background check. It is a no-brainer. There are some minor details of adjustment that would have to be undertaken to do these background checks, to make it work when you do these one-day shows out in rural areas. But they can easily be taken care of, and we ought to do it. You mentioned the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate. What I and other reporters talk to them, they say, basically, Look, the President could get a lot of what he wants. He could get the trigger locks for children on handguns. He could get the ban on importing the extra long clips-if the President would simply compromise on the criminal background checks for gun shows. Why not make that compromise? Well, first of all, we already offered a compromise. John Conyers has offered a compromise to Representative Henry Hyde that we were hoping could prevail in the conference. You know, the bill is in conference now. We got a good bill out of the Senate on this gun show loophole because the Vice President broke the tie. The bill is in conference, and Mr. Conyers offered a compromise. Let me say, if you look at the gun shows, they want insta-check. And here is the problem. When you do these background checks-let us just look at the facts-when you do the background checks, you can get over 70 percent of the background checks done in the first hour. You can get 95 percent of them done-or over 90 percent in the first day. So they say, Well, just agree to a 24-hour background check or an insta-check system. The real difficulty is, of the roughly 10 percent you cannot finish in one day, the rejection rate in that 10 percent is 20 times higher than the rejection rate in the 90 percent. So what we tried to do was to work out an agreement where we let everybody who would be cleared, be cleared, but we did not have an automatic release for the others, because they are 20 times more likely to have background problems which would not enable them to purchase these guns. So I think it is an almost bizarre development, since we are more than willing to meet them halfway. We have offered them a good compromise-that they would hold this whole bill up to protect that 10 percent when they know that is where a huge percentage of the problem gun-buyers are, people that are likely to use those guns for criminal conduct. So we have offered a compromise. John Conyers offered a good compromise to Representative Henry Hyde, and I hope and pray that they will take it or something like it. I am willing to compromise, but I do not think that we ought to gut the main purposes of the background check. And again, you know, they say, Well, we have these shows out in the country. They occur on the weekend. They are not all basically at big-city convention centers. But the gun could be deposited with the local sheriff's office for the weekend while the background check is completed, for example. You could deposit the gun and the check and return one or the other or both. It would be easy to work through this if they really wanted to. I just think it is important-I think the child trigger locks are important because the accidental death rate in America of the children are so high, 9 times higher than the next 25 biggest countries combined. But we ought to close the loophole in the Brady law. I am willing to compromise, but I do not want to destroy the purposes of the background check. Our correspondent Maureen Maher has been doing some investigation of some of the loopholes in the Brady law, which turn out to be pretty extensive. If you could close one loophole in the Brady law, what would it be? Oh, the gun show loophole. That is the most important one. There are some other loopholes in the Brady law, but if you look at the numbers, it is been quite successful. For all of its problems, it is been quite successful. And when you do the insta-check, you know, we have to do instant checks whenever we can-when you do the insta-check, you actually-you lose some people, because if you cannot wait 3 days, there are some records that have not been logged in, for example, that will not be picked up on the insta-check. But when we passed the Brady bill, that is the best we could do. We had to take a bill that would say a 3-day waiting period, but insta-check whenever possible when it became possible. And so we are stuck with that for the time being. I have a totally different view of this than the people on the other side of the issue. I think I have demonstrated in 7 years here I have never tried to take a gun away from a lawabiding citizen. I have never tried to interfere with hunting or sport shooting. But I believe that guns are like every other area of national life where there is a lot of loss of life and injury. Prevention is always the first line of defense. Their position, basically, is: Punish people that violate the law; throw the book at them; but in this area alone, let us do not have much prevention, because we are worried about the second amendment or a slippery slope or whatever. And I just think they are wrong. I think that we can save so many more lives by sensible prevention and not interfere with legitimate gun owners. ENTITY, did you ever own a gun? Oh, yes. I have owned a shotgun. I had a .22 when I was little kid. I had a couple of handguns when I was a Governor. Did you hunt? Oh, yes. I suppose I was 12 the first time I had target practice, you know, shooting cans off fenceposts. And I normally went hunting, duck hunting, once a year when I was Governor. On occasion, I went bird hunting. I have been duck hunting a couple of times since I have been President. Let me follow up on this Smith & Wesson deal. A number of people, none of whom want their name attached to it, say, ENTITY, you have to look into this deal, because, one, Smith & Wesson was about to go bankrupt, and so this was a form of what they call financial blackmail. Anything to that argument? Not that I know of. I do not know that-if it is true, I do not know it. I understand. Any agreement that you know of, the Federal Government has agreed to supply Federal law enforcement officers with Smith & Wesson weapons? No, that was not a part of the agreement. Since then, we have looked into the question of whether we-as have many local jurisdictions looked into the question-whether they can give any kind of preference or consideration to Smith & Wesson in their purchases because they have taken this action. But obviously, whatever they do will have to take account of the need to get the best possible weapons for their law enforcement officials. But that was not a quid pro quo; that was something that came up later. And we are looking into-I wanted to look into to see what, if anything, we can do as well. But I know that a lot of cities were so appreciative of what Smith & Wesson did. See, here is the deal. This is another thing. This is like the Brady bill gun show loophole. The main thing Smith & Wesson did in changing its marketing and distribution policies was to focus on a fact that I would think that the NRA would want us to focus on, and that is that an inordinately high percentage of guns used in crimes are sold through a very small percentage of the gun sellers. So the main thing, when you strip away everything else Smith & Wesson did, what they are really trying to do is to stop providing weapons to people who obviously are careless in enforcing the Brady bill or have a criminal clientele or otherwise just are not taking care of their business. I would have thought when Smith & Wesson came forward, since this had nothing to do with the Brady bill or anything else-this was about having gun dealers clean up their act and gun manufacturers putting the hammer on them to do it, rewarding those that are good, punishing those that are not . I would have thought that is the kind of thing the NRA would like. I was actually kind of surprised that they and the gun dealers went so totally the other way about this, because you cannot get out of the fact-we now have evidence-a very small percentage of gun dealers sell a very high percentage of the guns used in serious crimes. That is what we are trying to get at. ENTITY, I have all kinds of things I'd like to ask you about, including China and the World Trade Organization, but the clock is running on us. Let me ask you two questions, and I will let you get on to your next meeting. You recently said at a meeting that the First Lady, in her bid for a Senate seat in New York, faces-I think this is your direct quote- a right-wing venom machine that is collecting double tons of money to defeat her. Was that too strong, on reflection? Well, it depends on how you interpret the facts. Richard Viguerie is doing Mayor Giuliani's mail. Mayor Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York, basically said, I am not a Reagan Republican anymore. I am a moderate Republican. I am pro-choice. I am for the Brady bill. I am for the assault weapons ban. I am for the President's crime program. We worked together. We had a good relationship. Now he is got Richard Viguerie doing this venomous mailing, talking about what a left-wing crazy my wife is, when-while he was mayor of New York, he was in agreement with her and me on most issues. While he was helping the mayor. No, while Rudy Giuliani was mayor. But the Viguerie mailings, which are being sent to people who have fought me the whole time I am here-which is fine-are basically using the same old standard hard-core right-wing stuff, the kind of stuff we saw Governor Bush do to Senator McCain in South Carolina, that kind of-sort of that kind of thing. And I think if he is going to do it and get the benefit of it, he can raise a lot of money, because a lot of us folks see beating Hillary or beating the Vice President as another way of going after us for what we have tried to do here on issues like gun safety and vetoing the big tax cuts to keep a balanced budget and the surplus and other things we have fought for. They see that as a way of continuing the battle. He can raise a lot of money that way, but I do not think he should be able to raise it for free. That is, I think he ought to have to be accountable for the rhetoric being used in his behalf and the money that is coming in as a result of that kind of inflammatory right-wing rhetoric. Would you be surprised if I told you that tonight's CBS poll indicates the First Lady is up by 8 points now in the race with Giuliani? A little bit. But I think it is going to be a close race and a hard race. But she knows why she is running. She knows what she wants to do for New York. I am really proud of her, and I just-I think these polls will change a lot between now and November. He is a very formidable opponent. You do not think that what one newspaper has called the wealthy hate Hillary campaign will, in the end, sink her? No, I do not . I think the main thing that she is got to think about is not what they are saying about her but what she is going to say to the people of New York. I think a lot of that is-when you have opposition in politics, a lot of times what they are trying to do is distract you from doing your main job, which is to communicate with the people and to serve the people. And I think if she will just focus on that, talk about her life, her work, and what she wants to do, I think she will do fine. ENTITY, I am getting the cut signal. I so much appreciate you taking the time to do this. Thank you very, very much. Thanks, ENTITY. Tell the First Lady hello for us. I will.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdanratherthecbseveningnews0", "title": "Interview With Dan Rather of the CBS Evening News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dan-rather-the-cbs-evening-news-0", "publication_date": "06-04-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 226, "text": "My guest tonight, he is currently the ENTITY. Please welcome back to the program ENTITY. Nice to see you. Thank you. How are you? I am good. How are you? Good to see everybody. Good to see you. How are you? I am doing great. Before I do anything else Please. I have to acknowledge we have some amazing women warriors - Yes. our we have got a whole crew of veterans I had nothing to do with this the USO wanted to bring them here. And I just wanted everybody to give them a big round of applause, too. Nice to see you guys. I do want to ask you this, though, before we I am putting together a scrapbook of the whole 2012 campaign, and I do not I have these great pictures from the two debates. But I do not know which debate they are from. So if you could I have two pictures. There is there is one picture. I do not know if you can get that. And then there is the other picture. And I am wondering, could you tell me which were the I do not I do not know if I have the dates right. Do you know which debate is which? Cute. Cute, ENTITY. What happened? What? Did you feel did you here is what happens to me sometimes. Sometimes I will go onstage and I will have, let us say, an open-faced turkey sandwich and a shot of NyQuil. And It is a good combination. and halfway through, I will look up and go, are we on? Did you sense were you taken aback by the reaction to it? Did you sense this was not going as well as perhaps you would like it to? What happened? Look, you know, I think, obviously, I had an off night. The presentation was not the way it needed to be. But the issues have not changed. They did not change after the first debate, and they did not change in the second debate Right. and that is that the stakes in this election are really big. You know, Governor Romney makes a good presentation, but the fundamentals of what he is calling for are the same policies that got us into this mess that we have been fighting against for the last four years, trying to dig our way out of an economy that was good for a few folks at the top, but was not working for ordinary Americans. And after 31 months of consecutive job growth, we have seen 5.2 million jobs created, manufacturing is starting to come back, the auto industry recovering, housing starting to rise again. I want to make sure that we are not going back to those policies. And I want to make sure that, over the next four years, we are building on the progress that we have already made to create jobs right here in America for folks and to make sure that middle-class families have some security. Would you say do you feel like you have a stronger, affirmative case for a second ENTITY presidency, or a stronger negative case for a Mitt Romney presidency? What isin your mind, what is the stronger case to be made? Or do you prefer a ? But what is because I am curious, what do you think? Do you feel like you do you feel you have made the strong enough, affirmative case, or a stronger negative case? I think I have got a strong case on both ends. Look, four years ago, I said I'd end the war in Iraq; we did. Said I'd pass health care reforms, make sure people do not go bankrupt when they get sick; we have. Said that we would refocus our attention on al-Qaida; we have. Made sure that made sure that we saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse; we have done that. So we have got a very strong story to tell, whether it is on social issues, like do not ask, do not tell, or economic issues that matter for middle-class families. I do think that part of the ENTITY's job is not only moving forward on things that will work, but also preventing things that will not work. Right. So I think you want a ENTITY in the Oval Office who is going to say, no, we are not going to amend our Constitution for the first time to restrict rights for gay and lesbian couples. We are not going to we are not going to we are not going to pass a budget where all the work that we have done to make college more affordable for young people gets wiped aside so that suddenly lenders and banks are getting extra tens of billions of dollars. We are not going to rollback health care so that millions of people are thrown off the rolls. We are not going to turn Medicare into a voucher system. So but but when you think about it, it is it is two sides of the same coin. The question is, what kind of vision do you have for this country? We need to make sure that we are developing oil and gas, but we are also developing solar and wind. So we are leapfrogging current technology to make sure that the technology 20 or 30 years from now is developed here in the United States. That is what creates jobs. And I the most important thing is, when you think about the economy, I am absolutely convinced, when you look at the historical record, that when middle-class families do well, when there are ladders of opportunity for poorer families to get into the middle class Right. the entire economy does well. And when a few folks are doing very well at the top and everybody else is getting squeezed, the economy grows slower. And that is the central issue in this election, that we have got to make sure we address. If you had to say, Governor Romney, there is one place where you feel like, man, that is an area I wish I had done I had a stronger record on that he hits, is it unemployment? Is it the case you know, he talked in the debate, you know, the administration had said, we are going to have this thing down to 5.4 percent, it is still at 7.8 percent, that is a difference of 9 million people. Is there something in what he says? Or is there a certain inevitability to a slower economic comeback? Well, here is what happened. We had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We could be growing even faster than we have if Governor Romney's allies in Congress would move on some of the things that we have recommended. I will give you an example. On housing, right now we could make sure that families whose homes are underwater, where they owe more than their mortgage or more than their house is worth, if they refinance, typically they get 3,000 bucks in their pockets a year. Right. That is $3,000 they are spending Right. or $3,000 that they are putting back into equity in their home. Housing market would be helped. Employment would be helped. Even Governor Romney's own adviser says this is a good idea. And yet Right. Governor Romney opposes it. So But do not you have a HAMP program? Do not you have was not $50 billion set aside for HAMP, and only 5 1/2 billion of it has been used? No. Actually what is happened is we have got 5 million homes that have already we have seen foreclosures prevented. We have a settlement with the banks that provides another $25 billion to help the housing market. But the central question is, there are a whole bunch of things that we can do right now Right. that will make the recovery even stronger, put more folks back to work. When you look at what we did with the auto industry, that is not the only industry where manufacturing can take root back here in the United States again. Now, we have got a whole bunch of cities where you have got workers who are, you know, trained in machinery and advanced manufacturing, but and companies are starting to look at maybe we in-source instead of outsource. But we are going to have to change the tax code to make sure that companies have a strong incentive to do that. If the Republican Congress was obstinate before, will not are not they still going to be there? Or if you win again, do you get to, at some point, say and I am just going to throw a phrase out there abracadabra? But so if their is what created the drag on the economy, and that is not going to be ameliorated, what will be the difference? Well, number number one, I want to make sure that we get as many Democrats re-elected as possible and maybe we can take some seats back. I think that is priority. Number two number two, when you look at some of the things that we need to do, let us say, in the first year, 2013, having a plan to bring down our deficit that is balanced, that will be settled one way or another next year. The question is going to be, do we do it in a balanced, responsible way, or are we not asking millionaires and billionaires to pay a dime of extra taxes to preserve investments in education? Wait, I am sorry. This is the first I am hearing of this. What is that about millionaires? It is true. It is true. What are you doing to us? ENTITY No, I am going to throw a commercial in. You and I are going to have a conversation and then we will come back. We are going to have to go to commercial. Welcome back. We are here with ENTITY. The second half. And we are going to start to go a little faster, the questions are going to get a little bit tougher. How many times a week does Biden show up in a wet bathing suit to a meeting? Just the ballpark figure. I had to put out a presidential directive on that. We had to stop that. You have got to put towels down. Yeah. I have got to say, though, he looks pretty good. I do not doubt that in any way, shape or form. All right. This is a little game I called Still or No. So you are the ENTITY now. Before when you ran, you had certain things that you thought, I wonder if four years as ENTITY has in any way changed that. OK, first one is, we do not have to trade our values and ideals for our security. We do not . Do you still feel that way? We do not . There is some things that we have not gotten done. I still want to close Guantanamo. We have not been able to get that . You know, one of the things that we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need congressional help to do that to make sure that not only am I reined in, but any ENTITY's reined in in terms of some of the decisions that we are making. Now, there are some tough tradeoffs. I mean, there are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world and you have got to make a call, and it is not optimal. But when you look at our track record, what we have been able to do is to say we ended the war in Iraq, we are winding down the war in Afghanistan, we have gone after al-Qaida and its leadership. It is true that al-Qaida is still active, at least sort of remnants of it are staging in other parts of North Africa and the Middle East. And sometimes you have got to make some tough calls. But you can do so in a way that is consistent with international law and with American law. Within that, as it ratchets down, I think people have been surprised to see the strength of the Bush-era warrantless wiretapping laws and those types of things not also be lessened. That the strictures that he put in place that people might have thought were government overreach and that, and that maybe they had a mind that you would perhaps tone down, you have not . Well, you know, the truth is actually we have modified them and built a legal structure and safeguards in place that were not there before on a whole range of issues. Now, they are not real sexy issues. They are not the kinds of things that you are going to you You do not know what I find sexy. Let me put it this way. I saw you flash that Shades of Grey thing, so I know what you have been reading. Yes, yes, yes, yes. We are not going to go there. I appreciate that. I am still the ENTITY. No, I understand that. I understand. I respect the position. The second thing and this one I thought and in the debate, it was obviously a big moment. Governor Romney said, you never called what happened in Benghazi a terrorist attack, you said, check the transcripts. Candy Crowley said, he did call it that, but also said to the larger point there was confusion within the administration over what happened. Why? What was it that caused that confusion? Well, we were not confused about the fact that four Americans had been killed. Sure. I was not confused about the fact that we needed to ramp up diplomatic security around the world right after it happened. I was not confused about the fact that we had to investigate exactly what happened so it gets fixed. And I was not confused about the fact that we are going to hunt down whoever did it Right. and bring them to justice. So as I said during the debate, nobody's more interested in figuring this out than I am. When a tragic event like this happens on the other side of the world Right. immediately, a whole bunch of intelligence starts coming in, people try to piece together exactly what happened. Right. And what I have always tried to do is to make sure that we just get all the facts, figure out what went wrong and make sure it does not happen again. And we are still in that process now. But everything that every piece of information that we get, as we got it, we laid it out for the American people. And the picture, you know, eventually gets fully filled in and we know exactly what happens. And then we know how we make sure we prevent it in the future. The difficulty, the perceptions seem to be that state was on a different page than you, or that you had Susan Rice five days afterwards saying on shows, well, this video and could have been a part of that and then other people were coming out ENTITY, you know, the truth is is that information comes in, folks put it out. Throughout the process, people say it is still incomplete. What I was always clear about was we are going to do an investigation and figure out exactly what happened. And Is part of the investigation helping the communication between these divisions of not just what happened in Benghazi, but what happened within? But I do not know. I would say even you would admit, it was not the optimal response, at least to the American people, as far as us all being on the same page. Well, here is what I will say. If four Americans get killed, it is not optimal. Right. And we are going to fix it. Right. All of it. All of it. And what happens during the course of a presidency is that, you know, the government is a big operation. At any given time, something screws up, and you make sure that you find out what is broken and you fix it. And you know, whatever else, you know, I have done throughout the course of my presidency, the one thing that I have been absolutely clear about is America's security comes first and the American people need to know exactly how I make decisions when it comes to war, peace, national security and protecting Americans. And they will continue to get that over the next four years of my presidency. All right, so last question. Last question. This is the last question. We have been speaking now for, I think, a good 12 to 14 minutes. And I am curious, how many emails during that time do you think your campaign has sent me? It depends on But here is what I will say to everybody who is watching. The stakes on this could not be bigger. War, peace, Supreme Court, women's right to choose, you know, whether we are creating jobs in this country or whether they are getting shipped overseas, whether our kids are getting the best education they can, all that stuff is at stake. And you know, there is no excuse not to vote. That is for sure. So make sure to vote. Head to the polls. And I hope you vote for me! With ENTITY.

{"id": 248, "text": "Thank you for being here, ENTITY. Great to be here. Very excited to do an interview with Re/code. And we have a lot of topics to talk about in tech. Let us go. We are going to go from cyber security, your relationship with Silicon Valley, privacy, STEM education. Got it all covered. Got it all covered, all right. Let us go. Mr. Tech, okay. So let us talk about cyber security first. This is a cyber security summit. You had Tim Cook talking about it, all kinds of different leaders. Right. The dangers of what is happening. Right now, there is been a lot of instances of cyber security breaches, Sony being the most famous. Right. The government said North Korea was behind this? Yeah. Are these acts of war? I would not consider them acts of war. But I would consider them acts of property damage, commercial theft, that are serious. And whenever a criminal act like that is state-sponsored, it is a problem. I just had a terrific roundtable with CEOs and chief information officers from a whole bunch of different sectors of the economy. And one of the uniform things they said was state actors are in a different category because of the sophistication and the resources and the patience that they have. That is an area where private sector's going to have to get help immediately from the government in a much more aggressive way, and a lot of what we are doing in terms of information sharing, gathering data, getting it out, disseminating it all throughout the economy much quicker we have gotten better at that. Then what you have is a bunch of non-state actors, hackers, criminals, etc., that are just flooding the system, constantly probing for weaknesses. And part of what this summit is about is both making sure that we have mechanisms for government/private sector cooperation, increased consumer awareness of how they can reduce their vulnerabilities, how we can build better defenses, how we can respond better and more resiliently. And one of the big conclusions is this is moving so fast that we have got to have a more nimble system. This is not a traditional setting where you can just set up a few standards or rules I get that. or regulations, and then just sit on our laurels. We have to constantly update all the time. But what does it have to be to become more serious? Shutting down New York? We are very vulnerable, as we become more digital. We are hugely vulnerable. We have started with critical infrastructure. That is an area where heavy involvement with those industries whether it is Wall Street and the financial sector, utilities, our air-traffic control system all of that, increasingly, is dependent on the digital base that they are working off of. And so a lot of concentration there first. And one of the challenges is that a lot of this is private sector the vast bulk of it is private sector. The government has to be able to not only work with each individual company, we have got to be able to pull those companies together so they are working together more effectively. And one of the things that makes this such a challenging problem is, all you need is one weak link. You can have nine companies Well, in any defense. Right. You can have nine companies that have great protocols, authentication systems, you name it. You have one that is not doing a good job, and that penetrates the entire system. So I think everybody recognizes now the degree of seriousness. The key is to coordinate more effectively the legislation that we have put before Congress that, for example, provides companies with some selective liability protections so that when they share information Right. they are not vulnerable to future lawsuits. Those are the kinds of areas where I would like to see us make a lot of progress this year. We talk about North Korea being this bad actor around The Interview. Right. We do our own hacking of other countries. There is been lots of reports about the Iran nuclear system and things like that. Can we make a good argument that we should be protected against them, when we are doing the same thing ourselves? Obviously, I cannot talk about specifics and whether But please do. whether confirming or denying whatever you discuss. I mentioned in the CEO roundtable a comment that was made by one of my national security team. This is more like basketball than football, in the sense that there is no clear line between offense and defense. Things are going back and forth all the time. We have great capabilities here. But there are other countries that have great capabilities, as well. Eventually, what we are going to need to do is to find some international protocols that, in the same way we did with nuclear arms, set some clear limits and guidelines, understanding that everybody's vulnerable and everybody's better off if we abide by certain behaviors. In the meantime, we have to have sufficient capability to defend ourselves. And Is that just defense? Or offense? Well, I will not lie to you, this is a debate that we have internally. Because when you develop sufficient defenses, the same sophistication you need for defenses means that potentially you can engage in offense. Now, there are some things that we are very clear about. For example, we just do not do industrial espionage the way many other countries do, where their state-sponsored operations are going in and stealing information commercially. Mmhm. Most of the work that we do revolves around threats against us from non-state actors, and obviously terrorism is a huge field. And increasingly, cyber terrorism is going to be something that we are concerned about. But we are going to have to build in a whole set of safeguards to make sure that we are upholding high standards if we expect others to do the same. I am going to switch to something else in a second. But should there be a cyber army? Should we our government have this dedicated, the way they do in North Korea or China? Well, what we have is a separate cyber structure, a cyber command that coordinates a lot of this activity, partly because our defense systems today, our armed forces, are dependent on the digital world in the same way that it has penetrated everything else. So this separate cyber command monitors, defends, focuses on protecting not only the Department of Defense and our armed forces, but also critical infrastructure, and is constantly monitoring what other state actors potentially could do. But just to give you a sense of how challenging this is it is not as if North Korea is particularly good at this. They did not bad. But look how much damage they were able to do. Non-state actors can do a lot damage, as well. So we have got to constantly upgrade our game, and that is part of the purpose of this. Are there any countries you are worried about, comparatively? North Korea, not so good. Who is good? Well China and Russia are very good. Iran is good. And, and part of what we need we are constantly engaged in is a dialogue with these countries in the same way that we engage in a dialogue around Nuclear arms nuclear arms, indicating to them that it does not serve anybody's purpose for us to attack in ways that may end up eliciting responses, and everybody's worse off. Let us talk about the relationship between you and Silicon Valley. Lots of discussion about who was not here, and tensions, and sort of, can this marriage be saved? How do you look at your relationship right now with Silicon Valley? They are nervous about the NSA, they are still hurting about that. Visas, Zero-Day flaws, all kinds of things. You know, look. It is your job to generate some controversy, but Now, some controversy Some of those quotes from the Google people are pretty tough. But I think it is also fair to say that my relationship with Silicon Valley and the tech community has historically been really good. Many of these folks are my friends, and have been supporters, and we interact all the time. Well, they are still giving a lot of money to But what is true is that the Snowden disclosures were really harmful in terms of the trust between the government and many of these companies, in part because it had an impact on their bottom lines. Mmhm. You know when you look back at what we have done, I have constantly tried to update the laws and rules governing how we operate in cyberspace with these new technologies. In the case of the NSA, we are probably a little slow. The truth is that what we did with respect to U.S. persons, what we did in this country, was strictly circumscribed. And, generally speaking, I can say with almost complete confidence that there have not been abuses on U.S. soil. But But it is a global Internet world. And that is the point. And they are businesses. And that has been the challenge. What is true and I have said this publicly, so I am not saying anything that is classified in any way our capacities to scoop up information became so great, and traditionally there have not been restraints on our intelligence community scooping up information from outside our borders and non-U.S. persons. So what ended up happening was that, in places like Germany, this had a huge impact not just on government-to-government relations, but suddenly all the Silicon Valley companies that are doing business there find themselves challenged, in some cases not completely sincerely. Because some of those countries have their own companies who want to displace ours. I say all this to make the point that I think we have made real progress in narrowing the differences around the national security/privacy balance. There are still some issues like encryption that are challenging. Let us talk about encryption. That are challenging What is wrong with what Google and Apple are doing? You have encrypted email should not everybody have encrypted email, or have their protections? Everybody should. And I am a strong believer in strong encryption. Where the tension has come up, historically, what has happened, is that let us say you knew a particular person was involved in a terrorist plot. And the FBI is trying to figure out who else were they communicating with, in order to prevent the plot. Traditionally, what has been able to happen is that the FBI gets a court order. They go to the company, they request those records Right. the same way that they'd go get a court order to request a wiretap. Right. The company technically can comply. The issue here is that partly in response to customer demand, partly in response to legitimate concerns about consumer privacy the technologies may be built to a point where, when the government goes to They cannot get the information. The company says, Sorry, we just cannot pull it. It is so sealed and tight that, even though government has a legitimate request, technologically we cannot do it. Is what they are doing wrong? No, I think they are properly responding to a market demand. All of us are really concerned about making sure our So what are you going to do? Well, what we are going to try to do is to see: Is there a way for us to narrow this gap? Ultimately, everybody and certainly this is true for me and my family we all want to know that if we are using a smartphone for transactions, sending messages, having private conversations, that we do not have a bunch of people compromising that process. And so encryption there is no scenario in which we do not want really strong encryption. The narrow question is going to be if there is a proper request for this is not bulk collection, this is not sort of fishing expeditions by government. Where there is a situation in which we are trying to get a specific case of a possible national security threat is there a way of accessing it? If it turns out it is not, then we are really gonna have to have a public debate. And, you know, I think some in Silicon Valley would make the argument which is a fair argument, and I get that the harms done by having any kind of compromised encryption are far greater That is an argument you used to make. Well You would have made. Has something changed with No, I still make it. It is just that I am sympathetic to law enforcement. Because years, you were much stronger on civil liberty. I am as strong as I have been. I think the only concern is our law enforcement is expected to stop every plot. Every attack. Any bomb on a plane. The first time that attack takes place in which it turns out that we had a lead and we could not follow up on it, the public's going to demand answers. And this is a public conversation that we should end up having. I lean probably further in the direction of strong encryption than some do inside of law enforcement. But I am sympathetic to law enforcement because I know the kind of pressure they are under to keep us safe. And it is not as black-and-white as it is sometimes portrayed. Now, in fairness, I think the folks who are in favor of airtight encryption also want to be protected from terrorists. True. So you know, one of the interesting things about being in this job is it does give you a bird's-eye view. You are smack-dab in the middle of these tensions that exist. But I guess what I would say is, there are times where folks who see this through a civil-liberties or privacy lens reject that there is any trade-offs involved, and in fact there are. And you have got to own the fact that it may be we want to value privacy and civil liberty far more than we do Safety. The safety issues. Right But we cannot pretend that there are no trade-offs whatsoever. Let us go quickly into privacy. There is a privacy bill you have all been trying to pass forever, with some teeth in it. Right. Who owns their data? And, on the other side of the companies, have you all acquiesced too far to the Facebooks and Googles of the world, when Europe is being much more stringent? I think you own your data, I think I own my data. I think we own our health-care data, I think we own our financial data. Does not feel like it. Well, and I think this is an area where, ironically, sometimes I also have tensions with Silicon Valley because folks are quite keen on talking about government intrusion. But some of the commercial models that are set up obviously A little intrusive. are fairly intrusive, as well. Right. But they are selling us things. So Yeah, exactly. So, I think part of the answer here is just people knowing ahead of time what is going on. People knowing how their data's being used. Much greater transparency in terms of its potential for migrating over into some sales-and-marketing scheme of somebody else's. And, you know, the more transparent we are, the more customers can make a choice. There are circumstances I will give one specific example that I talked a while back, about when it comes to educational technologies being sold and put into schools. And then it turns out that some kid who is going online to communicate with their teacher their data is going to some marketing company that then sells to the kid. I think that is got to be off-limits. So there are going to be some areas where we just say no, even if the consumer is aware of it ahead of time. But does it have any teeth, really? I mean, Europe is very strong on these things, and doing a lot of investigations into Google and Facebook and other companies. In defense of Google and Facebook, sometimes the European response here is more commercially driven than anything else. As I have said, there are some countries like Germany, given its history with the Stasi, that are very sensitive to these issues. But sometimes their vendors their service providers who, you know, cannot compete with ours are essentially trying to set up some roadblocks for our companies to operate effectively there. Interesting. We have owned the Internet. Our companies, you know, have created it, expanded it, perfected it in ways that they cannot compete. And oftentimes what is portrayed as high-minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed Interesting. to carve out some of their commercial interests. Let us talk about owning it. We have invented the Internet, we have created the most important technology companies. Losing that rapidly to other companies. Education, STEM, visas, all kinds of things, bringing the best talent here. Right now, diversity is another issue, especially women. Right. How do you look at this? How do we change the equation here? Because many people feel that, even though we have got this strong industry, we are losing on lots of ground. First of all, we are not losing it rapidly. But what is true is that our lead will erode if we do not make some good choices now. STEM education, huge priority. Homegrown we have got to have our kids in math and science, and it cannot just be a handful of kids. It is got to be everybody. Everybody's got to learn how to code early. Everybody's got to I saw you were learning to code. Do you encourage your daughters to code? I have, and I have said to Do they? Well, not as much as I would probably like. Although I think they got started a little bit late. Part of what you want to do is introduce this with the ABCs and the colors. And particularly, focusing on girls' participation math, science, technology early is important. Underrepresented groups, African Americans, Latinos. We have got to get those kids tapped in. That is the largest-growing part of our population. If they do not have basic digital literacy What is the problem? I mean, because company after company, 70 percent white, 70 percent male, mostly white, mostly I think part of the problem is, just generally, our school systems are not doing as good of a job on this, period. Full stop. And then part of what is happening is that we are not helping schools and teachers teach it in an interesting way. And what ends up happening is a certain portion of the population just drifts away. Girls, for example we do not lift up models of them being successful in STEM. Somebody, you know, has talked about the degree to which we very rarely see portrayed on television Right female engineers. Yeah. And do not have any jobs, actually. Right. So we just have to we have to lift that stuff up. So that is the long term, getting that whole pool of talent focused. More immediately, we have got an urgent need right now. Comprehensive immigration reform would revise our system so that the best and the brightest from around the world come here, the ones who are studying here are not forced to leave. We have been pushing this hard in Congress. So far, Congress has blocked it. So what do you do? Well, what I did with the executive action that I announced around immigration. There were some areas where I could help to reduce some of the backlog, some of the bureaucracy, make it somewhat easier for talented foreign students to operate here. But we have not gone far enough, and the legislation is what is going to be required. So we have got to keep on pushing on that. You know, overall, though, the good news is that the ecosystem here is so far ahead of anywhere else. There is so much talent, so much brain power, so much financing It still leaves a lot of people out. It well but the point is is that there is so much more room to grow, I guess. It is not as if this is a mature, finite industry where it is a zero-sum game in terms of how many people can be participating. There is a huge possibility for talent not just homegrown from around the world, continuing to converge here in the United States. And it is , look, what used to be primarily Silicon Valley, now it is also Austin, Texas. Well, they are trying. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are a bunch of other places around the country in Utah and others where people are coalescing. I was at Boise, Idaho at Boise State, and they are doing all kinds of interesting stuff in the digital space, connecting universities with companies. So this is something that we want to democratize and see spread all across the country. We are putting together public/private partnerships around, for example, just getting more engineers. You know, we partnered with Intel and a bunch of companies. Are you worried that China and others are graduating more engineers? Yes. Although our engineers are still better. But part of what we need we do not always need the absolute top MIT engineer. Part of what we also need is the standard engineer who can help on a production facility. Because, ironically, part of the reason that some tech production jobs have gone overseas is not so much in search of low wages as it is that there are just more engineers at this production level that can really help. Alright, wrapping up, I want to ask you something about your personal tech habits. Go ahead. I know you watch a lot of sports. I do. Where are you watching things now? Are you watching it on your phone, or do you watch it on television? You know, I will be honest with you When it comes to ballgames, I am still usually watching it on TV DVR. But when it comes to highlights, I am usually watching it on an iPad. On an iPad. And you are still with the BlackBerry, right? I use a BlackBerry mainly because I am so restricted in what I can do Right. that it is basically just messages, Are you going to shift and it is still easier for me to tap off the . But basically most of my non-work-related stuff, I am working off the iPad. And the girls all have iPhones, so I can get around an iPhone pretty good. Do you wear any wearable shirts or health devices, or things like that? Not yet. I think You missed the whole Google Glass thing, by the way. Well, no comment. And what devices do you think you would use once you leave office? I know you like a selfie stick. Well, right. As BuzzFeed showed. Actually, the first time I used that was when we were in Hawaii for vacation. My photographer, Pete Souza, had a GoPro, and folks were starting to use selfie sticks. But do you use any other technology? It is just basically the iPad? It is basically the iPad, although I do not have a Fitbit yet, but I work out hard. Word is that these Apple watches might be a good companion for my workout. So I am going to see. I am going to test it out. Alright. I do not want to give Tim Cook too big of a plug here Yeah. But you just did. until I have actually seen the product. But he tells me it is pretty good. Absolutely. Last question: If there was a hashtag for your administration, what would it be? YesWeCan. Naturally. Thank you so much. Great to talk to you.

{"id": 377, "text": "ENTITY, is there anything you can tell us on the record concerning the visit of your various power officials here today? They are members of a committee, I could not tell you the name of it, that has on it somebody from the Federal Trade Commission, somebody from T.V.A., somebody from Interior and one or two from the Power Commission. They have been working- I think the whole thing came out last spring-on a general survey of the power situation, and they are going to talk with me about that tonight. Is that your National Resources Committee? No, it is separate from that. It relates only to power. It is one of the inter-departmental committees to report on the general situation. With recommendations for legislation? Yes, and policy. Still on the record, does that visit here mean that you have in mind any new moves of a concrete nature in the immediate future in connection with what you were telling us the other day? This has nothing to do with the trip or T.V.A. or anything like that, except in so far as it relates to general power policy. . . . I feel I am doing a lot of talking here, but the other day you spoke of power and there are a lot of interpretations on it. Purely . . . Oh, the interpretations are all pure. Do you mind telling us what your ideas are regarding private power companies? All right, I shall give you something on that, but this has to be off the record because I do not want to be in the position of interpreting what I said. It is a perfectly simple thing. Two years ago, in this room, you were here, Fred . . . We spent an hour and a half. I think it was in January, 1933, and we had been down with Norris to see the Wilson Dam. And I had said up there publicly that we were going ahead with the development of Muscle Shoals. That is all I said at that time publicly. We came down here and we had this talk in which I outlined what developed into T.V.A. . . . I can put it this way: Power is really a secondary matter. What we are doing there is taking a watershed with about three and a half million people in it, almost all of them rural, and we are trying to make a different type of citizen out of them from what they would be under their present conditions. Now, that applies not only to the mountaineers-we all know about them-but it applies to the people around Muscle Shoals. Do you remember that drive over to Wheeler Dam the other day? You went through a county of Alabama where the standards of education are lower than almost any other county in the United States, and yet that is within twenty miles of the Muscle Shoals Dam. They have never had a chance. All you had to do was to look at the houses in which they lived. Heavens, this section around here is 1,000 percent compared with that section we went through. The homes through here are infinitely better. So T.V.A. is primarily intended to change and to improve the standards of living of the people of that valley. Power is, as I said, a secondary consideration. Of course it is an important one because, if you can get cheap power to those people, you hasten the process of raising the standard of living. The T.V.A. has been going ahead with power, yes, but it has been going ahead with probably a great many other things besides power and dam building. For instance, take fertilizer. You talk about a yardstick of power. Dr. H. A. Morgan is running the fertilizer end of it and at Muscle Shoals he is turning out, not a nitrate-the plant was originally built for a nitrate plant-but he is turning out a phosphate. He is conducting a very fine experiment with phosphate of lime. They believe that for this whole area around here, and that would include this kind of soil around here, phosphate of lime is the best thing you can put on land in addition to being the cheapest. Now at once, the fertilizer companies, the National Fertilizer Association that gets out figures , say, Are you going into the fertilizer business? The answer is a very simple one. The plant is primarily an experimental plant. That is the primary purpose. Therefore, they are going to take this year a thousand acres of Government land, worn-out land typical of the locality, and they are going to use this phosphate of lime on these thousand acres and show what can be done with the land. They are going to give a definite demonstration. They will compare it with the other fertilizers, putting them in parallel strips, and they will see which works out best and at the lowest cost. Having the large plant, they will be able to figure out what is a fair price for the best type of fertilizer. Having done that and having figured out the fair price, it becomes a process of education. If the farmers all through that area can be taught that that type of fertilizer at x number of dollars a ton is the best thing for them to use, then it is up to the National Fertilizer Association and its affiliated companies to meet that price. Now, that is the real answer, and we hope that they will meet that price, adding to the cost of manufacture a reasonable profit. We shall know what the cost of manufacture is, and it is very easy to say what a reasonable profit is. Now, if those gentlemen fail to avail themselves of this magnificent opportunity to conduct a sound business and make a profit, well, it is just too bad. Then somebody will get up in Congress and say, These fellows are not meeting their opportunities and the farmers will have to have the fertilizer and of course we shall have to provide it. But I, for one, hope that that day will never come. Now, that is not holding a big stick over them at all. It is saying to them, Here is your opportunity. We go down on our knees to you, asking you to take it. just a little guiding light. In other words, what we are trying to do is something constructive to enable business . . . No, it is not even an intimation. No, it is a generous offer. Now, coming down to power. You take the example of Corinth we went through the other day. In Corinth, without Government assistance- they did it themselves-they had a county electric-power association and they used to buy their juice from the Mississippi Power Company. Because they were on a through line to Tupelo, the T.V.A. came along and stepped in as a middleman, and still bought the power from the Mississippi Power Company at a lower cost per kilowatt on the agreement with the Mississippi Power Company that it would take more juice. The result was that the Mississippi Power Company gets the same gross profit as it was getting before, but it is selling more power. Then the T.V.A., merely acting as middleman without any profit to itself, turns around and sells it to the county electric-power association. That part of it does not change the existing situation at all. The Mississippi Power Company merely gave a lower rate to the Alcorn County people, but it did it via the T.V.A., instead of direct. It was merely a bookkeeping matter. It does not cost the T.V.A. anything, and it does not receive anything. Now the Alcorn County people, that is the Alcorn County Electric Power Association, did a very interesting thing. There they had Corinth, which is a good-sized town, and they found they could distribute in Corinth-these are not accurate figures-they found they could distribute household power at about two cents a kilowatt hour. But if they were to run an electric line out to a farm, they would have to charge three cents. In other words, the farmer would have had to pay more. What did the Corinth people do? They said, We can get cheaper power than the farmer, but we think he should have the same rates we are getting. Voluntarily they agreed to take and to pay for two-and-a-half-cent power which enabled the farmer to get two-and-a-half-cent power. That is an extraordinary thing. That is community planning. Now, there was no reason in God's world why the Mississippi Power Company could not have gone to Corinth and said the same thing-no reason in the world. It just never thought of it. It could have done that same thing. But it was the T.V.A. that went down and sold the idea to the people in that county and said, Let us have a uniform power rate for the man next to the powerhouse and the same rate for the man who lives twenty-five miles up the Valley. We do not want to concentrate any more people in Corinth. We want to increase the rural population. The result of that operation is that they are increasing-they have more nearly doubled the consumption of power. Furthermore, they have gone ahead and formed another association, tied up with this county one, by which people can buy refrigerators and electric cookstoves and all the other gadgets at a figure which is somewhere around 60 or 70 percent of what they were paying before. Now, the process behind what they were paying before amounted to this: A subsidiary of the Mississippi Power Company in the business of selling refrigerators, generally owned -I am just saying this as a mean aside- generally owned by a son of a president of a power company-there is a lot of that nepotism-would go around and say, We will sell you a refrigerator. The cost is two hundred dollars. You can pay for it over thirty months. The total cost to you at the end of thirty months will be three hundred dollars. In other words, it was a hundred dollars extra for instalment payments. It did not say that, but that is what it amounted to. In other words, it was selling them the thing at two hundred dollars, and it was making an average of 18 to 20 percent on that sale during this thirty months. Now, who else profits? That selling corporation, of course, made not only its 15 or 20 percent, but also made quite a lot on what it had paid for the machine. It had probably paid a hundred and seventy-five dollars for the machine, so it made twenty-five dollars on the machine. Now, whom did it buy it from? It did not buy it from the General Electric or the Westinghouse. It bought it from the middleman, and he also made a twenty-five-dollar profit on it, and the General Electric Company got only a hundred and fifty dollars for the machine. Therefore, when the consumer paid three hundred dollars, it was just 100 percent more than the General Electric Company got for the machine. We went to the General Electric Company and said, Will you give us your wholesale rate on machines? It said, Sure. And we went to all the other refrigerator manufacturers so as to have a complete line, and then we said to the householder, You can buy this for a hundred and fifty dollars plus a five-dollar handling charge, paying for it over thirty months at 5 percent interest instead of 18 percent. The net result is that instead of paying three hundred dollars, he pays a hundred and seventy-five or a hundred and eighty dollars. His instalment cost is at 5 percent instead of 18 percent. He gets it at the wholesale price, which the Mississippi Power Company could have done exactly as well as the T.V.A. In other words, we are teaching him something. Whom is Corinth getting its power from now? Mississippi Power Company. I do not quite understand the power company getting its same profit. Mr. Ruble, who runs a department store down there, told us that the building had its bill cut from sixty dollars a month to forty dollars and he doubled his consumption. That is the point; what does it do? Suppose it were selling-well, let us put it in algebra. Suppose it were selling x kilowatt hours times y cents per kilowatt hour. The total receipts of the company amounted to z. Now, we come in and tell these local people that if they will buy 2x kilowatts times 1/2 y-in other words, half the price-you will still have z. In other words, if they buy twice as much power at half the cost, the gross will be exactly the same at the end of the month. Now, that is what we have been trying to do. I do not know the consumption back in Corinth, but in Tupelo we estimated it would take a year at a three-cent rate running down to one, instead of a rate starting at six cents and running down to three. We figured it would take a year for the consumption of power to double. Actually, it took only four months. The consumption of power in Tupelo has doubled in four months. The result is that the local company has an even bigger gross in the way of receipts than it had before, and yet the consumers of that power, whether shopkeepers or farmers or householders or anything else, are getting their electricity for less than half the price-about 45 percent-of what they were paying before. Is not there a considerable change in the cost of having to step up its power production to meet a demand like that? Very little. The only overhead is when you get an extension of rural lines. There you have a larger inspection force to watch the lines. That is about all. Then we are doing a third thing along the same lines. The power companies did a silly thing when it came to rural electrification. They put out all kinds of specifications for rural lines that were out of the question. There was a certain rural line we wanted here in Warm Springs, and the specifications of the power company, as I remember them, called for thirty-five-foot poles, white oak, that had to come from North Georgia. They had to be hauled here by railroad. Then I think it charged eighty dollars for the transmission line into the farmhouse. The net result is that a line for five or six farmers would cost somewhere on the average of four or five hundred dollars. That is a pretty big debt for a farmer to assume. Then it said to him, along the same line as the refrigerator, You can pay that over a number of years with a small charge for interest. The interest ran from 18 to 20 percent. What we are trying to do is to build a rural line which will be substantial. We will put in transformers, actually at cost from the electric supply company, the General Electric Company or the Westinghouse, and then let the farmer pay for his power line at 5 percent instead of 18 or 20 percent. It means that on the average he can put in his power line for about 60 percent of what it costs the other way. Now, we come back to the old simile we used before. I hope that the proper power-company officials will accept this free education that the Government is giving them. It is a fine offer and a grand chance. If they come in and do it right with a reasonable profit on their actual cost, that is all we are asking. No threat. . . . Or else? No or else. . . . In Atlanta the Georgia Power Company runs its auxiliary plant in Atlanta with gas. It buys gas from Mississippi, makes electricity from the gas-converts the gas into electricity- and sells it at a profit. It uses about twenty million cubic feet a day. Do you know, about gas-Ickes told me this on the train the other day- there is going to waste every year in the Texas oil fields $72,000,000 worth of gas. It is just escaping into the air. Now, if that gas were turned into electricity, think what it would mean to Texas. That is $6,000,000 worth of gas a month. They pipe the gas into Atlanta from Mississippi. If that much is going to waste in Texas, what is the gas wasted on Capitol Hill? That would run the District, anyway. It might cut the District tax rate. The trouble is that that is nonconvertible gas. Now, coming back to the point, this statement shows a balance available for construction and retirement of 35 percent of the gross. If you were to analyze the financing of most of the private power companies, you will find that in the majority of cases they have been following the pernicious rule of the railroads. They get out a twenty- or thirty-year bond issue and they do not start a sinking fund. When the bonds mature they do not pay them off. For example, in the paper yesterday morning, there is one company that is seeking to refund an issue of bonds which were issued twenty years ago. That is what has hurt the railroads. The railroads never paid off a single' bond which had matured. They never set up a sinking fund. . . . The logical question that that raises is, can the average private utilities undergo the reorganization necessary to cut the rates and take advantage of the opportunity given them? Only if they reorganize. Of course, we all know they do a lot of talking about widows and orphans. Now, whose fault is it? I will give you an example: A certain friend of mine, who makes or perhaps saves two or three thousand dollars a year, started in about 1928 to put aside a savings fund, realizing that some day he would get old and could not work any more. Wanting a little more than 4 percent, he went to two banks in New York City, the most reputable, oldfashioned banks he could find. I was partly responsible and told him where to go. As a result, today he finds that the fifteen or twenty thousand dollars he put in is invested, about two-thirds, in bonds of utilities, not stocks but bonds. What kind of utilities? Holding companies, all of them holding companies, none of them operating companies. He was advised to buy the bonds of these holding companies as the best form of investment he could get. They were 6 percent and 7 percent bonds and he bought them at 102, 103 and 104. He bought them above par. Today the average of those bonds is about 40. The result is that he has lost over half of the savings that he put into those bonds. Now, why are they selling at 40? For the simple reason that you have to find out what is behind them. That starts you back over a chain. Let us take Associated Gas & Electric, as an example, or Commonwealth & Southern, or any of the big holding companies. Those bonds have printed on them that behind them is so much stock. Let us call the first company the A Company, and its bonds state that it has so much stock of B Company, C Company, D Company, in the treasury of the A Company, as security for those bonds. Then you analyze and you ask, what is the common stock of B, C and D Companies? You will find that they are holding companies. And you will also find that they have outstanding certain bonds which are backed by the common stocks of E, F, G, H and I Companies. And then you will come down to those companies and perhaps they are operating companies or perhaps they are holding companies too. Sometimes you get the pyramid of the holding company principle up to the fourth dimension. . . . The banker who does the merging gets a lot of common stock, and dumps it off on the market. Now what Charlie said was right. I do not like the expression squeezing the water out, but if the utility companies in this country could recapitalize on the basis of the money put into them, every one of them would be making a profit today and every one of them could reduce the rates. But a lot of people have taken their money and gotten out. And a lot of widows and orphans are holding the bag, having been persuaded by the best banks in New York City to buy that kind of bonds, which is not at all honest. The answer is that they hold the bag anyway, so that in reorganization it would not make any difference. In a reorganization it is just too bad about people badly advised. It is not the Government's fault. In other words, somebody is bound to get hurt. There is not any question about it. It is a very simple proposition. Suppose, for the sake of argument, you can save the consumers of power one hundred million dollars at the rate of two hundred dollars a year. That would be five hundred thousand people who would benefit in a year. They would benefit from that kind of saving through cheaper power. You would hurt a lot of people. You might hurt twenty or thirty or forty thousand people in materially benefiting five hundred thousand. But, after all, that is one thing that Government cannot do, and that is to protect widows and orphans against bad advice they have had on investing. . . . To give you a thought, what we are after primarily is to improve the standard of living for the country as a whole. And power is merely one of the things? Merely one of the things. Better homes, slum clearance, better roads, they all tie in together. Better education is very, very important. . . . Do you think it is necessary to go ahead with the Tennessee Valley experiment on a national scale to bring about the plans you have outlined? Not the same kind of governmental power development if the other fellows will do it. They have every chance in the world to do it. You take a simple example: Eight miles over here to the eastward is a place called the Cove where they make the best corn liquor in Georgia. The best is none too good. Throw him out. Now, in the Cove the Georgia Power Company owns one of the most favorable power sites in the State. It can turn out at that power site something between forty and fifty thousand kilowatts at a cost of less than half a cent. It has owned it for fifteen years and it bought the whole power site for a total of fifteen thousand dollars. In other words, it bought it as a farm lot. It has sought in other years to carry it on its books for a million dollars. It is an undeveloped power site and I think the old Public Service Commission of this State allowed it to do it for a while. Farther up, where we are going to picnic, is a place where it can develop 30,000 kilowatts, and I think it paid fifteen or eighteen thousand dollars for all the land comprising that site. It has a grand chance to make cheap electricity for the whole region and we are just giving it the opportunity as well as showing it how. None of this, I take it, is on the record. No, it is just so that when you talk about it in the future you will know all about it. Cannot we write this as background? I think not. You had better keep it. If you write anything at all it will look like trying to explain something. . . . Cannot we use this, what you said this afternoon about Tennessee Valley and before-cannot we use that? Instead of using it right now, jot your notes down and let me give you a hint. The National Resources Board preliminary report is coming out, and it ties right in with it. Let me dig that up for you. Do not use it today-use it for a Sunday story or a Monday story. These notes are worth a thousand dollars at least, minimum. ENTITY; Wait until you learn more about it. You do not know enough about it to write a story. . . . ENTITY, if you were going to write a story today for the morning papers, what would you write? I would write that the power people were all down here and were discussing power policy and legislation, just a preliminary talk.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsfromthepressconferencewarmspringsga", "title": "Excerpts from the Press Conference in Warm Springs, Ga", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/excerpts-from-the-press-conference-warm-springs-ga", "publication_date": "23-11-1934", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 237, "text": "ENTITY, we cannot say thank you enough for giving NPR this time, so thank you. You bet. All right, ENTITY, the reports that 300 militants were killed, an American helicopter shot down yesterday in Najaf - that is one of the deadliest battles of the war, what can you tell us? You know, ENTITY, I have not been briefed by the Pentagon yet. One of the things I have learned is not to react to first reports off the battlefield. I will tell you, though, that this fight is an indication of what is taking place, and that is the Iraqis are beginning to take the lead, whether it be this fight that you have just reported on where the Iraqis went in with American help to do in some extremists that were trying to stop the advance of their democracy, or the report that there is militant Shia had been captured or killed. In other words, one of the things that I expect to see is the Iraqis take the lead and show the American people that they are willing to the hard work necessary to secure their democracy, and our job is to help them. So my first reaction on this report from the battlefield is that the Iraqis are beginning to show me something. Well, now, one of the concerns might be that you have - the gunmen were trying to assassinate clerics and pilgrims - Shia pilgrims. So I am wondering if that is an indication of a civil war - a term that, you know, you have been reluctant to use. Well, I think it is an indication that there are murderers who will kill innocent people to stop the advance of a form of government that is the opposite of what they believe. You know, we can debate terms, but what cannot be debated is the fact that Iraq is violent, and the violence is caused by Sunni Arabs like al-Qaida, who have made it clear that they want to create chaos and drive the United States out so they can have safe haven, and then they could launch attacks against America. No question the attack on the Golden Mosque of Samarra, which is a Shia holy site, caused Shia extremists to retaliate. Now, there is some criminality going on, ENTITY, when there is no push-back in society; criminals are able to - you know, to have their way, and now the question is whether or not it is worth it in our interest - whether it is in the interests of the United States to help the Iraqi government do what is necessary to deal with these extremists. And I have obviously made the decision, I think it is. I fully understand it is going to be up to the Iraqis to solve their problems. I was hoping to be in a different position. In other words, I had hoped I'd be able to interview with you and say, well, you know, we are not needed as much anymore, but I fully recognize that unless the violence in Baghdad, the capital city of Iraq, the sectarian violence and the criminality is dealt with, then the political reconciliation necessary to unite the country is not going to happen. And so I made a tough decision, and that is to reinforce our troops there and put a new commander there in the hopes of breaking the sectarian violence - or helping the Iraqis break it. Now, you have got a vote tomorrow in the Senate to consider a resolution opposing the troop buildup. Vice President Cheney said last week that vote would validate the insurgents' strategy. And so, do you agree? Well, there is a lot of strong opinions about it. My attitude is - my feeling to the Senate echoes what Joe Lieberman said the other day - Senator Joe Lieberman - and that is it is ironic that the Senate would vote 81 to nothing to send a general into Iraq who believes he needs more troops to do the job and then send a contradictory message. The legislatures will - legislators will do what they feel like they have got to do, and, you know, we want to work with them as best we can to make it clear what the stakes of failure will be, and also make it clear to them that I think they have a responsibility to make sure our troops have what they need to do the missions. Well, another question about Vice President Cheney - he said last week that - here I am quoting - we have encountered enormous successes and we continue to have enormous successes in Iraq. Two weeks ago you said, quote, there had not been enough success in Iraq. So it sounds like there is a conflicting message there. Oh, I do not think so. I think that the vice president is a person reflecting a half-glass-full mentality, and that is he is been able to look at - as have I, and I hope other Americans have - the fact that the tyrant was removed, 12 million people voted, there is an Iraqi constitution in place that is a model for - and unique for the Middle East. I will tell you, 2005 was a great year for freedom, and then the enemy took a good look and said, what do we need to do to stop the advance of freedom, and 2006 was a tough year. And I have said that the progress is not good enough. In other words, people have asked me about whether or not I approve of the situation in Iraq and my answer is no. We can do better, but it is going to require an Iraqi government that does several things. One is provide security for its people, and therefore it is in our interest to train with them, to embed with them, and to fight alongside them for a period of time until Baghdad is secure. Two, they have got to reconcile. In other words, they have got to make it clear to the 12 million people that made a conscious decision to vote and say, we want a unity government, to reach out to disparate elements. They have got to make sure that oil revenue, for example, is available to all of the people and not just a faction that may happen to be in power. They have got to make sure that those who were involved with the Saddam government in the past, so long as they were not killers or terrorists, have a chance, for example, to be reinstated as school teachers. In other words, there is a lot of things politically that can happen, ENTITY, and - you know, I made a decision that - and, listen, I listen to a lot of folks here in Washington. I listen to the military people, I listen to people who are critical of the policy, I listen to Republicans, I listen to Democrats, and I listen carefully for which strategy would yield - would most likely yield success, and the one I picked is the one I believe will. And I understand it is controversial and I understand people are skeptical, and I understand there is pessimism here. I also want your listeners to know that a lot of people here in Washington also understand that failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the Iraqi people and for the American people. But there is no distance between you and Vice President Cheney in terms of the strength of his resolve that things are going, as he put it, you know, successfully. Well, we both agree that something needed to change. In other words, when I made the decision to change the strategy in Iraq with a focus on Baghdad - in other words, reinforcing our troops, he fully understands that needed to happen and supported it. All right. You know, people are praying for you; people - the American people want to be with you, ENTITY, but you just spoke about the polls and they indicate the public - and you know about what is going up on Capitol Hill with the Congress, some in the military. Even many Iraqis, according to the polls, do not like the idea of sending more troops into Iraq. So I wonder if you could give us something to go on, give us something - say, you know, this is a reason to get behind the ENTITY right now. Well, one way to - and one of the things I have found here in Washington amongst those who were skeptical about whether the Iraqis will do what it takes to secure their own freedom, is to remind them of what would happen if there is failure. In other words, there would be chaos. If we did not work to secure Baghdad and help the Iraqis to secure Baghdad, the country could evolve into a chaotic situation, and out of that chaos would emerge an emboldened enemy. See, the difference, ENTITY, between other conflicts in the past and this one is that failure would endanger the homeland. In other words, the enemy is not going to be just contained in the Middle East if they succeed in driving us out or succeed in wrecking the Iraqi democracy. The enemy would be likely to follow us here. And that is why I tried in my State of the Union speech, why I reminded people that September the - the lessons of September the 11th need to be remembered. It is a - and look, September the 11th changed my attitude about a lot of things. It really did. And I recognize that the world we live in is one where America cannot be isolated from the ills in other parts of the world. As a matter of fact, those ills can come home to haunt us. And so, as I said in my speech, we will do everything we can to protect the American people, and continue to stay on the offense, but we have also got to defeat the ideology of hate with an ideology of liberty, because in the long run it is going to secure peace for your children and grandchildren. How long can you sustain the policy, though, with people so vehement in their doubt, the Congress voting as the Congress is voting, the polls showing what they are showing? Yeah. Well, I am - you know, I am hopeful that the decision I have made is going to yield enough results so that the Iraqi government is able to take more of the responsibility. Listen, they want the responsibility. You have heard their prime minister say, we are ready to go. And in my judgment, and more importantly, the judgment of the military folks, they are not quite ready to go. And therefore, it is in our interest to help them with an additional 21,000 troops, particularly in Baghdad, to help bring this violence down and to deal with these radicals, whether they be Sunni radicals or Shia radicals. And, you know, I am reluctant to put timetables on the situation because there are people who listen to what I say and others in America say, and are willing to adjust their timetables to our timetable. It is a - I am optimistic, I am realistic, I understand how tough the fight is, but I also understand the stakes, and it is very important for our citizens to understand that a Middle East could evolve in which rival forms of extremists compete with each other, you know, nuclear weapons become developed, safe havens are in place, oil would be used as an economic weapon against the West. And I am confident that if this were to happen, people would look back at this year and say, what happened to those people in 2006? How come they could not see the impending threat? All right. You know, you mentioned timetables. NPR has a reporter embedded with the Minnesota National Guard in Iraq, and one of the soldiers there asked the question - says, my name is Specialist Ryan Schmidt from Forest Lake, Minnesota, and my question for you, ENTITY, is what if your plan for a troop surge to Baghdad does not work? What do you think? Well, I would say to Ryan, I put it in place on the advice of a lot of smart people, particularly the military people who think it will work, and let us go into this aspect of the Iraqi strategy feeling it will work. But I will also assure Ryan that we are constantly adjusting to conditions on the ground. Let us talk about Iran for a second, ENTITY. And let me also say to Ryan, thanks for serving. I mean, one of the amazing things about our country is that we have people who volunteer to go. And one of the things I look for is whether or not we are able to recruit and retain, and we are. And it is a remarkable country, ENTITY, where people are saying I want to serve. And I appreciate that soldier, and I hope this message gets to him that not only do I appreciate him, but a lot of Americans appreciate him. We will get it to him, ENTITY. Iran's ambassador to Iraq says Iran is planning to greatly expand its economic and military ties with Iran - with Iraq. You said you have proof of Iran's role in attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. I know you want to take care of this diplomatically - I have heard you say that - but if Iran escalates its military action in Iraq, how will the U.S. respond? If Iran escalates its military action in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and/or innocent Iraqi people, we will respond firmly. We - it makes common sense for the commander-in-chief to say to our troops and the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government that we will help you defend yourself from people that want to sow discord and harm. And so we will do what it takes to protect our troops. One of the things that is very important in discussing Iran is not to mix issues. Our relationship with Iran is based upon a lot of different issues. One is what is happening in Iraq. Another is their ambitions to have a nuclear weapon. And we are dealing with this issue diplomatically, and I think this can be solved diplomatically. And the message that we are working to send to the Iranian regime and the Iranian people is that you will become increasingly isolated if you continue to pursue a nuclear weapon. The message to the Iranian people is that your government is going to cause you deprivation. In other words, you have got a chance to really flourish again as a great tradition. However, if your government continues to insist upon a nuclear weapon, there will be lost opportunity for the Iranian people. They will not be able to realize their full potential. The Iranian people have got to know that this government and the United States bears no hostility to them. We are just deeply concerned about a government that is insisting upon having a nuclear weapon, and at the same time, rewriting history - the history of the past, and regards, for example, the Holocaust. It troubles a lot of people in this world, and I will continue to work with, you know, friends and allies to send a clear message. By the way, just quickly, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader says that if you have an incursion into Iran, he expects that you would come to the Senate for approval. I have no intent upon incur-going into Iran. I mean, this is the kind of thing that happens in Washington. People ascribe, you know, motives to me beyond a simple statement - of course we will protect our troops. I do not know how anybody can then say, well, protecting the troops means that we are going to invade Iran. If that is what he is talking about, there is - I mean, we will protect our interests in Iraq. That is what the American people expect us to do. That is definitely what our troops want to do, and that is what the families of our troops want us to do. And if we find the Iranians are moving weapons that will end up harming American troops, we will deal with it. Let us talk for a second about the State of the Union speech. You did not mention Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, or the Gulf Coast. A lot of people from Louisiana, including David Vitter, the Republican senator, say they regret that. Do you? Well, I gave a speech that I thought was necessary to give. On the other hand, I had been talking a lot about Katrina and about the fact that I worked with the Congress to get about $110 billion sent down to both Mississippi and Louisiana to help them on their reconstruction efforts. Obviously, there is more work to be done. But to take the housing issue, for example, we have sent money down to the Louisiana folks, Louisiana Recovery Authority, to fund their plan. And the money is there and the money is available. And now it is up to the folks down there to get this plan implemented so people can start rebuilding their houses. If there is bureaucratic slowdowns in Washington, we have got a man named Don Powell who is working to address them. But no, our response to the Katrina recovery has been very robust. And I appreciate the taxpayers of the United States helping the folks down there in Mississippi and Louisiana. Now, also in the State of the Union, you talked about the - quote here - the serious challenge of global climate change. Were you talking about global warming there? Absolutely, and it is a serious challenge. And one of the things that I am proud of is this administration has done a lot on advancing new technologies that will enable us to do two things - strengthen our economy, and at the same time, be better stewards of the environment. In 2002, I talked about an energy efficiency standard, which says new technologies will enable us to grow our economy, and at the same time, improve the environment, and we are meeting certain standards that I set for the country. And what kind of technologies? Well, if you are really interested in global warming and climate change, then it seems like to me that we ought to promote technologies to advance the development of safe nuclear power. It is a renewable source of energy, and at the same time has no emissions to it. But also, we are advancing clean-coal technologies. The goal is to have a zero-emission coal-fired plant. And then, in the State of the Union, I talked about another aspect of economic security and environmental quality, and that is changing the habits - or changing how we power our cars. And I want more people driving automobiles with, you know, ethanol, for example, or biodiesel. And I believe the goal I set, which is a very bold goal, of reducing gasoline usage by 20 percent in 10 years is an attainable goal, but it is going to require the Congress funding the research and development initiatives that I have put in my budgets. And I expect them to do so. By the way, in the speech, you spoke about the Democrats. You said, you congratulated the Democrat majority. And I notice your prepared text said Democratic majority. I surely think that you know that for the Democrats, they think when you say Democrat, it is like fingernails on the blackboard. They do not like it. They like you to say Democratic. Yeah. Well, that was an oversight then. I mean, I am not trying to needle. Look, I went into the hall saying we can work together and I was very sincere about it. I did not even know I did it. OK. And that I did, I did not mean to be putting fingernails on the board, I meant to be saying why do not we show the American people we can actually work together? There is a lot of politics in Washington - in my judgment, needless politics. And it is almost like, if ENTITY is for it, we are against it, and I - and if he is against it, we are for it. And the American people do not like that. And I am going to tell you some big issues we need to work on. One is entitlements. Your grandchildren are going to grow up with a Social Security system that is broke unless we do something about it. Now, I understand how hard that is. I mean, it is -But the solution can be done. But it requires a lot of political, you know, capital to be spent. And there is distrust in Washington. I am surprised, frankly, at the amount of distrust that exists in this town. And I am sorry it is the case, and I will work hard to try to elevate it. So the idea that somehow I was trying to needle the Democrats, it is just - gosh, it is probably Texas. Who knows what it is. But I am not that good at pronouncing words anyway, ENTITY. ENTITY, you are bringing out a new budget next week, and I presume you are going to have healthcare, health insurance plan in it. To pay for some of the plan, some people who do not pay taxes on their health insurance plan now will have to pay taxes. Is not that a tax increase for them? No, really what it is, it is a rewriting of the tax code. We have got a tax code today that says if you get your insurance from a large employer, for example, it is part of your - it is a non-taxable event. And yet if you are an individual, like ENTITY out there as an independent contractor, and you buy your own health insurance, you are at a tax disadvantage. And so I am asking the Congress to reform the tax code to treat everybody fairly. And in my judgment, such a plan will encourage and enable more individuals to be able to buy health insurance, which will help us deal with the uninsured. Will the budget be balanced through spending restraint or taxes? The budget is going to be balanced by keeping taxes low. In other words, we are not going to raise taxes. And as a result of keeping taxes low, the economy is doing just fine, and when the economy is doing well, it yields a certain level of tax revenues that we can live with. And then making sure that we constrain federal spending, and you do that by setting priorities. And our priority has got to be this global war on terror and supporting our troops, and protecting the homeland, and that is what our budget will say, and we can balance the budget within five years. And that is going to be - that is good for the country. And in so doing, we are dealing with the short-term deficits, but we have also got to deal with the long-term deficits inherent in, for example, programs like Social Security and Medicare. So, some people would say, well, if you believe in spending restraint, why have not you vetoed one bill, you know, one appropriations bill? Because the United States Congress that was controlled by Republicans exercised spending restraint. Now, I did not particularly like - the size of the pie was what I requested. It is some of the pieces of the pie that I did not particularly care for, but that is why the ENTITY needs a line-item veto, and that is why Congress has got to reform the earmark process. What the American people need to understand is that sometimes special projects get put into bills without ever having seen the light of the day. In other words, they do not get voted on; they just show up, and we need transparency in the earmark process, and expose the process to hearings and votes so that the American people will know that any project was fully heard on the floor of the House and the Senate. ENTITY, you have talked about Harry Truman and the challenges that President Truman faced during his time here. He was not popular toward the end of his presidency, but history ended up judging him very well. Is that your hope now? Well, you know, ENTITY, my hope is that we see improvement in Baghdad. My vision is dealing with the problems at hand. I have got a lot on my agenda and believe we are going to get a lot done. At home, we want the economy to remain strong, and we want our children educated. That is why I am pushing for a reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act. And abroad, I am not only working with a great team to deal with Iraq, but we are dealing with Iran, Middle Eastern peace, North Korea. I mean, there is a lot of issues we are dealing with. My own view is that history will take care of itself. History has a long reach to it. I told people that last year I read three analyses of Washington's administration, and my attitude is if they are still writing about the first ENTITY, the 43rd does not need to worry about it. And so, the other thing is, is that, I think it is very important for people - for a ENTITY to make decisions based upon principles. You know, you can be popular, but you may be wrong. And I would rather, when it is all said and done, get back home and look in the mirror and say, I did not compromise the principles that are etched into my soul in order to be a popular guy. What I want to do is solve problems for the American people and yield the peace that we all want. One last thing, ENTITY. When you look at the quality of intelligence that you are getting about the nuclear program in Iran right now, do you think it is better than the quality of intelligence you were getting about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? No question that there is a certain skepticism about intelligence. We all thought that that - that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and we all being not only the administration, but members from both political parties in the Congress. The previous administration felt that the intelligence indicated there was weapons of mass destruction. The international community - in other words, I just want you to know that there was a universal belief that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction including critics of Iraq, like the French, who voted for 1441 in the Security Council. And therefore when it turned out not to be true, there is a certain skepticism about intel. And however, the skepticism about intel, while it needs to be tempered by, you know, the - by an analysis of statements or other fragments of intelligence - what I am trying to say that I take the Iranian nuclear threat very seriously even though the intel on Iraq was not what it was thought to be, and we have to. Now - so how do you solve the problem on intel? Well, you get more human intelligence. You constantly reevaluate the system itself and make sure that these really fine souls that work for the different intelligence agencies are given the tools they need. And so - look, I am like a lot of Americans that say, well, if it was not right in Iraq, how do you know it is right in Iran? And so we are constantly evaluating, and answering this legitimate question by always working to get as good intelligence as we can. And Negroponte's departure, did it concern you - do you feel like the CIA, all of these intelligence agencies are doing a better job now? Well, I think they understand the lessons of Iraq. And you know, we put the Silverman Robb Commission together, and wanted to make - look, the ENTITY needs the best intelligence. This is a war against a group of killers that still want to come and kill us, that is going to require accurate intelligence to give us the data necessary to act to protect Americans before the attack. And therefore we are all pulling for good intelligence. And Negroponte is much needed at the State Department. He is one of these public servants who brings a lot of skills, and a lot of really - and a lot of good judgment. And I asked him to go to the State Department to help Condi, and found a very suitable replacement, a guy named Mike McConnell. And the change of personnel really is not a reflection upon whether or not the intel is getting better or worse; the change of personnel is putting our best players in the best positions as we head into the final two years of the administration. One last thing, ENTITY, with the Democrats. You asked the Democrats on a bipartisan basis to form an advisory council and monitor the war, work with you. They have not responded at all. What do you take from that? Well, I am going to have to keep working with them and explain that my notion is to - is to put in place a consulting-type group that will be able to talk about the war on terror in general. In other words, I do not want - I think that a lot of these folks are not happy we are in Iraq to begin with, and I understand that, and then they are - they do not believe we are going to succeed in Iraq, and I understand that too. I think what some may be afraid of is I am trying to get them into an Iraq-type situation where they are forced to say something they do not want to say. I do not know. Oh, that they would be co-opted by cooperating or working with you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and that may be part of the issue. My purpose really is to - listen, we want to consult in Iraq, and we will continue to do so, and we will be very much involved with members of Congress, do not get me wrong. But the greater purpose is to help this country succeed in the ideological struggle that we are going to be in today and tomorrow and the next day. This is - what I am describing to the American people is this war on terror is going to take a while, and Iraq is just a part of it. And I guess - you know, I am going to work - I think it is important for me to continue to reach out to the Democrats, and will - and Republicans, for that matter - and explain the strategies and the way forward, but also to explain to them that presidents and Congresses will be dealing with this ideological struggle for quite a while, and therefore it makes sense to work together now to help not only us succeed, but help them succeed. ENTITY, I want say thank you from National Public Radio. ENTITY, thank you, buddy. Glad you are here. I appreciate it, sir. Yes sir. Thank you again.

{"id": 333, "text": "Hello everyone. My name is ENTITY, and I am ENTITY of the News Lab at Google, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to a YouTube interview with ENTITY of the United States. thanks for having us here today. Great to see you, ENTITY. Thanks. We are really excited for this interview, today. I should tell our viewers just what a YouTube interview is. Right. Grove: We have invited three top YouTube creators here to the White House today, we are in the East Room, and they have set up their own YouTube sets right here in the White House for a very special YouTube video with a very special guest, ENTITY of the United States. Now, they have been asking their millions of subscribers on YouTube what they should ask you in today's interview. None of those questions has ENTITY seen before. And we have also been taking a look on Google at what Americans were searching for during your State of the Union address. So ENTITY, this is data that we have collected anonymously across all of Google searches in America, top questions that people asked during your State of the Union speech included, what is middle class income? Why are gas prices dropping? People also want to know stuff like, how much does ENTITY make? When does his term end? What does the speaker of the House do? Right. So these are things that are on people's mind as they watch your speech. Next, we sort of backed up and looked at the issues. Yep. So of all the issues you addressed during the speech, which issues were Googled most during your State of the Union? College, number one, far and away, followed by taxes, housing, employment, education. Finally, ENTITY, you might be curious: what was the most asked question on Google during the first 10 minutes or so of your State of the Union? Right. It was how old is ENTITY? You can see this huge spike as you begin your speech, and then, you know, throughout, people very curious about how old you are. Go figure. Well, let us get straight to the interview. We will show you more Google trends throughout the conversation today, but let us get right to the questions. Good. I want to introduce you first to ENTITY of the Vlog brothers. I am only going to get one shot at this. I do not think I am going to get a lot of chances to interview ENTITY, so I am going to jump right in. Let us do it. Start grilling you. I watched the State of the Union. Yeah. A lot of really interesting ideas there. I am not the only person who is said this: a little worried that none of them are at all politically feasible. Am I wrong? Well, first of all, there is some areas where I think we can get some Republican cooperation on infrastructure, for example. Historically, that has not been a partisan issue: roads, bridges; now that we are in the 21st century, broadband lines into communities that do not have good access; making sure we have got a first class power grid so that we are not leaking a lot of energy and we can produce more energy without causing more carbon pollution. So there is some areas where, I think right away we can get some cooperation. There is some areas where it is important for us to frame the debate and get the American people behind us, because even if something does not happen immediately here in Washington, it starts having an impact around the country. A great example of that is the minimum wage. I called for the -- a rise in the minimum wage last year, and Congress still has not passed it yet. But in the meantime, you have got 17 states, you have got cities and others that are raising the minimum wage. And so, it creates movements that ultimately, you know, change things in Washington, as well. So, you used the phrase, middle-class economics ... Yeah. ... in the speech, which I think is a -- is an idea that we needed a phrase for. Right. But when I first told people I was going to be able to come talk to you, a lot of them expressed that they felt like the government was never going to have their interests at heart because the government existed to protect the interests of corporations and business. And the thing that they use is -- like, the prime example of this is taking former leaders of industry and putting them in positions where they are regulating the industries they used to be in charge of. Right. Is that a legitimate concern? And do you understand where those people are coming from? Yeah. You know, look, I understand people's skepticism and cynicism. On the other hand, think about a bunch of stuff that government does do. I mean, since I have been in office, we have been able to take away money that was being siphoned off by banks in the student loan program. And billions of dollars are now suddenly going directly to students to make it easier for them to finance their student loans. You know, simple stuff that we often take for granted, like Social Security or Medicare for -- in the case of many of your viewers -- your -- their grandparents. Mm-hmm. You know, that is a government program that helps a lot of people. And so, you know, what is true is that too often, lobbyists and special interests are able to block efforts to make the system fairer and to make it work better. But our history shows that when people get involved, when they get engaged, when they vote, that, in fact, change happens. It does not always happen 100 percent and it does not always happen immediately, but it happens. So -- we are going to jump around a lot here... Sure. ... because I have a lot of topics. I understand. It is -- I do not have a lot of... It is OK. ... it is just crazy that I have to do this. I am going to keep my questions -- my answers as short as possible. I -- I appreciate you doing that. All right. I will try to zip through it. So, I feel like whenever a new weapons technology is developed, we spend five or 10 years sort of coming to understand the full implications of that new technology. And sometimes, we look back at those initial years of its use as... Yes. ... like we maybe misused or overused that technology. Right. Are you at all worried that your administration is going to be seen as a time when drone strikes were a technology like -- that we see as over or misused? Well, you know, basically, drone technology came into its own right when I first came into office. We have tried to put a series of constraints on how it is used. But understand that our goal has always been, how do we target very specific terrorists who are, you know, proven to be trying to kill us? Or, more frequently, kill innocent Muslims in their home countries? And how do we do that with -- with as little damage to the surrounding communities and innocent people as possible? You know, part of what is really tough for me as commander in chief is the fact that any kind of war is damaging. Any kind of war results in casualties. And, in fact, the sort of damage that may have taken place with a drone strike is always significantly less than if I ordered a raid into a village where a high-value terrorist target was. So, you take the bin Laden operation in Pakistan, for example. Probably as successful and as effective an operation as we could have imagined. Well... You know, there were some people killed in that operation. And the truth of the matter is that anytime we are going after terrorists who are embedded in communities, there are dangers there. But I think it is entirely legitimate to say that as new technologies develop, we have to make sure that we step back and say: Do we have a legal framework? And a set of controls on it? Because I think what people worry about is that it is a little more antiseptic than when we send troops in; that it may seem as if there is no cost to it. And we have tried to do that. And I think there have been some lessons learned, and occasionally there've been mistakes that have been made, and, you know, nobody grieves over that more than I do. But it is -- it is something that we take very seriously. And I would argue that today's technologies can enable us to defend ourselves, causing less damage to those communities than in the past. Sort of along those lines, there is a lot of bad things happening in the world, but I feel like none more so than the kind of generations-long oppression and even genocide that is been happening in North Korea. We recently, you know, implemented new sanctions against North Korea because of a cyber attack against us. Now, it is obviously a problematic cyber attack, but no one was physically hurt. Right. I was surprised to find that there were any sanctions that we could sanction that had not been sanctioned yet. Like -- like, how was there anything left? I feel like, as the strongest nation in the world, like it feels wrong that such injustice could exist in the world. No, look, North Korea is the most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on earth. And the kind of authoritarianism that exists there, you almost cannot duplicate anywhere else. It -- it is brutal and it is oppressive. And as a consequence, the country cannot really even feed its own people. There are not that many sanctions left. I mean, we keep on trying to ratchet it up a little bit higher. Over time, you will see a regime like this collapse. Our capacity to effect change in North Korea is somewhat limited because you have got a million-person army and they have nuclear technologies and missiles. That is all they spend their money on, essentially, is on their war machine. And we have got an ally South Korea right next door, that if there were a war would be severely affected. So, the answer is not going to be a military solution. We will keep on ratcheting the pressure. But part of what is happening is the environment that we are speaking in today, the Internet, over time is going to be penetrating that country and it is very hard to sustain that kind of brutal authoritarian regime in this modern world. Information ends up seeping in over time and change -- bringing about change. And that is something that we are constantly looking for way to accelerate. So I -- sometimes people think I do -- but I do not smoke pot. And I -- it just is not for me. I think that it is bad for my brain. I am not into it, but other people think I do smoke pot because I am -- I am in favor of legalizing marijuana. Right. And we are in a really weird place... Yeah. ... with marijuana right now. Like, it is illegal in some places, but -- it is illegal everywhere, but in some places it is kind of OK. But if the state think it is not OK, then let us throw those people in jail. I feel like it -- it -- you know, it leads to excessive incarceration, especially among minorities. And in places where it is been legalized, everything's doing OK. Yeah. How do we move forward out of this legal gray area weirdness? Well, what you are seeing now is Colorado, Washington, through state referendum. They are experimenting with legal marijuana. The position of my administration has been that we still have federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. But we are not going to spend a lot of resources trying to turn back decisions that have been made at the state level on this issue. My suspicion is that you are going to see other states start looking at this. What I am doing at the federal level is asking my Department of Justice just to examine generally how we are treating nonviolent drug offenders. Because I think you are right. You know, what we have done is instead of focusing on treatment, the same way we focused, say, with tobacco or drunk driving or other problems where we treat it as a public health problem, we have treated this exclusively as a criminal problem. And I think that it is been counterproductive, and it is been, you know, devastating in a lot of minority communities. It presents the possibility at least of unequal application of the law. And that has to be changed. Now, the good news is, is that we are starting to get some interest among Republicans, as well as Democrats, in -- in reforming the criminal justice system. We have been able to initiate some changes administratively. And last year, you had the first time in 40 years where the crime rate and the incarceration rate went down at the same time. I hope we can continue with those trends because there is just a smarter way of dealing with these issues. ENTITY, the next topic that we are going to cover is another angle on cybersecurity. Yeah. We thought you'd be interested to know that searches on Google for cybersecurity have really risen over the past couple of years to the point where now more people are searching for cybersecurity than national security overall. So, clearly a topic on a lot of people's minds. Right. To tackle this topic and a lot of others I want to introduce you to our next YouTube star, ENTITY. Thank you very much. All right. Let us get started. My social media reaches over five million fans. That is a lot of people. Thank you. Especially now. But I feel like I thought I was able to say whatever I wanted to say whenever I wanted to say how I wanted to say it because it was mine. But then the Sony hacking thing happened. Right. Right. And it is like why did not the government help Sony feel protected and safe enough to release the film on time? Because something like that, the fallout affects me. Well, look. Cybersecurity is a huge issue we have been working on since I came to office. And in fairness, the administration before me probably was starting to work on it. Although the changes in the media have happened so fast and so much stuff is going online today that it becomes that much more important. The challenge we have got is that most of the Internet and the infrastructure that allows you to be posting on YouTube and people accessing your stuff, most of that stuff's in private hands. It is not in public hands. And so what we have to do is to work with private companies telling them here is what we are seeing, here is how you can protect yourself, here is how you should share information with other companies who start seeing hackers getting into their stuff so that everybody can pool the information and we can all protect each other together. And it moves very fast because these hackers are -- you do not have to have a lot of equipment in order to be able to do this hacking. In fact, the hacking against Sony, which we believe was done by North Korea, it was not even that sophisticated. But it just goes to show how vulnerable we are. So we continue to do more with private industry, to share with them best practices to how they can protect themselves. It is sort of like with your own ATM machine -- ATM card or your pass code, your passwords, your personal privacy. There is certain things you can do to make yourself more protected. So we are sharing that information with them. But what we are also asking Congress to do is pass a law that would give us more tools to fight against this in the future. And I am confident that this is something we can actually get some good bipartisan support for. So you are going to be all right. People are going to still be able to watch your show, I promise. OK. OK. I have three family members who are in the law enforcement. And my husband who painted there, he is retired from the Air Force. Well, we are grateful for his service. You tell him thank you. I will do that. However, he is mad at me right now because I cut all the hoods off his hoodies. I did. I did that for real... I understand. ... to protect him because I am afraid when he goes outside that somebody might shoot and kill him. And it is not like regular folks. It is the po-po. I hope that this changes. How can we bridge the gap between black, African- American males and white cops? Well, first of all, we always have to just remind ourselves that the overwhelming majority of police officers, they are doing a really tough job and they are doing it well. And they are doing it professionally. What we also know is that there is still biases in our society that in split-second situations where people having to make quick decisions that studies have shown African-American males are seen as more threatening, which puts them in more vulnerable positions. Yes. Young African-American males are typically seen as older than they are. And so a lot of the way to solve this is to improve training so people can be aware of their biases ahead of time. And when I was in the state legislature back in Illinois, for example, I passed a racial profiling bill. It essentially said how are we going to tackle this problem? Let us make sure we are keeping track of the race of everybody that was being stopped. And just by the small fix of keeping track, suddenly each cop when they were about to make a traffic stop they had to think, OK, am I stopping this person because I should be stopping them? Or is some bias at work? And just that kind of mindfulness about it ended up resulting in better data, better policing, more trust by the communities that are affected. And we can do some of that same stuff and use those same tools. I have put together a task force with police and community activists, including some of the young people who were actively involved in the Ferguson protest to make sure that we come up with what are the best training practices, what are the best tools, more body cameras on police officers so that they know they are being watched... Yes. ... and how they are operating. And we are going to take some of those recommendations and we are going to put federal muscle behind them to see if we can make sure the communities all across the country are implementing them. Thank you. There you go. Well, it'll be -- it is something that I think everybody, not just African-Americans or Latinos, but everybody should be concerned about... Yes. ... because you get better policing when communities have confidence that the police are protecting and serving all people and not in any way showing bias. And that is something that we should all have an interest in. Amen to that. There you go. OK. OK. I grew up in Florida... Yes. And I have a lot of friends, close friends, who are Cuban-American. Right. And I have heard the stories of their families escaping... Right. ... and some of them did not even make it to come to the United States for a better life, to get away from the Castros. Right. OK. I mean, the guy puts dic in dictatorship. So I am trying to understand how do you justify dealing with the Castros? Well, here is what is happened. We have had the same policy since I was born, which was we were going to have an embargo. We were going to cut off all contact, all communication. And nothing changed. And you know I have said this before. When you do something over and over again for 50 years and it does not work, it is time to try something new. And we started off initially by allowing more travel to Cuba by Cuban-Americans to visit their family, sending more money back to their family members to help them back in Cuba. We have been doing that for the last four or so years. And it turns out it is been helpful to the people in Cuba. They have more contact with their family. It gives them more hope. Now what we are saying is that by normalizing relations we are going to be able to still put pressure on the Cuban government. But also what happens is now you have got more visitors to Cuba. You start getting telecommunications into Cuba. You start getting the Internet into Cuba. People's minds begin to change. There is more transparency about what is going on. And over time what you are going to see, gradually, is a shift. Because not everybody in Cuba's able to escape to the United States, and the goal ultimately is to make sure that there is freedom in Cuba, not just for the folks who have left. This is dependent on the Supreme Court ruling, but do you think that same-sex marriage will be legalized in all of United States during the time that you are in office? And what can you do to push that along? Well, we have done a lot, obviously, to push it along. I announced my belief that same-sex marriage should be legal that people should be treated the same. We argued against -- as an administration before the Supreme Court we argued against the Defense of Marriage Act that was treating married couples, same-sex couples differently in terms of federal benefits. The Supreme Court now is going to be taking on a case. My hope is that they go ahead and recognize what I think the majority of people in America now recognize, which is two people who love each other... Yes. ... and are treating each other with respect, and are not bothering anybody else, why would the law treat them differently? Why? Why? I mean why? There is no good reason for it. No. So as a consequence I think that I am hopeful the Supreme Court comes to the right decision. But I will tell you, people's hearts have opened up on this issue. I think people know that treating folks unfairly, even if you disagree with their lifestyle choice... Exactly. ... the fact of the matter is they are not bothering you. Let them live their lives. And under the law they should be treated equally. Yes. And as far as me personally, you know just to see all the loving gay and lesbian couples that I know who are great parents... Yes. ... and great partners. You know the idea that we would not treat them like the brothers and sisters that they are, that does not make any sense to me. Yes. Thank you. You are welcome. OK. You are almost done with me, and your time as ENTITY. Yes. With the time left, what would you hope your legacy is? Well, we saved an economy that was on the brink of depression. We have created 11 million new jobs. We have doubled clean energy. We have reduced pollution. We have made sure that more young people can go to college. We have given now so far 10 million people health insurance that did not have it before. And that is going to grow over time. You know we have ended two wars in a responsible way. But we still have challenges. Every day I wake up and I ask myself in particular how can I make sure that folks who are working hard can, not just survive, but how can they thrive? How can they get ahead? And so in the State of the Union that I just gave we talked about how can we provide more help for young families with childcare, huge burden on a lot of people? How can we make sure that college is more affordable? And what I want to do is make sure that the first two years of community colleges are free so that young people can you know have confidence that if they go and try to get more skills that they are not going to be paying through the nose in terms of a lifetime of debt. You know I want to make sure that we are doing more to raise the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave. So there is a lot of basic stuff that we can do that would ensure the economy goes strong, but more importantly that everybody benefits from a strong economy. And that is going to be my focus over the next two years. And once I am done then I will look back and I will see what the legacy is. But hopefully it'll be one in which I am making sure that everybody in this country can succeed. All right, ENTITY. So the next issue we are going to tackle is education. Yes. Something you talked a lot about in your State of the Union. You'd be interested to know that traditionally when people were searching on Google for stuff around college the number one question they asked was what should I bring with me to college. Right. So in the past couple years the number one question has become how to pay for college. Yes. So clearly a topic that a lot of people want to know more about. And to tackle that question and many others we have a very popular YouTube creator next, ENTITY. All right. All right. So I am very excited to hear your answers so I am just going to dive into the questions. Let us go. So my first question for you is regarding education. Yes. I am 19 years old. A lot of my friends are the same age as me, as well as my online audience. And a lot of them are now going to college or are already in college. So my question for you is how can -- what do you think is the best long-term plan for making education as a whole more affordable for students? Well, a couple of things. First of all, college remains the best investment you can make. If you want to do anything right now in this 21st century economy, you are going to be measured by how much knowledge you have and how adaptable you are to changing circumstances. And college, it is not just that it gives you a particular skill, but it also teaches you how to learn you know for your whole life. Right. And you know so it is the key to the future. One of the things that we have done is to make sure that more young people have access to Pell Grants, more people have access to student loans that are lower interest rate. Now I have proposed to make community colleges free for the first two years. And that is a good option for a lot of young people. There're four-year colleges, but a lot of times you can go to a community college for your first two years and then transfer your credits and go to a four-year college. But you have already gotten your first two years free. And we know that it is already working in places like Tennessee. We want to take that all across the country. And then what we have done is we have also said once you get out, if you have got some debt then we want to be able to cap how much you pay back to 10 percent of your income. So that if you decide to become a teacher or a social worker or some helping profession that does not pay a lot, you do not feel like well I cannot do that job because my debt burden's going to be too high. But the single most important thing for your viewers is number one, you will be able to figure out a way to pay for college. But you got to be a smart shopper. You got to know ahead of time how much does a school cost. If they tell you well, we will help you finance it, do not worry, you have got to understand you are going to be taking on some debt. And what is it going to look like once you are finished. Right. You should have some sense of whether you can get in- state tuition versus going to a school out of state because there may be a big difference in terms of cost. And one of the things we are also doing is seeing if we can get more high schools to work with their local colleges so that while you are in high school you can start getting some college credits. That may make it quicker for you to get your college degree. And you know the quicker you get your degree the cheaper it is going to be. That is awesome. Yes. Thank you. My next question I actually relate to on a very personal level because when I was younger I was cyber bullied, which affected me in a very big way. So I went online and I basically spoke about my story, which then a lot of my viewers online came to me leaving comments and asking for tips and advice on you know how I dealt with it. And obviously you know I can give them tips based off of my experience. But sometimes I feel like I reach a point where I just cannot help them as much as I would truly love to. So my question for you is how can we prevent that, prevent bullying in schools and online? Because it is something that happens on a daily basis. Well, I have got to say this is one area where I think your voice is more powerful than ENTITY of the United States you know because peers are going to have more influence than anybody. And when they see young people like you who are willing to speak out and say that is not right and protect other people from this kind of bullying, cyber bulling or any kind of bullying. That is what changes people's minds. That is what has an impact on them. Suddenly it is like oh I guess it is not so cool for me to do that because... Right. ... somebody I respect or somebody who is like me is telling me you know to act differently. So we had a big conference here at the White House in order to prevent bullying. And you know we had a whole bunch of organizations who came together and they were in workshops and looking at various ways of dealing with the issue. But the really most powerful testimonies came from students and young people like you who had organized themselves... Right. ... and were going from campus to campus, school to school, going online and just explaining why you know that is -- you know that kind of bullying tactic is something we can guard against if everybody kind of speaks out against it and uses positive peer pressure to say that is just not acceptable. So you are already doing it. Thank you. I think you have better advice than just about anybody about it because you experienced it. You felt it. Thank you so much. You bet. So last April Boko Haram kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls. And just last month this actually happened again. And a lot of them are still missing. Yes. So what do you think we can do to raise awareness about this issue, and also just prevent it from happening again? Well, as people may know or may not know, Boko Haram is a radical, violent, terrible extremist organization in Nigeria. And they kidnapped 200 young women. And are -- they are in many cases still being held. What we tried to do is to help the Nigerian government to deal with the problem. The Nigerian government has not been as effective as it needs to be in not only finding the girls, but also in stopping this extremist organization from operating inside their territory. And what we are trying to do is mobilize other countries to try to give the Nigerian government more resources, not just military equipment but better intelligence, allowing them to track where these folks are, and to try to stop them. And you know it is hard. But I tell you, the more young people are engaged in issues like this and speak out and let their elected officials know that they care about it, the more attention that is paid to it. And ultimately that is how you solve these problems. And look, there are a lot of really heartbreaking situations all around the world. There are a lot of countries that are still struggling. You know during your lifetime more people have come out of poverty and more people have been able to feel more secure around the world than probably any time in human history. But there is still a lot of bad stuff going on out there. And that is why it is so important for young people like you to educate yourselves about the issues and to speak out and get involved. And over time -- we are not going to solve every problem overnight. But we can have some positive impact. Yes. I completely agree. My next question for you -- so, I was actually just in China. I travel a lot. And I connected to the Internet. And I could not help but notice I could not access the apps and the websites that I do back home. And I just felt kind of isolated from like the online global community. Right. So how can we make them a part of that? Well, you know China and Russia and some other countries around the world that do not have a democratic government and do not have the same traditions of free speech and open Internet, they have recognized. I think that the Internet's so powerful that if people start being able to communicate then they maybe start criticizing the government. And then they may be able to mobilize opposition. And things that are unfair or people who are being mistreated suddenly have a voice. So they are trying to keep a lid on things. And we consistently, wherever we go, insist that issues like free speech and a free and open Internet, we think that that is part of who we are as a people. We think that that has value not just in America but everywhere. We obviously cannot make laws in China. But what we can do is let them know and shine a spotlight on some of those practices and indicate to them that any government that is afraid of its own people and people just peacefully trying t speak out and voice their own opinions is over the long term not going to be as effective and as long-lasting as a government that trusts its people to be able to communicate freely. Got it. Thank you so much. So I am going to be honest with you. Yes. Before I came here to do this interview for YouTube I never really followed politics that much. You are not the only one. A lot of my online audience and just the younger generation do not seem as interested in it. And I personally think that we should be. So my question for you is why should the younger generation be interested in politics? And why should it matter to them? Well, basically politics is just how do we organize ourselves as a society? You know how do we make decisions about how we are going to live together? So, young people care about how college is paid for? Well, the truth of the matter is that the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said you know what? We should start colleges. And dating back to Abraham Lincoln, who started something called the land grant colleges. And he understood that government should invest in people being able to get an education and having the tools to succeed. Well, you guys are the ones who are going to be using these colleges and universities. And if they are not getting enough funding from government and your tuition goes up then you have got more debt. You are the ones affected. So you better have a voice and know what is going on and who is making decisions about that. You are right. You know if you care about an issue like you know making sure the gays and lesbians and transgender persons are treated fairly. Well, laws on the books can make sure that they are not discriminated against. But those laws only pass if politics allows those laws to pass. You know the environment. I am a lot older than you. You are going to be around a lot longer than I am. And if the climate keeps on getting warmer and we have more droughts and more floods and you know the oceans start dying off. You know it is going to be you and your children who are dealing with that. We can stop it. But we can only stop it if we get together and we start using energy differently. And so there is no decision in our lives basically that is not touched in some way by the laws that we have. And we are really lucky that we live in a democracy where our voice matters. But if we do not participate -- it is sort of -- look. I will bet there're a bunch of your friends -- here is -- it is as simple as this. You decide you guys want to go see a movie, and you got a group of friends. And you know somehow you got to figure out which movie you are going to go see because not everybody's going to agree all the time. You are going to have to have a debate. And you are going to have to make an argument. And then eventually -- so you are going to have to compromise... Right. You know otherwise you guys are not going to be hanging out together too much. Well, the same is true for our country. You know we have got to make decisions about which direction we are going to go in, what we are going to be doing, how we are going to spend our money, how we are going to treat each other. And you do not want to be the person that just says OK, whatever. Whatever you guys want to do, I will just do that. You want to express your voice and your values and what you care about. And that is what politics is. It is not really that complicated. It is just -- it is something that people do all the time with their friends and with their family. They negotiate. They compromise. They try to figure out how do we live together? And this is just done at a national level. And some of the issues get pretty complicated. But usually the values are the same ones that you talk about all the time. How do we treat each other with kindness? How do we look after one another? How are we fair to each other? You know and I think that young people usually have good instincts. But sometimes they just get turned off by all the noise and yelling on TV. And that is not how politics has to be. Thank you so much. All right. So my audience had a lot of fun questions for you so we are going to do a quick lightening round. OK. Lightening round, I am really quick. OK. So I know you have a lot to do, obviously... Yes, I do. ... but if you have any free time, what TV show or movies do you watch? You know I am really big on sports. So the truth of the matter is that I am mostly watching SportsCenter. All right. Whenever I am working out in the gym, if there is a basketball game or a football game on I am usually tuned in there. Nice. Yes. OK. What did you want to be growing up? I wanted to be a bunch of different things. I wanted to be an architect for a long time. Wow. Nice. And I suppose in the back of my mind at some point I thought playing in the NBA would be great, being a basketball player. That ended around the age of 13 when I realized I was not talented enough. Aw. It is OK. Things worked out pretty good. I would say so. Yes. I would definitely say so. Exactly. And the last one is if you had any superpower what would it be? Any superpower? You know I guess like the flying thing seems pretty cool right, sort of zipping around and... I would love it. You know. As long as you could stay warm. The invisibility thing seems like a little sneaky to me you know. It is like what are you going to be doing with that? You are going to be listening in on people's conversations. You know I -- so the -- I guess the flying thing. One time somebody asked me this and I gave an answer that my wife Michelle teased me. She thought this was really nerdy. But it is OK. I will go ahead and tell you anyway. And I do not know if this is a superpower, I'd love to be able to speak any language. I would love... That is actually... ... anybody... ... amazing. ... I met anywhere in the world I could just talk in their language. To me that would be really cool. I love that. Is not that a cool one? I would love that too. Yes. But I do not think it'd make a really good movie. You know it is not that exciting. It is a really good one though. See. I have never heard that one before. All right. There you go. Actually one more question for you. Yes? Can you take a selfie with me? Let us do it. , ENTITY. Thank you so much for your interview. We had a lot of fun with it today. No, no. Thank you so much. And I am so proud of what you guys are doing because... : Thank you. ... this is the power of you know what the Internet's all about. You know you can create content and there is not all these barriers to entry. And suddenly you know you get millions of people who are listening to you and in a conversation with you. And it is a great treat for me because more and more there're audiences that get turned off by the traditional news shows or the traditional debates. And so for me to be able to reach your audiences and just hopefully give them a sense of -- that what we do here in Washington, what government does actually matters, makes a difference in their lives. I hope it is been useful. All right. Yes. Thank you so much. So good luck. Thank you. We are very proud of you. All right. Thank you. Just to our viewers, if you missed the first part of the interview or you want to watch it again, just go to YouTube.com/WhiteHouse. Thanks, everybody. Goodbye. OK. Thanks, ENTITY. Thanks, ENTITY. That was a lot of fun. No, you are welcome. Thanks a lot. Yes.

{"id": 114, "text": "Let us start with how the campaign has been going. Ever since the first debate, Romney has abruptly shifted his position on a whole host of issues, from his tax plan to financial regulation. He made a strong sales pitch for what I think are really wrongheaded plans. But the facts have not changed. The fundamentals have not changed. The essence of this race is, Do we have an economy that is building on all the work we have done over the last four years - an economy where we are focused on growing a strong, vibrant middle class, where we are focused on creating a strong manufacturing base here in the United States, where we are continuing to cut our imports of foreign oil, not only by developing homegrown oil and gas, but also by making sure that we are developing and taking leadership in clean energy? Are we going to continue to make investments in education that ensure that every kid in America has a shot at success if they are willing to work hard? Are we going to reduce our deficit in a way that is balanced and allows us to continue to make the investments that help us to grow? That is what I am putting forward. What Governor Romney's putting forward is a return to the very same policies that got us into this mess in the first place: tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and rollbacks of regulations that we fought very hard against lobbyists and special interests to put in place, to make sure that we do not have taxpayerfunded bailouts, to make sure that insurance companies are not taking advantage of folks who need health care, to make sure that we have a strong consumer advocate in place to protect people from unscrupulous lenders. So what I am absolutely sure about is that we have got the better argument. And Governor Romney understands that. It is the reason why, after a year and a half of campaigning on plans that very clearly were going to involve $5 trillion worth of tax cuts, he is trying to fog up the issues, because he knows that the American people are not buying what he is selling. Many observers have commented on how Romney has misrepresented or even changed his positions in this last leg of the campaign - that he is been like a chameleon on plaid. Do you feel that he has lied to the American people? What I think happened is that we won the battle of ideas during the course of the last year. His argument for a $5 trillion tax cut skewed toward the wealthy - which would necessarily involve either blowing up the deficit or increasing taxes on middle-class families - is not a recipe for growth. It will not create jobs, it will not reduce the deficit, and the American people understand that. So two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, they had to figure out, Is there some way that we can fuzz up what we have been proposing? In the first debate, he made as good a presentation as he could on what is a fundamentally flawed economic theory. What we are going to be focused on is making certain that he has to answer for those theories - ones that will not be good for the middle class and will not grow the economy long term. But understand, there is no doubt that what he has campaigned on for the last year is what he believes, because we have seen it before. We saw it when he was the governor of Massachusetts: His efforts to balance the budget involved raising taxes and fees on middle-class families, even as wealthy families were getting tax breaks, gutting investments in education and forcing costs down to local school districts and local communities. We saw it in how he answered a question on 60 Minutes as recently as two weeks ago, when he said he thought it was fair for someone like him, who is making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or bus driver making $50,000 a year. His basic theory is that if folks at the top are doing well and are unencumbered, that prosperity will rain down on everybody else, because they will make better decisions about allocating capital. I have got a different theory. I believe that when middle-class families are doing well - they have got money in their pockets, they are getting decent wages, they have got some health care security - then we all do better. Because those are customers who are buying goods and services, so businesses do better. It goes back to what Henry Ford understood when he decided to pay higher wages to his workers: that meant those workers on the assembly line making those Model T's could end up buying those cars. That is how we grew a middle class. So more than anything, our task over the next four weeks is just to lay bare just what these economic choices are. The American people are going to understand which choice is better for them and what is going to be better for the country as a whole. Where were you when you first saw Romney's speech in Boca Raton about the 47 percent? What was your first reaction? We were out campaigning. I do not remember which state we were in - probably Ohio. Since we have been there so often, the odds are, it was probably Ohio. It took a while before we actually saw the full transcript of what he said. I think it was pretty surprising. It is an indication of a story that Republicans have been telling themselves for a while, at least a sizable portion - that somehow, half the country consider themselves victims and want to be dependent on government. Obviously, he was wrong on the facts, since the overwhelming majority of that 47 percent are either folks that are working every day and paying all kinds of taxes but just do not earn enough money to pay income tax; or are senior citizens who worked all their lives and did everything right so they could count on some sense of security as they got older; or they are veterans who have sacrificed for our country, or soldiers who are sacrificing as we speak on behalf of our country. But that sense that folks who have contributed to this country but are at the lower ends of the income scale are somehow looking for government to do something for them, or feel some sense of entitlement, is just fundamentally wrong. It does not jive with what I see as I travel across the country every day. Are there people who, both at the top and the bottom, are not pulling their weight and are looking for a special deal? Sure. But as was pointed out when this controversy erupted, there are a whole bunch of millionaires who are not paying any income tax, as well as people at the lower end of the income spectrum who may be taking advantage of the safety net that we have put in place. We should hold everybody accountable who is not doing their fair share. That is what the American people believe: They do not like bailouts, they do not like handouts, but they do understand that we have to have a government that ensures that if somebody is working hard and carrying out their responsibilities, that they can succeed and that they can give the prospects of a better life to their kids and their grandkids. What has surprised you the most about the Republican campaign this year? What was interesting was the degree to which Governor Romney was willing to embrace the most extreme positions in the Republican Party: on immigration, on environmental issues, on women's issues and on the economy. Frankly, I think that is telling when you start thinking about the presidency. If you cannot say no to certain elements of your party, if you do not have sets of principles that you are willing to fight for, even if they are not politically convenient, then you are gonna have a tough time in this office. It was only at a point where it was determined that the American people had soundly rejected those views that you started seeing him try to fuzz up those positions. But they remain his positions. He continues to believe, when it comes to immigration, that the Arizona law is a model for the nation, and that self-deportation is the answer. When it comes to women's health issues, he continues to believe that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. He would be supportive of a constitutional amendment overturning a woman's right to choose, would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, is supportive of legislation that would allow employers to make determinations as to whether women could get contraception through their insurance companies. Four weeks out from an election, you cannot hide from positions that ultimately are out of sync with how the majority of Americans think. I guarantee if you talk to not just Democratic women, but a whole bunch of Republican and Independent women, they will tell you they are very capable of making their own health care decisions. If you have a chance to meet these Dream Act kids, some of whom were brought here when they were two or three or five, and are American in every sense, except for their papers - love this country, have pledged allegiance to this flag, want to contribute - then you would reject the idea that somehow they should be deported to some country where they have never been. But those are Governor Romney's positions, and we gotta make sure that the American people understand those positions. Do you have any fear that Roe v. Wade could be overturned if the Republicans win the presidency and appoint another Supreme Court justice? I do not think there is any doubt. Governor Romney has made clear that is his position. His running mate has made this one of the central principles of his public life. Typically, ENTITY is going to have one or two Supreme Court nominees during the course of his presidency, and we know that the current Supreme Court has at least four members who would overturn Roe v. Wade. All it takes is one more for that to happen. How do you feel about Justice Roberts' ruling on the Affordable Care Act? Were you surprised? I was not surprised. I was always confident that the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, was constitutional. It was interesting to see them, or Justice Roberts in particular, take the approach that this was constitutional under the taxing power. The truth is that if you look at the precedents dating back to the 1930s, this was clearly constitutional under the Commerce Clause. I think Justice Roberts made a decision that allowed him to preserve the law but allowed him to keep in reserve the desire, maybe, to scale back Congress' power under the Commerce Clause in future cases. What made you so certain that the law was constitutional? It is hard to dispute that health care is a national issue of massive importance. It takes up 17 or 18 percent of our entire economy; it touches on everybody's lives; it is a massive burden on businesses, on our federal budget and on families. It is practiced across state lines. So the notion that Congress could not take a comprehensive approach to that problem the way we have makes no sense. I am very proud of the steps we have taken already: making sure that insurance companies cannot impose lifetime limits that could leave families high and dry if somebody gets a severe illness. Parents being able to keep their kids on their own plans until they are 26 years old. The rebates that are already going out to customers because we have said to insurance companies that you have got to spend the dollars you collect in premiums on actually providing care, not just on overhead and CEO salaries. The $600 a year that seniors are saving on their prescription drugs. The tax breaks we are providing small businesses in order to provide health insurance for their families. The cost-control measures that are trying to develop better ways of providing care. All those things are already happening. By 2014, people who have pre-existing conditions or individuals who are paying 18 or 20 percent more for health insurance than somebody on a big group plan - they are going to have a chance to get affordable care, and we will provide tax credits to the folks who need it. So this is a model that we know can work. It is working in Massachusetts right now - you have 98 percent of adults and 99.5 percent of kids in Massachusetts with health insurance. For the greatest nation on Earth not to make sure that people are not going bankrupt when they get sick - that was a blot on our society. And for us to take this step forward is something that is really going to make a big difference for millions of families for decades to come. It also gives us our best opportunity to start really going after the waste and inefficiencies of the system, so that we can start cutting back on the health care inflation that is driving our deficit and hurting families and businesses every single day. You said, a.k.a. Obamacare. Do you mind if historians call the achievement Obamacare? I will be very proud. Because I am confident that I am going to win this election, and that we are going to implement it over the next four years. Just like Medicare and Social Security, as time goes on, as people see what it does, as it gets refined and improved, people will say, This was the last piece to our basic social compact - providing people with some core security from the financial burdens of an illness or bad luck. You sometimes use the term fair shake. FDR had the New Deal, Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society. Is the Fair Shake something you'd be comfortable with to describe your legacy? I'd be comfortable with that, and hearing it from a historian, it sounds pretty good to me. But look, the key thing I have tried to communicate, and I will continue to try to communicate to the American people, is that when you talk about economic fairness, it is not just an issue of fairness - it is also an issue of growth. It is how the economy succeeds. Republicans, and certainly Mitt Romney, often tries to frame this as Obama's a redistributionist, whereas we want to grow the pie instead of taking from Peter to pay Paul. But look at our history: When we have been successful, it is because everybody is in on the action. Everybody feels a sense of ownership, because everybody is benefitting from rising productivity, everybody is benefitting from a growing economy. When prosperity is broad-based, it is stable, it is steady, it is robust. But when you have just a few people at the very top benefitting from what we do together as an economy, then growth gets constrained. On one end, you have got a lot of money in the hands of a very few people who are speculating and engaging in a lot of financial transactions that can get our economy in trouble. We saw that in 2007 and 2008. On the other end, you have got middle-income people and low-income people who are overextended, taking on too much debt, and that can create problems. You do not have enough customers to buy the products and services that are being produced, so businesses then pull back and you get into a negative cycle. When the opposite is the case, you get into a virtuous cycle, and that is what we are constantly trying to push. The success we have had, although we have got a long way to go, is based on making sure that everybody feels they have got a stake in the system. Look at what happened in the auto industry: You have got management and workers coming together, everybody making some sacrifices. Suddenly, what was an industry on the brink of collapse is now resurgent. GM's on top again, Chrysler is making profits like it has not made before, all the supplier chains that employ people all across the Midwest are benefitting. And that model, I think, is one that the American people instinctively get. The auto bailout helped rescue states like Ohio from economic disaster. What, in turn, have you learned from the people of Ohio during your many visits to the state? They just want to work hard, but they want to make sure that hard work is rewarded. When you go into these auto plants, you get folks who not only have been working at the plant for 15 years, their dad worked at the plant, sometimes their grandfather worked at the plant. It is not just a paycheck for them - they really take great pride in making great products, making a great car. One plant we went to, a bunch of workers had just won the lottery, and they were still showing up to work every single day. One of them had bought his wife one of the cars he had made, for her birthday, and he had bought flags for his entire town, because he was proud of his country and there was no place he'd rather be. That is what you see in Ohio, that is what you see across the country. People want to work hard, they want to feel like they are contributing, they want to feel like they are helping to build the country. All they want is just a chance. Have you ever read Ayn Rand? Sure. What do you think Paul Ryan's obsession with her work would mean if he were vice president? Well, you'd have to ask Paul Ryan what that means to him. Ayn Rand is one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we'd pick up. Then, as we get older, we realize that a world in which we are only thinking about ourselves and not thinking about anybody else, in which we are considering the entire project of developing ourselves as more important than our relationships to other people and making sure that everybody else has opportunity - that that is a pretty narrow vision. It is not one that, I think, describes what is best in America. Unfortunately, it does seem as if sometimes that vision of a you are on your own society has consumed a big chunk of the Republican Party. Of course, that is not the Republican tradition. I made this point in the first debate. You look at Abraham Lincoln: He very much believed in self-sufficiency and self-reliance. He embodied it - that you work hard and you make it, that your efforts should take you as far as your dreams can take you. But he also understood that there is some things we do better together. That we make investments in our infrastructure and railroads and canals and land-grant colleges and the National Academy of Sciences, because that provides us all with an opportunity to fulfill our potential, and we will all be better off as a consequence. He also had a sense of deep, profound empathy, a sense of the intrinsic worth of every individual, which led him to his opposition to slavery and ultimately to signing the Emancipation Proclamation. That view of life - as one in which we are all connected, as opposed to all isolated and looking out only for ourselves - that is a view that has made America great and allowed us to stitch together a sense of national identity out of all these different immigrant groups who have come here in waves throughout our history. If Americans re-elect you, what will be different in your second term? What is your plan to avoid four more years of gridlock? It is important for people to understand how much we have gotten done, because sometimes folks obsess with gridlock and the ugliness of the process here in Washington. We passed health care - something that presidents have tried to do for 100 years, and we will implement it. We passed the toughest Wall Street reform since the 1930s, and we will implement it and continue to strengthen it. We have put in place a Consumer Finance Protection Agency that is going to be an ongoing advocate for every American out there who is involved in a financial transaction, saving people billions of dollars. We have expanded access to college through the Pell Grant program and by keeping student loans low. The list of things that we have accomplished, even once the Republicans took over, is significant. Now, there are some things that are undone. We are going to have to get a handle on our deficit and debt, but we need to do it in a balanced way that does not simply stick it to middle-class families. I am confident we can get that accomplished, in part, because the Bush tax cuts lapse at the end of this year, and we will have a showdown about how we are going to fund the government that we need to grow in a sensible way, in a balanced way. Immigration reform I believe we will get done, because the Republican Party will start recognizing that alienating the fastestgrowing segments of our society is probably not good politics for them - not to mention the fact that immigration reform is the right thing to do. On energy and climate change, we will continue to develop oil and natural-gas resources, but we will build off the work we have done, doubling fuel-efficiency standards on cars and doubling the investment we have made in clean energy. There is a huge opportunity for us to focus on energy efficiency in our buildings, in our schools and in our residences. If we can make our economy as energy efficient as Japan, say, we would be cutting our greenhouse emissions by 20 percent and saving consumers billions of dollars every single year. And by the way, we can put a whole bunch of construction workers back to work in the process. Internationally, having ended the war in Iraq, I am now committed to ending the war in Afghanistan by 2014. Doing that in a responsible way will have a huge impact, because we are also going to be able to take the money we have saved on war to do some nation-building here at home. We are going to have a full agenda in the second four years, but people should not underestimate how much we can get done. Obviously, I'd love to see a shift in Congress where we are electing people who are less interested in the next election and obstruction and are more interested in getting stuff done. And that is true whether it is Republicans or Democrats. I just want to make sure that there are people who have some sense of service toward their constituencies. Forget for a moment about obstruction by Wall Street lobbyists and Republicans in Congress. If you could single-handedly enact one piece of regulation on the financial industry, what would it be? The story of Dodd-Frank is not yet complete, because the rules are still being developed. Dodd-Frank provided a platform to make sure that we end some of the most egregious practices and prevent another taxpayer-funded bailout. We have significantly increased capital requirements and essentially created a wind-down mechanism for institutions that make bad bets, so the whole system is not held hostage to them going under. We have to make sure that the rules issued around the Volcker Rule are actually enforced. So there is a lot of good work that will be done around Dodd-Frank. I have looked at some of Rolling Stone's articles that say, This did not go far enough, we did not institute Glass-Steagall and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. But there is not evidence that having Glass-Steagall in place would somehow change the dynamic. Lehman Brothers was not a commercial bank, it was an investment bank. AIG was not an FDIC-insured bank, it was an insurance institution. So the problem in today's financial sector cannot be solved simply by reimposing models that were created in the 1930s. I will tell you, the single biggest thing that I would like to see is changing incentives on Wall Street and how people get compensated. That ultimately requires not just congressional legislation but a change in corporate governance. You still have a situation where people making bets can get a huge upside, and their downsides are limited. So it tilts the whole system in favor of very risky behavior. I think a legitimate concern, even after Dodd-Frank, is, Have we completely changed those incentives? When investment banks, for example, were partnerships, as opposed to corporations, all those partners understood that if there was some tail risk out there - some unanticipated event that might result in the whole firm blowing up - that they were going to lose all their money, they were going to lose all their assets. They were not protected. These days, you have got guys who are making five years of risky bets, but it is making them $100 million every year. By the time the chicken comes home to roost, they are still way ahead of the game. So I think it is something that needs to be discussed. But that is not something that can entirely be legislated - that is something that also has to involve shareholders and boards of directors being better stewards of their institutions. Bill Clinton - how important is he as a surrogate for you? What is your friendship with him like these days? Our relationship is terrific. He did a masterful job, obviously, at the convention. He has been a tireless surrogate on our behalf. I am talking to him regularly, and he is given me good advice. Not only is he a great politician, but he is also somebody who has a lot of credibility with the public when it comes to how the economy works. Because the last time we had healthy, broad-based growth was when he was president, and people remember that. So he can say things that people immediately grab on to. And one of the things he said during the convention that I thought was very helpful was to put this whole economic crisis in context. The biggest challenge we have always had is that unlike FDR - who came into office when the economy had already bottomed out, so people understood that everything done subsequent to his election was making things better - I came in just as we were sliding. Because of the actions we took, we averted a Great Depression - but in the process, we also muddied up the political narrative, because it allowed somebody like Romney to somehow blame my policies for the mess that the previous administration created. Bill Clinton can point that out in ways that are really helpful and really powerful. Halloween's coming up. If you could have Mitt Romney dress in a costume, what should he be for Halloween? I do not know about this Halloween. Next Halloween I hope he will be an ex-presidential candidate.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdouglasbrinkleyrollingstone", "title": "Interview with Douglas Brinkley of Rolling Stone", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-douglas-brinkley-rolling-stone", "publication_date": "11-10-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 362, "text": "Obviously, this is a huge success, getting national service passed so quickly. One of the goals of national service is to have kids have a multicultural experience. But yet, in the pilot program, Summer of Service, within a couple of days, the black kids were in black caucuses, there were Hispanic caucuses and gang groups. How are you going to make sure during national service, when it gets going, that they serve side by side? Well, those are the kinds of projects we will favor. But I think if you look all across the world today, there is always going to be some ethnic cohesion. People are going to pull together, talk together, feel a greater initial comfort level. That is just true worldwide. But what we also saw in the Summer of Service is that people really were working together across racial and ethnic groups to an extent greater than they had before. I think what we have to do is let people be themselves but favor those programs that have multiracial makeup, and we will do that. Okay. As far as health care is concerned, is not it true that because your health care plan is community based that many young people, because they are young and healthy and they get discounts on insurance now, may end up paying more with your plan? Yes, in the first year, those who have insurance may pay more, depending on whether they work for small or big businesses. Very young people who are basically in plans that have big businesses insuring them may pay some more in the first year. Even they, however, within 5 years should be paying less, because we slow the rate of growth in these premiums. Young people who work for small businesses probably will not pay more because they are paying too much already, all small businesses. And they will be in great big groups. But I would also point out that an awful lot of young people who do not have health insurance-and some young people do have access; some young people do get sick; some young people even have serious illnesses-so it will help them. And I would say, also, to all these young people, if we change it in this way so that we are all rated as a community, what it means is, is that some family gets a sick child, it means that they will not lose their health insurance if they change jobs, or they will not be locked into the job they are in. And all of the young people-I can certify because I was one once-will someday be middle-aged, will someday be older, and they will then benefit from that. So the fair thing for America to do is to do what Hawaii has already done, what a couple of other States have already done, and what other nations do, which is to have the nation in big pools of people so that we can keep overall costs down. In terms of the health care plan, last time I spoke with you, you said you wanted abortion to be covered under the health care plan. And now I understand the language says medically necessary, pregnancy-related services are covered. That is what it says-- Does that mean that anyone who wants an abortion can get one and have it covered under the plan? It means that it will be just like it is today in most private plans. Most private plans absolutely cover it. But no insurance plan specifically mentioned any surgical procedure. The surest way to eliminate any kind of abortion coverage from this act would be to mention it specifically, because no other surgical procedure, none, are mentioned specifically. And all private insurance plans which cover abortion may cover pregnancy-related services, and the doctor and the woman make the decision. So what we propose to do is to put lowincome people who are covered by the Government today into these big pools with people who are privately insured, give everybody a private plan. I am sorry, I do not -is it more than the Hyde amendment in terms of-- Oh, yes, absolutely. How so? I do not -- Because the Hyde amendment prohibits any public funding for abortions, except when the life of the mother is at risk. But I thought the Hyde amendment was self-certifying now, and you could say, I have a heart condition, therefore-- Well, I do not know about that, but you have to prove that your life is at risk. Or rape and incest. Not in the Hyde amendment. No? Okay. No. We tried to expand it and broaden it, but this would simply put people who get Government funds into big private insurance pools, and they would then be treated like other people in private insurance pools. It is just what we did for the public employees this year; we got rid of the Hyde amendment for public employees this year. You could not have just put abortion instead of pregnancy-related ? Absolutely not. And it would have been wrong to do that. Then people would say, Well, why do not you put brain surgery in there; why do not you put appendectomies in there; why do not you put other surgeries in there? And that would have sparked a whole reaction. They would say, Why are we giving special preference to one kind of procedure over all others? This will guarantee that most plans will cover abortions. Now, there will be religious exemptions, which there are today. Catholic churches or other religious groups that have health plans do not have to cover it; doctors who have religious-do not have to do it. But if a doctor and a woman decide that that is an appropriate pregnancy-related service under this plan, then it can be provided. In terms of paying for universal health care, why are you trying to sugar-coat it? Why not just give us the bitter medicine of how much it is going to cost us in taxes? I am not trying to sugar-coat it. I have worked harder to get better cost estimates on this than anybody ever has. Moynihan-in all respect to Senator Moynihan, he is a very brilliant man, but he and his committee staff have not done anything like the work that I have done on this. Now, they may not want to pass Medicare cuts; they should say that. It does not mean the numbers are not right. We have had-- --some people say-- No. We have had four different Government Agencies, for the first time, working together to verify these numbers. We have had outside actuaries from people who work for private business working to verify these numbers. It may be difficult to pass because the Congress will not want to make the administrative changes necessary to lower the rate of increase. But I want to tell-first of all, there are no Medicaid cuts in this. The inflation rate in this country today is about 3 percent. Medicaid's going up this year at 16 percent. We are talking about, over an 8-year period, bringing down the rate of inflation in health care costs to the rate of inflation in the economy plus the number of people who are increased into the program. That is all we are talking about doing. For the next 5 years, health care costs will still go up more than prices as a whole in this economy. I do not think that is fantasyland, if you have a systematic change. Other countries do it. The Mayo Clinic, which is normally thought of as having some of the finest care in the world, is now charging less for many basic services than an awful lot of ordinary health care plans all across America today because they manage their business better. So it is not fantasy to say that the numbers are right and they can be achieved. Will it be politically difficult to do? You bet. Why? Because there are a lot of people who make a lot of money out of the inefficiencies of the system today. And because there are a lot of people who honestly do not believe you can ever do more with less. But I do, and I think there is a lot of evidence of that. So, Senator Moynihan is right, it is going to be tough to pass. I do not think that the numbers are wrong. And let me also say something nobody else has noticed. There are 85 Members of the House of Representatives who want the Government to basically eliminate the private health insurance companies, get out of it altogether, have a huge tax increase to pay for health care but eliminate the premiums. They propose bigger cuts in Medicare and Medicaid than I do. So I just think that the numbers are entirely defensible, and I think we will be able to persuade the Congress. I forgot to ask you about-why Soul Asylum? They were supportive in the campaign, and they made that wonderful song about runaway children, which had a big impact on young people throughout the country. We just thought they'd be a good group to be here. Does Chelsea like them? Yes. I do, too. I heard them play last night, you know. So I sort of got caught up on my music last night, listening to them practice. Have people that looked like that ever walked into your Oval Office before? Oh, sure. This is everybody's Oval Office. I am just a tenant here. I see. Thanks. Most people here tend to bathe, however. Thanks. Thanks.

{"id": 329, "text": "Do you want to venture a guess on who is going to come out on top tomorrow-Democratic field? No. I will let them have that all to themselves and decide. Want to tell us who you would prefer to face in November? No, no-I will offer no help in who they might want to select. Would you tell us if you have been at all surprised by Gary Hart's surge in the primaries so far? Well, maybe might not have picked that, and yet I think I can understand-a kind of a new face. But I still think that it is too early to really be naming any front-runners or anything in that race. Having gone through a series of primaries, there is a long way to go. ENTITY, a lot of us pundits have been predicting that this race would turn into a generational conflict. I recall you in the past talking about how-finally how America needs to return to the stature and to the values of its past. Will you be adjusting that strategy if you are facing an opponent who talks about, compares himself-backing the future, as opposed to the policies of the past? No, I have always felt and based any campaigning or anything that I do on what we do, not what the other fellow says he is going to do-what we do and what we plan to do. And that is the way I would campaign. I do not see any need for any generational struggle in here, but if there is, maybe we can settle it with an arm wrestle. Is it true what Gary Hart says, that you and Walter Mondale represent the policies of the past? No. As a matter of fact-it might be in the past in that, to the extent that some of the things were principles that this country was based on-but I think that what we have done has been a departure, certainly from the past 40-odd years of Democratic domination in the country in which they have held both Houses of the Congress. ENTITY, can you give us some idea about what you would do in the next term to control the deficits? Are we talking-would you-are you considering possibly another increase, or an increase in taxes by changing the system, say, or would you make any further cuts in entitlement programs? We are looking at-and have been-and this is nothing new- Right. -what we think are so-called loopholes that offer not quite fair benefits to some and not to all. We have also discussed and I have asked the Treasury Department to look into something that cannot happen in this coming year, it is going to take more study than this, and that is a simplification of our tax structure. We need to look at ways to get the billions and billions of dollars that are not being paid in taxes-owed by people legitimately and not by way of loopholes; in this instance, just outright violations of the tax code. To that extent, yes, we are going to do that. But for the future, we have to bring down the percentage of the gross national product that government is taking in this country. See, I have a degree in economics myself. Now, that does not make me an authority, because I do not think economists are authorities; it is an inexact science. But I do remember that when I was getting my degree, it was more or less a standard acceptance in economics that the business cycle, so called, and the lean periods previous to that are-what we now call recessions and depressions-when they did occur, that usually it was when the government had gone beyond a certain point in the percentage of gross national product that it was taking. And that was just more or less accepted as standard. Well, I think it is very true today. And I think that after we get what we have called a down payment, which is about all we can get in this year, with the limited time that Congress is going to be here, then I think, in a bipartisan way, we are going to have to continue to look at government, as to how, structurally, we can reduce the share that government is taking. Can you give us an idea, though-I mean, could you give us some specifics about what you might do? I mean, what Well, let me give them to this extent. Some of them you could look at, and they could be contained in the Grace commission-or committee reports. Here was a look at government by almost 2,000 top business leaders in the private sector-not only from institutions and so forth but from the business and financial world-that looked at government as they would look at a business if they were thinking of merging or taking it over-as to things that are wrong or that could be changed. And we are really seriously looking at these recommendations, 2,478-or -28?-but anyway, it is almost 2,500 recommendations that they have made. And many of them would require legislative action, because they would result in changes in procedure in the processes of government. In the negotiations that have been going on in the last few weeks on this down payment that you referred to, what concessions have you expressed willingness to make? And what concessions might you be willing to make for your part in these negotiations? Well, frankly, I have lost a little faith in the bipartisan approach to this, because the other side seemed more interested, I think, in politics than they did in meeting us in any way on trying to achieve this down payment. So, I am and have been meeting with the leadership of our own in the House and in the Senate on that very thing, and will be willing, once we all come to agreement and have settled on a plan-and I cannot go beyond that, because we have not -but I will be willing then to go forward with our own proposal and hope that we can, with the support of the people, that we can get bipartisan support for it. So, you are saying you have not even put forth a proposal yet? That what? You have not, even yet, put forth a proposal in these negotiations? I do not quite understand. Well, this is in our own discussions within, I might say, the family, meaning the Republican leadership, both the House and Senate and myself. We are discussing-and there are a number of viewpoints on figures having to do with spending reductions-and I think we are pretty much agreed on that tax revenues would be-if there are any-would be obtained from corrections in the tax program and not in any change in the rates. ENTITY, not too long ago your finance chairman in Mississippi, William Munger, was reflecting back on the Republican's defeat in the gubernatorial race in that State last year, and he said that in order for Republicans to do well in Mississippi, they had to attract black votes, but if they did the things necessary to attract black votes, they'd be going against Republican philosophy. Do you agree with that? No, I do not . No, I think everything that we have done in our economic approach is of benefit to everyone. I know that there are charges being made-I listened to the debate-that somehow our attempts at economies and all have penalized people who were dependent on government aid. That is a falsehood. The simple fact of the matter is we are spending more on help for the people and for the needy than has ever been spent before in history. Our budget cuts have been reductions in the increase planned in spending. We have not come to some place where we are spending less than had been spent. But, sir, blacks in Alabama say that they are not going to vote for you. They say they are going to vote for the Democrat, whoever he is. How are you going to counter what they perceive to be an administration that does not have their interest at heart? Well, you said the key word, that they perceive to be. And I am just going to hope that in the campaign we can reveal to them that they have not been given the truth, that they are the victims of a lot of demagoguery that has portrayed us as guilty of things we have not done. Do you think that all the campaigning among eight contenders for the Democratic nomination has changed public perception of you along those lines or along other lines on Well, even before a campaign started, this has been pretty much the theme of the other side. I have been held up as eating my young, that we have been hostile to the poor and our tax program benefits the rich. How can a program that cuts taxes evenly, percentagewise, across the board-thus leaving the same rate of progression in our progressive tax system-how can that be beneficial to the rich and detrimental to the others? How can it be unfair to the people of lower income or the poor to reduce inflation from double digits-12.5 percent when we came here-down to a third of that or less, less than a third of that. When the people with the least-let us take someone with $10,000 of income between-through 2 years, 1979 and 1980-before we got here. By the end of 1980 that $10,000 would only buy $8,000 worth. He was getting $5,000 a year. He got a $1,000 cut in his ability to buy each year. That was probably the worst tax on the elderly with fixed incomes, the worst tax on the poor who have to spend most of their earnings on subsistence, on the necessities. The person with luxury income who spends a minor portion of it on necessities and the rest on luxuries, they were not really penalized as much by inflation. So, I think everything we have done has been beneficial to everyone at every level. You mention the elderly. If I could ask about that. The large elderly population of Florida-and they-many voters seem to be convinced that you, more than the Democrats, have been trying to restrain the growth or cut back entitlement programs such as social security and medicare. First of all, is that a correct perception? And is it possible in a second term that you would be advocating further cutbacks? I have said repeatedly that programs like that-there are things that need to be done, but we must never pull the rug out from those people presently receiving their payments from the program and dependent on it. You cannot suddenly undermine them or break your contract with them. Reforms, if there are such to be made, must be made, looking toward the future, on people not yet dependent and who would have plenty of time and warning with regard to such changes. Again, this was-if you will remember, that was the issue of the 1982 campaign. And nothing had been done. We were guilty of trying to tell the Congress and our opponents that social security was facing financial disaster and it could hit it as early as July 1983. They denied that. I remember hearing the Speaker of the House, himself, deny that that was true. And then after the election was over, we all got together in a bipartisan group and without any animus, came up with a plan to save social security because it would be broke by July of 1983. And we came up with that program. It was not a permanent answer to some of the problems, but it did buy us a great many years down the road before we would again be in the fiscal spot of that kind. Now, as to what we have done in social security since we have been here, the average married couple on social security has had a $180-a-month increase. So, I, again, do not think that we were double-crossing anyone. ENTITY, in 1980 West Virginia was one of, I think, half a dozen States that voted for Carter. And now, 4 years later unemployment is hovering around 15 percent, and the coal industry and the steel industry are ailing, and some Federal programs that West Virginians have depended on have been cut. What would you say to the guy in the street in West Virginia to convince him that he should vote for you in 1984? Well, first of all, we know that unemployment is never consistent with the national average. I described this to some of our own people a little while ago, that to think that it is like the man that drowned trying to wade across a river whose average depth was 3 feet. There are those pockets and certain areas that are going to be hit harder than others. But in the surge which-in reducing unemployment-which is greater than anything we have seen in the last 30 years-even those hard-hit areas are being benefited. More will have to be done. This is why we have for a couple of years now been trying to get the enterprise zone legislation through the Congress. And it is been blocked. This is a program-and I was amazed when one of the candidates in the debate last night started talking about we must look at tax incentives to help industry and so-forth put people back to work. Well, that is what the enterprise zones are all about, picking those hard-hit spots, both rural and urban, and generating employment through the use of tax incentives. And so far, a number of States have gotten tired of waiting for the Congress to act and do it at a national level, and have put in their own enterprise zone programs. And every one of them is proving tremendously successful. But, knowing that you might get around to unemployment, I just decided some figures might be of interest to you. You represent two, four, six, eight States-and all in the same region. In every one of them the figures for the peak of unemployment, and the figures for-I cannot give them to you except for one State now-but in December, as of the December level of the comeback, were considerably down from the peak. And in the State that you just mentioned, your own, at the peak, unemployment in West Virginia was 21. By December it was down to 15.7. Now, I do not know what it is today. We will not know for awhile, because when the Labor Department gives you the overall statistics, they do not break it down to States at the present figure. It takes them awhile to break it down as to States. So, all I have are the November figures, except for Florida, and that is because they do break it down for the 10 most populous States earlier than they do for the rest. Florida was 8.6 at its peak-or, wait a minute-Florida was 10.4 at its peak, and in December was down to 7.5. But to give you an idea of what the rest of the figures may look like when we get them-for the present, Florida is now down to 6. Ours was at 11.4 in December and in January was back up to 13.5. I mean, some of that has to do with seasonal- That is Arkansas? Alabama. Alabama. Alabama, yes. It is creeping back Well, at the peak- It is creeping back up. Yes, but at the peak you were 16.7. In December you were 12.3. Now, I do not know what the present one is- Well, in January it was 13.5. 13.5. Well, I think there'll be these fluctuations. I will be very interested in seeing what it comes out as from February. Is there anything else that you think that the States could do to help pull themselves up? Well, I think most States, as far as I can see, are doing all they can, just as we are. Maybe-and, you know, all of your States, particularly there in the Sunbelt, you are going to have to recognize also that your reduction in unemployment may be a little slower because of the migration to the Sunbelt. And that means that newcomers coming in, without jobs and looking for jobs, are temporarily going to distort the figures. Back on the economic issue for just 1 minute, back to the budgetary thing-when you campaigned for ENTITY, one of your promises, of course, was to balance the budget by 1984. Obviously, it is not balanced. I wonder what you look at as the main reason for that. What happened to Reaganomics that made it not work like you wanted it to? Nothing happened to Reaganomics. And I am glad you asked this question. Yes, I had the help of some of the finest economists in the country in working on the program that I call the economic recovery program. And toward the end of the summer, 1980, I announced that plan, and based our projections-that, yes, it could balance the budget by '83, based on all the projections that those economists at that time-before the election. Between that announcement and November, that projection was no longer valid, because the economy in 1980 was deteriorating so fast, and had not been projected to do so by any of these notable economists. No one had. So, it continued to worsen, and by the time of the Inaugural-then even a later time-was beyond any prediction; it had continued to get worse. That was when interest rates were 21.5. Inflation, then, for '79 and '80 had been double digit both years. Now, when I started-you have got to remember that the ENTITY comes in not with his own budget. You are still bound until the following October by the budget of the previous administration. Nor was my program in effect. We were still trying to get it. And in July of 1981 was when the further big dip came. Now, some economists have said, well, we had a 1979, '80 recession, and then the thing that happened in July was another-a different recession. Well, I do not think so. Things were-it was a continuation. And the bottom fell out with the interest rates that stayed high, the automobile industry, the housing industry-either one of which can start a recession by itself. So, nothing of what happened and the great surge to 10.8 percent in unemployment-none of that could be attributed to our program, because our program had not started. And then, as our program was implemented-and remember, it was only implemented in stages. It took 3 years to get the 25-percent tax cut. Other things that were implemented-and we never got all of the spending cuts. As a matter of fact, we got a little less than half of what we asked in spending cuts. And that is to this day. Now, I could turn around and say that maybe the recovery might have been even better if we had gotten-remember that one stage of our tax cut-10 percent of it-was going to go into effect retroactively to January of 1981, and we did not get it then. And when we did get it, after the drop had occurred, it was only 5 percent, and it did not go into effect until October, which meant that it was about 1 1/4 percent when it only went on for 3 years-or 3 months. And so, I have to say that all of the recovery has taken place after our program went into effect, and none of our program was in effect when the bottom fell out. ENTITY, I want to get clear on one thing. Are you-your comments earlier about this bipartisan-bipartisan meetings over the deficit-when you said you are now pursuing your own plan with other Republican leaders. Are you saying that you have abandoned altogether any hope of reaching any kind of compromise with the Democrats? Are you through talking with them? Well, I-no. I hope that maybe when we come forth with this plan and say, Look, here is something now, we will tell you, we are ready to go with; here is a plan -I would like to have, because we cannot get such a plan unless we have bipartisan support. I would like to think that they would do it. But what I meant was that to sit down with them and start from scratch to negotiate, they were very unwilling. We had great difficulty getting them to even meet. And, finally, one meeting they just simply walked away on one issue and refused to talk. Then they came back. And it was not very encouraging to us. Can you still-you do not have any idea about how soon you might have a plan ready to put forward? Before, I mean- I am hoping- -before the elections, though. Oh, Lord, I am hoping very soon, not the election. We have got to move on this deficit matter and move fast. Some of your economic advisers have been saying for some time now, and Wall Street analysts, that we have got to do something about the deficit. And you have just said it needs to be handled or taken by the horns as soon as possible. But you have been saying for some time that-or painting the picture that things are going to be fine, things are going to be okay. And that is not exactly the picture that is come from some of your advisers, if we do not take control of the deficit immediately. And I am wondering- Well.- - how- - it is not an exact science. And some of the economists-and some of them, I think, are trying to scare the Congress into recognizing that we should be dealing with it. But let me just point some Not scare you, but the Congress. Not scare me, no, because, look, I am not one to underestimate the deficits. I have been talking about them for 30 years. Is it impossible for us to-well, no, you cannot remember; all of you are too young, so it would have to be history for you-but for almost half a century the other party has been in control, as I said earlier, of both Houses of the Congress. And Congress is the only one that can deal with these things. A ENTITY has a veto power, but ENTITY cannot spend a single dime. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives ENTITY the right to spend anything. But for almost this half-century we have every year run deficits. It was almost a trillion dollars by the time we came here. And there were many of us who opposed this. And we were told at the time that the national debt did not matter because we owed it to ourselves. That was the explanation. We were told the deficit spending and a little inflation was necessary to maintain prosperity. Well, some of us did not think that added up. And I can show you speeches I made 20, 25 years ago in which I said inflation cannot continue without going out of control eventually. You cannot go down this road. The deficit spending and the piling up of the debt that-it has never worked in history; it never will. Well, now, suddenly, with the big dip that came in July in that recession, with millions more people added-the unemployed, who became wards of the government, which increased the spending, but who were no longer paying the taxes, which decreased that; the very fact that we improve the inflation figure also militated against government revenues, because inflation is a source of tax increase. And we did not get-we did not think we could reduce inflation that fast. We thought that there would be higher revenues than there turned out to be because of licking inflation. Well, all of this, for them now to suddenly become aware of deficits-and yet, when you try to talk to them, what is the only answer that they have for curbing the deficit? Increase taxes. Well-and they will also agree to cut defense spending. Well, defense spending right now is down to a little more than a fourth of the budget. Defense spending, historically, the days of Jack Kennedy, was virtually a half of the budget. Under Jack Kennedy, it was 47.8 percent. So, the-and the increase in taxes-they doubled taxes in the 5 years before we got here. And the deficits increased, because when you increase taxes, they increase spending. And may I point to the 1983 budget resolution passed by the Democratic majority in the House. And they really did not think that it would ever amount to anything or be passed by anyone else. But, if you will remember, they described it as a reaffirmation of Democratic principles. And it did call for somewhere around $70 billion in increased taxes. But it also called for that much increased spending for new programs, social programs. So, this was where we philosophically just were in complete disagreement-that they think you can solve the budget deficit by increasing taxes. They do not even pay attention to the fact that this could subvert the recovery that we re now having and put us back where we were. But beyond that, they have made it plain, and, indeed, their own candidates talk of new spending programs. When you are oh the campaign trail, how much of an issue are you going to make of the school prayer issue and the abortion? Well, I am hoping that before I get out there that we will have the school prayer amendment passed in the Congress. And here again, the effort that is being made to portray that as someway, somehow we are talking compulsory prayer; we are going to compel the schools. I am sure there would be some schools-all we are asking is that they have the right to if they want to. Now, there may be some schools that'll decide not to. There may be some that'll decide they will. But I think it is a right that we had for the bulk of our entire history in this country. And it did not destroy the country at all. As a matter of fact, crime rates were lower, and we did not have drug epidemics, and all sorts of things. Let me ask a question about drugs. There is a lot of reports, including administration reports, that there are more illegal drugs coming into this country than ever, especially cocaine-much of it coming through Florida-despite intensified enforcement in Florida and elsewhere. Would you say that that represents a failure of that drug strategy? And what would you want to do to-would you be advocating anything Well now, wait a minute-I am going to have to ask, but-you know, I have to tell you something about this room. I do not know whether you have noticed it or not-out there in that center of the room under the dome, you kind of disappear a little on me. A mild-mannered reporter, I'd say. Oh, dear. I am having so much fun. I was asking about the illegal drug shipments into the country. Oh. And the evidence is that there is more illegal drugs coming in than ever before-at least in recent years and despite intensified enforcement in Florida and other places. And what I am wondering is whether you think that because of that that there is going to be a need to change the drug enforcement strategy, and whether the drug enforcement strategy that you have employed has been a success? Oh, well, wait a minute. Then this-if this is a new figure that I have not obtained-our task force in Florida, which is the first time that we have ever put the Federal Government, the State government, and the local authorities, the drug enforcement authorities, and the military involved in trying to head this off-this shipment from out of the country coming in-was so successful in Florida that this is where, why we went to 12 such task forces all around the country on our borders to try and have the same success. Of course, there is no question: When you have got the coastlines that we have got and the borders that we have, I do not think you will ever solve the problem totally by intercepting the drugs. The answer is going to be the kind that has Nancy down in Houston. To really be successful, you are going to have to take the customer away from the pusher. The customer's going to have to start saying no. And this we are embarked on also, as you know, with great efforts all through the country. But the figures that we have is that-and the reason for the rest of the other 11 task forces were-that we so slowed it down in Florida and reduced it in Florida, that they began seeking new entry points around the country. But we are the owner now of a fleet of cabin cruisers and yachts and airplanes and helicopters and trucks and cars. And down there, the last time I was in Florida I remember being taken into a big building there at the airport and shown what we had intercepted, but also on a table that was about the size of that desk, the first time in my life I saw $20 million in cash stacked up there in bills that had been taken away from the drugdealers. That had to hurt. But, no, I think the program is being very successful. But we know that it is a wholesale business. It is not just a fellow on a corner with something in his pocket to sell. It is coming in in freighters. It is coming in in airplanes and everything else. But we have stepped up our efforts and have been tremendously successful. Do you think the military can be used to stop, like, particularly some of the drug smuggling that is coming in on that Mobile corridor? It is being flown inland. What we used was we used their radar facilities; also their air surveillance for information that we needed. I do not think they actually participated in any of the arrests, but they provided the surveillance and the information for us. If they can see an enemy coming in, I can see that. I had just one final question for you related to defense. This year for the third year now you are requesting in your defense budget funds for chemical weapons production. And of course, Congress has narrowly defeated these proposals for the last 2 years. There is been a suggestion made in the last week by some Democratic House Members that any proposal for funding for chemical weapons should be tied to legislation requiring the administration to make a new initiative on talks with the Soviets on chemical weapons control. So, my question is, first, do you think that the United States is doing all it can in this area? Would you agree to a proposal like that? And also, do you see any reasons now why Congress might be willing to pass the chemical weapons appropriation when they have not been? If they were responsible, they would, because the very thing that they are talking about we are going to be ready very shortly to table a treaty for discussion of banning chemical weapons. We know that is the way to go. But the reason why they would be more of help if they would okay the spending is, how better to get the other side, then, to agree to a treaty with us banning this; how much better able we will be if they know that if they do not do that, they will have to face the fact that we have chemical weapons that we can use against them. In other words, it is the same as in the nuclear field. It is a deterrent. So, this is exactly our own plan. Yes, we want to get them into a verifiable treaty banning chemical weapons. ENTITY- Would you agree to having it written into the legislation? What? Would you agree, then, to have it written into the authorizing legislation that the U.S. would have to do this? I do not know whether that would-I do not know whether that would help or not. There would not be any reason why we should not be willing since we, ourselves, are working on such a treaty. It serves them right. Thank you, ENTITY. Have you talked to Mr. Wick just lately about the possibility of his resigning? Has he sent you a letter of resignation or anything? No, not a kind-there is never been a hint of it. I do not know where that rumor came from. Not a word of it. So, he is not spoken to you - No. - and you still think that he is -you still want him to stay on. I sure do. Yes, he is done a great job. Would you like to hear about your own States, since I talked about a few of them? Alabama: 16.7 down to 12.3. Arkansas: 11.3-and remember, these are December figures-down to 9.4. You know about Florida. You know about Georgia. Mississippi: 13.8 is down to 10. South Carolina: 11.6 is down to 7.9-only two-tenths of a point above the norm, or the average. 13.7 for Tennessee, down to 10.3. And 21 down to 15.7-and that was December. And we have done even better in January and February. Are you going to continue to insist on Mr. Meese as your nominee for the Attorney General's spot? Heavens yes. Yes. Questions being raised now about the Carter papers and about his loans? All of that-we happen to know that they sent for those when they could not get him on anything else. They sent for those from the Albosta committee. Those are part of the record that the FBI said, as far as they are concerned, there was no criminal action, there was no misdeeds, and closed the investigation. But you do not believe any ethical questions have been raised at all? I do not think he violated them. I have every trust in his ethics, and have known him for a great many years. And I think he'd make a fine Attorney General. Do you think the American people would- What? Do you think the American people would be able to trust him as Attorney General? Yes. I trust him more than some of the Senators that have been raising these issues.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsoutheastregionaleditorsforeignanddomesticissues", "title": "Interview With Southeast Regional Editors on Foreign and Domestic Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-southeast-regional-editors-foreign-and-domestic-issues", "publication_date": "12-03-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 241, "text": "ENTITY, you are being given worldwide acclaim for your foreign policy programs or foreign policy initiatives, but your critics are crying a lot. I mean, I am sure you have heard that crying recently that you, during the last 3 years, have not looked homeward and have not taken care of business at home. How do you respond to that? I think they are not telling the truth. I think that in the first place, I see the world as one great big market. And I think every time we export, we are doing something good. So, when I go like the other day to an EC meeting in The Hague and try to expand our agricultural sales, that are very important in Missouri; try to expand those around the world, I think that is in the American interest. Secondly, I think world peace is in the interest of your kids and mine and our grandchildren. And I am going to continue to work on that. Thirdly, I have a good domestic agenda program. But my problem is the liberal Democrats that control both Houses of the Congress want to try it some other way. So what I have to do is keep proposing and reproposing, make compromises as we did on child care and clean air and some of these bills that are important, and then keep fighting for my agenda: The crime bill, the transportation bill, and these other growth measures that I have talked about. But it is not easy. In foreign affairs, when we went to win a war I did not have to ask the leadership of the Democratic Congress whether it is okay. Hey, is it all right if I move this division there? Is it okay if we send Schwarzkopf here or there? I did not have to do that. I am the ENTITY made something happen. It is different on domestic affairs. You are always fighting some tired, in my view, tired, old ideas up there. Speaking of tired, old ideas, do you detect a swing in voters' mood in the country? Witness the defeat of Buddy Roemer in Louisiana, the rise of David Duke and the defeat of Dick Thornburgh, your handpicked guy for the Senate in Pennsylvania. Well, in the first place, the Buddy Roemer was a terrible blow because it gave rise to a very tough choice in Louisiana. But I have said publicly, and I will say again: I could not be silent in the face of a man who is an ex-Nazi, who is a bigot, whose past is full of racism. So, I have spoken out on that. And the only worry I have got on that one is will that help Duke or hurt him, because Louisianians are proud. I used to work over there. They do not like people coming in from outside telling them what to do. But when you have a man that denies the Holocaust or is bigoted against minorities, I have got to speak out. I owe the country that kind of moral leadership. On the Thornburgh matter, yes, I am concerned, but I also was delighted when Governor Florio of New Jersey said, This is a referendum on President Bush, the elections here. And we swept both Houses. So, there was some good news for us and some not so good. Do you think you might have to take the unprecedented step of backing David Duke's opponent, the Democrat? Well, I have done that. Yes, I have said that, that if I were down there I'd vote for Edwards. But, again, the risk on that is that you are counterproductive. But I feel so strongly that we must speak up against racism and bigotry, that I was pleased to do that in the sense that it is the principled thing to do. But I am not sure of the election effect. You are in an area with extremely high unemployment, and there are a lot of people who are struggling to make ends meet right now. There are the homeless and the hungry in this country, those who are in despair. It might be difficult for them to believe that the recession is truly over. Might you be getting a picture painted for you by your chief economic advisers that is rosier than it actually is out there in the jungle, in the real world? I do not think that is the case, but I think there is a danger of when you say the recession is over that people who are out of work -- and it is 6.8 percent or something of that nature -- misunderstand that. We had a period of growth in the third quarter, and the definition of recession is two negative quarters in a row. Well, we had a positive quarter. But what is happening is the growth is slow. It is anemic. And what we ought to do is pass some of the growth measures that I have got before this Congress to stimulate growth and move forward on things like home-ownership and tenant management and a whole new approach. But I am having difficulty with the leadership in the Congress, frankly. They are thinking old, tired thoughts. And the American people see this. I will take my share of the blame, but the American people are right when in survey after survey they blame Congress, as many as four times as much as the President. But this is not a question of blame; it is a question of trying to help somebody. And I will continue to reach out to Congress, but I cannot accept bad legislation that is going to hurt everybody in the country. There are 34 million Americans with no health care insurance. And the plan that is been recently offered by business and labor leaders, you are opposed to that plan. What would you say to those 34 million Americans who might seem to think that you are not interested in them getting health care? I'd say we are going to have a health care program. We have got some good programs under HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan. But there are 60 programs that have been put out. There is another one, maybe that is the one you are referring to today that came out, that Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford were on. The price tag on some of these are enormous. And we have got to have a comprehensive program where we do something about the costs that have accelerated so much and try, at the same time, to provide health care for all. The program, as I see it, that was proposed today looks very much like the one that they proposed in Massachusetts. And they put it in, and then the voters rebelled because it cost everybody way too much money. And we simply have got to be sure that when we get one, and we are going to have a proposal, that it is not going to bust the back of everybody else or put people out of work. You are concerned; so am I, about jobs. And you do not want to say to every small business, You are going to be rendered uncompetitive because the Federal Government is going to impose mandates on you. I know you do not want to aid and abet the enemy, but is there any Democrat that you would be loathe to run against in the next election? If there was I probably would not tell you about him. But, no, look, I have always said I will have a tough race. I am confident that I will prevail. And I want very much, if I decide to be an official candidate, to prevail. If you decide? But I do not go along with the common wisdom as to who is the toughest or not. The media frenzy back in the East I expect -- I hope it is kind of been avoided out here in this very sensible part of the country -- but they have picked some that they think are the toughest. But let the American people decide this. And let the Democrats sort it out in their own primaries, and then I will take on whatever they offer up. If you decide to run? If I decide to run. And I have said, though, and not being cute about it, that the only reason that I can foresee would be if I had some health problem. That came up last year, but I feel like a million bucks right now -- before taxes. Thank you very much, ENTITY.

{"id": 452, "text": "Mr. ENTITY, your Secretary of State talked yesterday of hard choices to be made on both sides. What are the main difficulties facing you and President Gorbachev as you sit down at the table next week at the summit? Well, of course, there is a cloud of tension because of the Baltic States. I determined long ago that it was important that this summit meeting go forward and be successful, and yet I would be misleading you if I did not say that the inability to get dialog going there between the Lithuanians and the Soviets does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the United States. Secondly, I'd like to think we can move the conventional force talks further along than they are now. I think in START we are in reasonable shape, although it will not be ready for a treaty signing. On the chemical weapons side, I think there could well be good news for the free world and everybody in the world if they share my concern about reduction and eventual elimination of chemical weapons. The European questions are not solved by a long shot. How, for example, does post-German unification Europe look? Who will be calling the shots? What is the role for the United States in terms of stability? So, all of these questions will be on the table, and I look forward to a very frank and full discussion. One thing I have found is Mr. Gorbachev will lay it on the table, and I think I owe it to him to let him know how we in the alliance feel and how we in the United States feel on our bilateral. Mr. ENTITY taking those one at a time, Lithuania and the other Baltic States are struggling for the kind of freedom and independence that is right at the heart of the American ideal. Are you in any sense embarrassed that your pursuit of arms control success is in fact preventing you from saying what you would like to say about Lithuania? The I do not think it is preventing me, because what I say about Lithuania is, Lithuania is entitled to self-determination, to determine their own future. You see, our country has never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. But where it could be a problem is some say because we feel that way and we do passionately and because talks are not going forward between the Lithuanians and the Soviets, therefore you ought to not have this meeting or set this summit meeting back. I do not feel that way. But I do not think it diminishes my personal commitment to freedom and democracy because we talk with the Soviets. I would give you an example. We talked to the Soviets when Czechoslovakia was not free and Hungary was not free and Poland was not free. And so, we have a broad agenda there. And I'd like to feel that Mr. Gorbachev wants to go forward with what he says he is for, that is, eventual self-determination. But I do not feel a conflict there. But if Mr. Gorbachev continues to deny the Lithuanians and the other Baltic States self-determination, the right to go independent, will you not be forced to sacrifice the arms control treaty at some stage? The You know something, I have learned long ago not to answer questions quite that hypothetical, with respect, because we can conjure up a lot of scenarios, good and bad, and answer; but that I do not think is helpful on the eve of his visit here. But believe me, I will have an opportunity, as our Secretary of State did just within the last week, to reaffirm the United States commitment to freedom and to self-determination. You do not feel that you are sacrificing Lithuania on the order of arms control expediency? The I do not think so. And our agenda with the Soviet Union has far more to do with a lot of other subjects, too, than just arms control. But may I answer your question with a rhetorical question? When we talked to the Soviet Union when Czechoslovakia was what we call captive nation Hungary was and Poland was were we sacrificing their freedom in discussing arms control with the Soviet Union? Now, the world would clearly say of course you were not , as long as we adhere to our principle of self-determination and freedom. So, that is the way I'd respond to my critics. And you are saying that arms control is the most important thing on your agenda, and you will go for that come what may? No, I am not saying that is the most important. That is what you are saying or suggesting or asking me if I am saying. We have a lot of regional problems that we discuss with the Soviet Union. We have the whole question of post-German unification Europe that is very, very important to the people in the U.K. and France and other NATO countries. We have the questions of German participation in NATO a vital question. So, I am not trying to set out for you priorities. Do I think arms control is important? Yes. Are we working with diligence to try to have a good arms control agenda? Absolutely. But I cannot tell you that is the only thing that drives the meetings between me and Mr. Gorbachev. I want to talk to him frankly about things in Europe and in this hemisphere, and I do not want these two gigantic ships to pass in the night because of misunderstanding. Finally, Mr. ENTITY do you think that Mr. Gorbachev is going to survive, that he is going to be the person you will be negotiating with in a year's time, given the pressures that he has from the democrats and the radicals on one hand and from the military on the other? The I am inclined to think the answer to your question is yes, but it is not my role as President of the United States to try to sort out who should lead the Soviet Union. In Mr. Gorbachev I see a man who has presided over dramatic changes in Eastern Europe that benefit freedom and benefit mankind, if you will, and so I give him credit for that. I see somebody who is talking about perestroika and reform inside and openness, glasnost inside the Soviet Union, and I give credit for that. But Soviet leadership is up to the Soviet people. And I do not think one's foreign policy can be determined or be predicated on one person cannot be. But I think most Western leaders feel that in Mr. Gorbachev we have a man with whom we can talk frankly, with whom we agree on many principles; a man who has many problems, internal problems, facing him I am talking about predominately economic problems a man who has tried to work with us constructively on many fields. So, that is why we are going to approach this summit with great openness, and yet there are outside events and you mentioned Lithuania outside concerns that put a little bit of a tension on this meeting. But in terms of my sitting down, up at Camp David, and talking frankly with Mr. Gorbachev, he is the kind of person you can do that with. And I believe that that is useful to every country that the United States deal in this manner with Mr. Gorbachev. But that is not to say we have no problems. Mr. ENTITY thank you very much for talking to the audience.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmartynlewisbbc1britishtelevision", "title": "Interview With Martyn Lewis of BBC - 1, British Television", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-martyn-lewis-bbc-1-british-television", "publication_date": "24-05-1990", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 305, "text": "ENTITY, it is 2 days to go until the deadline in Northern Ireland obviously a crucial week, the politicians still at loggerheads apparently. What is it that you want them to do now in this make-or-break time? I want them to remember how strongly the people voted for peace and for the Good Friday accords and to find an honorable resolution of the admittedly thorny problems. Because whatever the difficulties of going forward, they are very small compared to the difficulties of letting the peace process fall apart. Now, you say there are thorny problems, and that is the difficulty and especially the problem of decommissioning. Would you be urging the Sinn Fein to do what Ulster Unionists are urging Sinn Fein to do, to namely sign up to a timetable for disarmament and give a categorical assurance that the IRA will have disarmed completely by May 2000? I think that all the parties should fully comply with the terms of the Good Friday accords, and that is what I would say. I think that they all have to find a way we know what the problems, the legitimate problems the Sinn Fein have with the decommissioning issue. But it is an important part of the Good Friday accords, so there has to be a resolution of it that enables the leadership of the Unionists, Mr. Trimble and the others who have fought for peace, to survive, to sustain their position, and to go forward and get everybody on their side to honor the Good Friday accords, too. They can find a way to do this if they decide that the price of failure is far higher than the price of compromise. And I think there is a good chance they will do it; even if it is 11th hour, I do. Well, what about the Ulster Unionists? Their position has been that there has to be guns handed over, actual hardware, before Sinn Fein can go into government. Do you think they should be considering moving ahead on the basis of pledges rather than actually looking for the armaments? Well, I believe that on that score, Mr. Trimble is satisfied in these talks with whatever commitment is made, and I think they should give it a chance to work. One thing I would say to the Unionists is that they can always walk away from this if the commitments are not made at a later date. And they should keep in mind they can bring this down at any time by simply walking out if the commitments are not kept. So I think that if Mr. Trimble can be satisfied and they can work it through, then I would hope the Unionists would support him and give him a chance give this thing a chance to work. Now, this political deadline is also coinciding with the annual deadline that there is in Northern Ireland of the Drumcree march. As we speak, an announcement on the Drumcree march is imminent. There are extremely strong indications that the Orangemen will not be allowed to go down the Catholic section of the Garvaghy Road. How concerned are you about what the impact of a refusal to let the Orangemen go down Garvaghy Road could be, both on the streets and on the political process? Well, as an outsider, you know, to me this looks like the most difficult of decisions because it is there is enormous emotional content on both sides. It is not just a matter of a lot of people walking on a certain road. And I think however it is resolved this year, the most important thing is that the parties themselves try to find a larger, omnibus resolution for this that reflects the spirit of the Good Friday accords. Keep in mind, I mean, the spirit of the Good Friday accords is that both sides should have respect for and get respect from one another, and that no one should have to give up his or her heritage or traditions, but they should be pursued with some sensitivity to how others feel as well. So I think that they are in a terrible bind now because the Drumcree deadline is coming up against the negotiation deadline. And so, however it is resolved, I think that what the leaders should be thinking about is, what is the long-run resolution of this? How can we show one another the necessary respect and sensitivity that will put this marching issue in the context of the commitment of the Good Friday accords, which is to push toward reconciliation and equality within the principle of consent? At the time of the Good Friday agreement, you waited up through the night in Washington, inside the White House, seeing how the negotiations were working out. You went on the phone personally and spoke to the main parties and tried to coax them forward. This week, with a new deadline, are you willing to do the same, to intervene personally? Oh, absolutely. I will do what ever I can to help. You know, this means a lot to me. It means a lot to the American people. We have tens of millions of Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants who are deeply invested emotionally, and many of them financially, in Northern Ireland, and would like to be more involved. And I also believe, as I have said many times, that if this can be resolved if we can get over this next hurdle and go forward I think it will give courage to the advocates of peace in the face of religious and ethnic problems in other parts of the world. You know, we are just getting off the ground with our efforts in Kosovo. There are many difficulties there, and the accumulated grievances there, from mass killing and mass uprooting, are deeper, if you will, just in terms of human loss than all the things that have happened in Ireland. But people have this sense that the divisions in Ireland go back such a long time, that if they can be overcome, I think it would give great heart to the proponents of peace in the Balkans and Africa and the Middle East, because the new Prime Minister is about to announce a government there; we have a chance again to make progress and peace in the Middle East. And I think that from my point of view, as someone who is interested in not only the country of my roots but the rest of the world, I think that it is hard to overstate; it is hard to overstate the impact a positive or a negative outcome could have on such actions in the rest of the world. Finally, ENTITY, there is only so much that you or, indeed, the British and Irish Prime Ministers can do to coax people along. Is this the time when Northern Ireland's political leaders have to stand on their own two feet? Well, I think they can know that we can coax them, and we can stand with them, and we can support them, and we can bring them benefits in all kinds of ways after this is resolved. But in the end, the leaders have to decide. Their people have voted for peace. But that is a general principle; the particulars are always difficult. And again, I would say, I think the important thing is to keep this going. Somebody if there is the necessary commitment given by all sides, and then, later, any of those commitments are not kept, this thing can always be brought down because the commitments were not kept. But I think it would be terrible to let it come apart now, before we get to see and feel how it really works. ENTITY, thank you very much.

{"id": 147, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for having us in this very famous Oval Office. When our group discussed the framework of this interview, it was very hard to achieve a consensus regarding the priority of questions. We hope there will be no such problem at the summit meeting in Bonn, which is, of course, the main purpose of your visit to Europe. The world is faced with the problem of if the economic momentum can be sustained and secured after the great locomotive seems to be slowing. How do you see the economic scenario in America and globally? And what would be, in your view, the best outcome in Bonn? What should be done at the summit meeting? I am not going to attempt to set an agenda for it. I know that we will be talking about political problems, we will be talking about this economic situation, and I know that our economic recovery did get out ahead of the others. I think one of the things that is of great importance that we want to be talking about is another round of trade talks, to resist the protectionism that raises its head every once in awhile and to see if we cannot come more and more to open trade between ourselves and other industrial countries. That will be, I am quite sure, prominent on the agenda. I know that in the last two summits we have also exchanged ideas about what we all can do to help in the recovery, and I am glad to see recovery beginning to take hold in those other countries. It will, hopefully, equalize the currency values and so forth. I know that just as one country, our own, can export inflation and economic problems, it can also export prosperity and help to the recovery, and I think that we are having a hand in that. Especially for Western Europe you recommended recently at the New York Stock Exchange, I remember, to follow your recovery program of '81 by cutting taxes, spending, and overregulation and throwing off the weight of government. What kind of tax cuts did you mean? Lesser income taxes or only incentives for investments and innovations? High tax rates do not necessarily mean high revenues for government. As a matter of fact, this, we think, was responsible for our recent recession-our government was taking too big of a share of the private sector. And I think that other countries-some of our allies and friends-are looking at themselves to see if this is the same situation. When we reduced the rates there was an increase, a surge in the overall revenues because of the economic expansion that resulted. Incentive, whether it is for business and industry or for individuals, does result in higher earnings. There was an Arab philosopher about 1,400 years ago by the name of ibn-Khaldun who said that in the beginning of the empire the rates were low, and the revenues were great. And he said at the end of the empire the rates were great, and the revenues were low. ENTITY, I wanted to ask you something about the dollar and the international monetary system. The dollar has lost in the past month about 20 percent of its value and before then, in a matter of a few weeks went very, very high, reaching high records against the Deutschmark and other currency. The monetary system, it is unstable and volatile. Your Secretary of the Treasury said that he was willing to do something about it, and it seems that something should be done. How strong is your commitment for a high-level monetary meeting, that should be hosted in Washington, and what concrete steps are you willing to take to improve this shaky system? Well, I am afraid your question is too specific for the answers that I have available at this time. Two years ago at the Williamsburg summit we all agreed upon embarking on a study-the European Ten, ourselves and others, our trading partners-and that study has been going on for 2 years. The study will be, and the report will come in in June, after the summit conference in Bonn. And I think when we get that report and see the recommendations and what has been proposed, then it can be determined whether a meeting of the kind that has been suggested is warranted and what the agenda would be, as that meeting would then take up the report of this 2-year study. So, until then I cannot comment on an agenda. So, are you backing off from the statement of Mr. Baker who said that Washington will host a- Oh, no. No, I think that this is also what he was trying to say-that we are perfectly willing, but we feel that we should wait and see what is the result of that study, what are we going to be hearing and seeing as a result of that. And of course, to the preface to your question there about the dollar declining, we think that that part could be attributed to the economic recovery of our trading partners. We think also that some of the fluctuation has to do with speculators, those people who read all the economic signs and then go running out and either buy or sell other currencies or our own. And that this can, on a simple buy-and-sell market, result in changes. Frankly, we were very pleased with the decline in value. Let me ask a question with regard to trade, ENTITY. How are you going to deal with the trade conflicts between Japan and the United States, and do you think that you have to berate Mr. Nakasone for his inability, even at the meeting of the Bonn summit? Well, we think we have been making great progress in the bilateral meetings that we have been having. I can tell you that Prime Minister Nakasone, I think, himself, is committed to a belief in more open and free trade between nations. I realize that, just as all heads of state do, he has some political problems, too, in opposition to some moves he might want to make. The same would be true of me here in our own country. But we have made great progress, and I think we will continue to make progress in opening up markets to open trade between allies. And I have a great admiration for what he is doing and what he has set out to do. ENTITY, in recent years your trade policy officials have made much of their efforts to promote the multilateral trade system. At the same time, they have used the possibility of bilateral deals with individual countries as something of a lever to bring other trading partners to the bargaining table. There are experts who suggest that subjecting a fifth or a quarter of your trade of the United States, external trade, to a deal, perhaps with Canada, could weaken the multilateral trading system. I am wondering: A, how you feel about that; secondly, what happens if there is a new GATT round? What happens to the bilateral deals at that point? Well, because of the direction the bilateral is taking between us and Canada, we have been, for each other, we have been the greatest of trading partners. Here we are with a very unique border that extends for several thousand miles with no guards or forts along that border. We have a pretty common heritage in this country. It is been reflected in trade, and sometimes there have been efforts here and there in particular areas to curb trade. Just as we are meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone, we have been meeting with Canada to eliminate some of the problems that, in reality, are peculiar to our two countries. And I do not think that that in any way does anything but even strengthen or add to our multilateral efforts. It just demonstrates that countries can mutually benefit from free and open trade. ENTITY, I imagine that there'll be a number of leaders in Bonn who would like to discuss with you your Strategic Defense Initiative during your visit there. The question I wanted to ask was that the British Foreign Secretary recently raised some concerns about your initiative. He warned that there would be no advantage in creating a new Maginot Line, which could be outflanked by simpler countermeasures, and he also suggested that the huge research program might acquire an unstoppable momentum of its own. I wonder what your reaction would be to those two points? Well, I think that is in a sense borrowing trouble. We are embarked on a research program. We do not have something ready for deployment; we are not talking about deploying. What we are researching to see is if there is an answer to the nuclear threat to all the world. We have a situation now between the major powers where we have a deterrent based totally on offensive weapons, and in our own country, it is called the MAD policy, and what it stands for is mutual assured destruction, meaning that-and to me, there is always been something a little immoral about that-that our deterrent is if you try to blow our people up, we will blow yours up. Now, in the whole history of the world, every offensive weapon has always led to a defensive weapon. We are doing a research-if we would come up with a defense that would, in effect, make nuclear weapons obsolete, I think it would aid in what we are doing in Geneva with our arms reduction talks: an effort to reduce greatly the number of such weapons in the world to the point that we do not leave as a heritage to our children this threat of destruction, literally of the world, if some madman comes along someday in one country or the other and decides to take that action. And I have made it perfectly plain that if our research-while I have any claim to it-is successful in any way, before there would ever be deployment, I would want to sit down with our allies and discuss this totally and share. And I have not even ruled out sharing with our potential adversaries. If we could substitute for simply an exchange of offensive threats, either totally defense or a combination of the two, so that we were not just living under this total threat that threatens even the rest of the world who might not even be participants-except in the destruction. Still on this subject, ENTITY, President Mitterrand of France has invited other European countries to joint efforts to create European technological cooperation. I was wondering what you think of this initiative and if you do not think that SDI has set the stage for a technological confrontation between Europe and United States? I do not know that I can answer that. I imagine that I will be hearing about that at the summit, and I will be looking forward to the discussion of it. The only restriction we have ever wanted to place on technology is letting or giving that technology to a potential adversary, who then could use it to an advantage over us militarily. And that is been the result of COCOM, which we have with our allies in our restraint on providing such technology to the other country. I know that we, on SDI, we have invited all of our allies to come in and compete for contracts on the research and to participate in the research on that weapon. I think on that previous question, I left out something or other there that I should have said in addition, and that is that on SDI, also, that in the meantime-no, we support France and England in going forward on their own nuclear weapons. I think it is been made necessary. We are, as you know, going forward with ours-with the MX, with the B-1 bomber and even a bomber beyond that, and with the Trident submarine-because that-to use one of our own expressions, that is the only game in town. Now, did I finish with yours? Well-no- -we will just go on to-just to make ENTITY, NATO is today much stronger than it was in '81, when you assumed the Presidency, thanks to the United States. Well, thank you. But is NATO in these days strong enough? Is it strong enough? I think basically-for a deterrent, yes. There is no question we do not match the Soviet Union in its military buildup, either in the strategic or in the conventional. But I think in the sense of a deterrent that a war, trying to take advantage of their superior forces, they would face more damage than they would want to accept. So, I think that from a deterrent standpoint-yes. You stopped the stationing of the Pershing II in Germany. Is that only for technical reasons, or has it something to do with the Yes, we Geneva- -yes, we have not arms control talks? we have not stopped that on a basis of changing a policy-no. We are going forward with that plan. Those countries requested those weapons of us, and the Soviets have continued to augment their intermediate-range weapons that are targeted on European targets. No, we would like, in the talks going on at Geneva, we would like something that would indicate that they were willing to reduce those. You know, our original proposal on the intermediate-range weapons was total elimination, zero-zero. Well, we gained half our point. The Soviets agreed to zero for us, but not zero for them. But we are going to continue. Incidentally, I want you to know also that SDI and the research that is going forward is not just aimed at strategic weapons, such as a protection for ourselves. It would be very definitely a factor with regard to those SS20's, those Soviet intermediate-range weapons, for protection of the allies. Yes, ENTITY, we are going to have very soon in Italy local elections, and the Communist Party has said that if it should win those local elections, it would give them a political, national meaning. And they would want to be in charge of the government, to put a crisis on the Craxi government and have a new government headed by Communists. How would you feel about that? They were talking about NATO and all of this. How would you feel about the Communists taking the leadership in Italy? Well, if you look at any country in the world that is run by a Communist government, you see that the people are denied all the democratic rights that we and our societies have come to believe are democracy and are the rights of the people. I cannot quite believe that the Italian people, with their love of independence and freedom, would settle for what the Communist government would mean to them and would take away from them. So, I hope it does not happen. But if it does, from what I know of your people, I would think the Communists might get a rude surprise when they started to implement their ideology. And just one second about Europe, ENTITY. It seems that Europe is at a balance. You have asked Europe to take responsibility on the economic side, and it is also a quite balanced point of equilibrium from the political side. How strong do you feel that Europe should be united politically? And how do you feel about a unified European monetary system to balance the general equilibrium? Oh, I do not know that I want to get into things that are purely- Just your opinion. yes, between those countries. But it seems to me that, as you so graciously said about the alliance and its closeness now, it seems to me that there is a greater bond-certainly in Western Europe, which is all we can talk about-a bond, between the countries than I can remember in my rather long lifetime, a friendship, and now with the Congress that I will be addressing there that represents all the countries of Europe, elected directly by all the people of Europe, and the European Community-all of these things I think represent great progress. And the monetary system? Now, you are suggesting a single monetary European monetary system. European. I just do not feel that I could comment on that. I have not done any study on my own of what that could mean or what the problems might be. I just hesitate to comment. U.S. Trade Negotiations Well, let me throw out my question on trade. Do you think that the Bonn summit would be able to set early 1986 as a target for starting a new round of multilateral trade talks? Well, that is what we are going to ask for, that the trade round begin early in 1986. And I have a feeling that we are not going to be alone in that. I think there are others that want to see another trade round. So, I am hopeful that will be an outcome of this summit. Are you really optimistic about this result, outcome of Bonn? Well, so far everything has shown progress. There have not been very many setbacks in the sense of countries adopting more protectionist measures. My own feeling is that protectionism just leads to a restraint in trade and a lowering of prosperity for everyone involved. And I know in our own Great Depression back in the early thirties, I believe that depression was worsened and was maintained over a longer period of time than need be because our country turned to a thing called the Smoot-Hawley tariff. And I think that was a great factor in our decline. So, no, I think that all the signs-maybe the progress has not been as fast as we'd all like, but it has been progress. Just on that same point, ENTITY, if there is no agreement for a 1986 start to the GATT round, is it your feeling that another Smoot-Hawley can surface quickly, and it will be beyond your control? Is that what you are saying to the world? No, because I know that there are factions in our country, as there are in every country, who want protectionism. But I think the progress we have made so far and the economic recovery we are having, I believe we can defeat those protectionist factions. Now, what could happen if others suddenly adopted protectionism and strengthened the hand thereby of those people in our own country; I do not know. But I do not see any threat of that right now. The less-developed countries, of course, are not at the table in Bonn. They have a special interest in what takes place. Of course, their debt problems we all know about. Will you be pushing your fellow summiteers to perhaps drop their own protectionist policies with regard to the Third World? Textiles comes to mind, sugar quotas. I think it could help those countries. We have all expressed a desire to help the lesser developed countries. And too much of the time that has taken the form of just economic aid, handouts. I think that we should be directing ourselves more to helping them help themselves. And in that connection, I have to say, our own country, this country, has purchased more of the production, particularly manufactured goods, of the lesser developed countries than all of the rest of the world put together. And I do not think it is hurt us; our recovery continues. But your Caribbean Initiative, for example, explicitly excludes textiles. Why not include it? We have had a setup on textiles with regard to growth because-and this, I think, every country agrees on-that here and there, when an industry is faced with a crisis, a temporary situation, to help rather than let them go down to destruction. Yes, we have all done that, and we have done it. We have a steel program in our country that is only invoked in the event of unfair competition first, but also if it is leading to a disaster. And then we have temporarily invoked some regulations to help them get on their feet again. ENTITY, when Mr. Gorbachev took over as Soviet leader, Mr. Shultz greeted the event as a moment of opportunity for an across-the-board improvement in relations. Do you think that the killing of the U.S. major in East Germany and Mr. Gorbachev's latest accusations about the Geneva negotiations mean that we are now in for another rough period of East-West relations? Well, I think it was in keeping with what has been the Soviet attitude on other things of that kind, including the shooting down of the Korean airliner. We certainly, out in the Western World, I do not think can quite understand that kind of attitude. I think they missed a great opportunity to achieve some stature in the world by not admitting that this was a most regrettable thing and a tragic thing and extending an apology to the widow and child of the major and, yes, offering some compensation. ENTITY, it is been announced from Moscow that Mr. Gorbachev will come to New York for the United Nations session next September. Could you tell us today if you will meet him at that time? I'd be very willing to. I have expressed the belief that we should have a meeting, and his letter to me acknowledged that and said that he felt the same way. Now, I do not know what his schedule-he will be coming here for the United Nations-whatever it is, if that should be the time. I certainly could arrange mine to accommodate and have that meeting. And one of the reasons why I think such a meeting should take place is that I have always believed that people get in trouble when they are talking about each other instead of when they are talking to each other. And what will you tell him-to Gorbachev? What? What will you tell him when he comes? Well, I think that when we meet there should be some open discussion about some of these differences, some of the things that cause us all to be suspicious of each other, and see if we cannot get some things out in the open on the table so that we understand each other better. Thank you very much, ENTITY, for granting us this interview. Please allow me this last question. We Germans hope your heart is not too heavy after all these misunderstandings regarding your visit. Forty years after the Second World War, what message would you have for the people of the Federal Republic? The message that I would have for them, and particularly in this anniversary situation that is coming up, is one of recognition that for 40 years we have been friends. The summit meeting consists of the heads of state of countries that were 40 years ago bitter enemies. We are friends; we have been at peace. I would extend my own admiration for the democracy that the people of Germany have created in these 40 years, for their dedication to democratic ideals, and that would observe this particular time as one of recognition of the reconciliation that has taken place between onetime enemies and which we are more than reconciled-we have become close friends and allies. You will not comment on Bitburg, I guess. No, no. I am going to be a guest of your government, I am looking forward to the entire trip. The German people would like to welcome you very much. I am looking forward to it.

{"id": 490, "text": "You are giving a major speech in Paris in a few hours' time on what you describe as a new era of transatlantic union. And obviously, the picture in Europe is much more encouraging, it would seem, than a few years ago. What is changed, in your view, and what needs to be fixed? This is the what is changed is the we have gone beyond the Iraq period for two reasons. One is that Iraq is democracy is succeeding. People are beginning to see progress. And therefore, people that at least governments that felt like they did not want to participate in the liberation of Iraq have now wanted to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq. And their people are beginning to see some success. Maliki has moved things Stockholm and comports himself like a leader would, and he speaks hopefully about the future. Secondly, that there are a lot of issues that we are focused on that kind of send a signal that cooperation is necessary to change the conditions of the world for the better cooperation on AIDS, cooperation on malaria, cooperation on trade, hopefully, discussion about climate change, cooperation in Afghanistan. In other words, the agenda is varied, and it is profound. And my speech basically says that by focusing on these issues and by working together in a unified way, we can be trans-formative, just like we were in the past. Europe used to be inward looking right after World War II necessarily so to rebuild. America helped. Now we can be outward looking as we help others. I also have a I am a believer that liberty is transformative the power of liberty is universal, that moral relativism must be rejected, and that we have got to have confidence in liberty to help others so that we are more secure ourselves. And that is what the speech is. It is a hopeful speech. And one of the areas of Europe where liberty has been sort of partly transformative is clearly post-Soviet Russia. And you have had very strong personal relationship with Putin. First of all, is your assessment that Putin is still basically in charge? And how important is your personal relationship? Let me start with the second. My personal relationship is important because we had differences. And therefore, if you work hard to establish a relationship of trust, that you are then able to air out your differences in a way that is respectful of the other person, and at the same time, find common ground. One area of common ground that has really not been given much attention is Iran. I agreed that the Iranians should have they have the sovereign right to have civilian nuclear power. Putin obviously believes they should; witness the cooperation on Bushehr. We both agree, however, that they cannot be trusted with the knowledge that comes from enrichment. And therefore, Putin suggested to the Iranians that Russia provide the enriched uranium necessary to run their fuel plant. I agree. And as I said yesterday in the press conference, that this really undermines the argument for the Iranians because if, in fact, their only focus is on civilian nuclear power, they readily accept the plant, the fuel, and the offer of Russia to pick up the spent fuel. So there are areas where we cooperate, and there are areas where we have disagreements. And yet I believe the best foreign policy for the American ENTITY is to be in a position to earn the trust of those where there is not a hundred-percent agreement. And by the way, any American ENTITY will find out there is never a hundred-percent agreement, even with your closest friends. I am sure that is right. And so the first part of the question yes, look, I think it is I went to Sochi. Putin introduced me to Medvedev. And he, in not only his body language, but in his words to me that Medvedev is going to be in charge of foreign policy. And their relationship is being sorted out, and the world is fascinated to watch what is happening. I think it is I will take him for his word, and then we will watch and see what happens. How concerned are you about issues like human rights in Russia? And what degree of influence does any outside country even the United States or Oh, I think it matters. I think it matters when people speak up, whether it be in Russia or China or anywhere else. In Russia's case, there was early on in my Presidency, I remember talking to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Catholic Church, where there were concerns about the Church being able to have a robust presence. Vladimir Putin is sensitive to religious issues. He is a religious guy himself. He has a beautiful little Orthodox church on his own property, which he proudly showed me and Laura one time. He made sure I met some of the Jewish community when I was there in Russia. And so he is sensitive to religious liberty, more so than some other countries. And is Western leverage reduced by the fact that Russia has a good chunk of the world's natural energy resources? I think it certainly changes the equation on a lot of foreign policy. It is interesting to watch the European Union wrestle with energy independence. Early in my Presidency, nations were saying they were going to get rid of nuclear power. And I questioned them quietly, on an individual basis, about that decision, because if you get rid of one source of power, you have to find another source of power, unless, of course, you do not care whether your economy grows. Most leaders end up caring whether their economy grows. So I predicted to some of these leaders that there would be an issue in terms of having a sole source supplier, particularly of natural gas from Russia. And now there is great consternation within the EU. And my only point is, is that this energy issue complicates a lot of foreign policy issues, including that between the EU and Russia, as well as that between the United States and Venezuela, or the world and Iran. And the question is, what do you do about it? Well, that was going to be my next question. What we need to do about it in the United States is to get this Democratically controlled Congress to allow us to explore for oil and gas. We did an energy study when I first became ENTITY that predicted it would be an issue if we did not explore for oil and gas. And what people do not understand is hydrocarbons are necessary as we transition to a new era, based upon new technologies. But new technologies do not arrive overnight. I mean, they just do not suddenly appear. It takes time and money to develop these technologies. The world is in the process of doing that. The United States is spending a lot of money on research, both privately and publicly. Japan is as well. And yet we forgot the notion of transitioning. And so we do not explore in ANWR, we do not explore for oil shale, we do not explore off the coast of America, and we should be. In terms of the oil price, which is obsessing most of the world now, is there anything individual governments can do, in your view? There is no magic wand. It took us a while to get to where we are; it is going to take us a while to get out of it. And the truth of the matter is that there is either got to be more supply or less demand. And demand does not decline overnight, although patterns and habits are beginning to change in the United States. You notice some of these car manufacturers are now announcing they are going to be manufacturing smaller automobiles. I think that people have got to recognize that, I mean, our policy in America has been robust on the development of new technologies and weak on finding enough hydrocarbons so that we can become less dependent on foreign sources of oil. In terms of the short term, fixing the oil price You mean the magic wand? Yes. No, there is not one. And in terms of these conferences, I notice there is going to be a conference in Jeddah, and your national security staff That would be Hadley, the spokesman. Yes, indeed not unreasonably said that you would want to know what such a conference I was asked this at a press conference last night. I said it is an interesting idea. Of course, I am going to go home and take a look at what it all means, and I will decide who is going to attend on our behalf. But if I might repeat, the solution to the price of hydrocarbons is either more hydrocarbons or less usage of hydrocarbons. During my trips to the Middle East I have got great relations with the leaders there, and I talked to King Abdallah about increasing the supply of oil, on the theory that if you harm your consumers with high price, they will find other ways to power their economies as quickly as possible. And secondly, he should not want to see kind of a worldwide contraction as a result of consumers spending money on energy that ends up overseas, as opposed to spending money on opportunities in their respective economies. So I think people, if they take a sober look at the world's supply, there is just not a lot relative to demand. One of the things that could help is that if some countries, big consumers of hydrocarbons stop subsidizing their populations so that there is a response to price on the demand side. Iran has been very much on the agenda again, all this week Yes, it is. It should be. and should be. Ahmadinejad has all but said no to the latest incentive package. If that stands, what is the next step in your view? More sanctions. The next step is for the Europeans and the United States and Russia and China to understand diplomacy only works if there are consequences. And sometimes the world tends to focus on the process as opposed to the results. And I have tried during my Presidency to say, we need to focus on the results. And for diplomacy to be consequential, there has to be a statement that says to the Iranians: Here is your way forward; if you choose not to, there will be a consequence. And the consequence in this case, in the diplomatic channel, is sanctions that are effective. So we will work with our partners on implementation of the sanctions thus far in place through the U.N., and work with them on additional sanctions, including through the U.N. process, as well as through the financial process. What is at stake here? Sorry, go on. On the theory that there are people inside Iran who, one, are suffering as a result of the decisions their Government made; but secondly, leaders inside of Iran who are sick and tired of the isolation brought about by this regime. In 2003, the Iranians had agreed to verifiably suspend; we had agreed to say, there is a way forward, working with our European partners. In other words, there was a looked like a successful way forward for both sides of this debate. Then Ahmadi-nejad gets elected, changes the tone and changes the policy. And so my only point there is that and this is the point I make to our partners is that the Iranians had adopted a different attitude during my Presidency in other words, in the relatively near past and that is not to say they cannot do it again. And now is the time. And the consequences of Iran having a nuclear weapon are substantial. They are substantial in the Middle East. If the people in the Middle East do not think that the United States and Europe, for example, are going to work to provide security, they will find their own ways to secure themselves. And what the Middle East does not need is a nuclear arms race. It does not need the instability that comes from an innate fear that the West is not strong enough or willing enough to take on the problem. So there is a lot at stake here, in your view. In my judgment, it is the international issue that faces all of us. And therefore, success in Iraq is important; it has consequences for the Iranian issue. It is important for us to have security agreements with our friends. We, the United States, has security agreements with UAE, for example. When you go to the Middle East and you sit in my seat and listen, yes, there is concern about the Palestinian state. But the dialogue has shifted dramatically from solve the Palestinian state and you have solved the problems in the Middle East, to now solve the Iranian issue and you solve the problems in the Middle East. Let us assume that Ahmadinejad does not respond to this latest package, that there are additional sanctions. You clearly feel very strongly about this issue. That is why I put all options on the table. And there are other options, obviously. What happens if at the end of the year, you have tougher sanctions, but you still have no resolution? I do not want to speculate on that. My hope is, is that let us get the tough sanctions in place. That is the task. But there is always an alternative on the table; there has to be. Oh, yes, absolutely. And you And alternatives not just for the United States, alternatives for a lot of other countries, some of which the world needs to think about as we head into this arena. We do not want a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. That is an alternative But you would be willing to hand over a status quo which was slightly improved, i.e., tougher sanctions? Actually, it is not status quo because there is a multilateral forum in place that will enable ENTITYs to more likely deal with this issue. I have made it clear that it is difficult for the United States to achieve an issue in a one-on-one situation with people like Ahmadi-nejad or Kim Jong Il. I have changed the foreign policy of the United States to make it more multilateral because I understand that diplomacy without consequences is ineffective. And the only way to achieve consequences through diplomacy is for there to be a universal application, in this case, of sanctions. Unilateral sanctions do not work. You know, I tell my partners, we are asking you to sanction. I know you are sitting there saying to yourself, Well, it is easy for him to say because they have already sanctioned. And the question facing countries is, does money trump effective diplomacy for the sake of peace and security? Iraq, you mentioned. Postsurge, are things heading in the right direction, in your view? Absolutely. And how is Violence is down. And as a result of violence being down, the economy is growing and political reconciliation is taking place. And the lesson learned in this postconflict period in both Iraq and Afghanistan is, you got to have security. I gave a speech at the Air Force Academy that said it is a different set of issues that we face now than we faced 60 years ago in postconflict. First of all, the conflicts took longer to resolve in World War II, and yet the reconstruction was done in relative peace and security. Here it took little time to accomplish the initial military objective, and reconstruction had to be done in the face of a lot of violence. And in 2006, it became apparent that our strategy of training and encouraging the Iraqis to take the lead was not working; sectarian violence was severe. As you know, I made the decision to send 30,000 more in because we recognized that and had belief that security would yield this kind of evolution of democracy, and it is. The number of laws they passed, the Iraqi Parliament have passed, have been I would say it certainly exceeded expectations. And they passed their budgets faster than we have passed our budgets. I am sure that is true. The British Government, Gordon Brown had said yesterday, I think, that he will announce sometime in the coming weeks future plans for British deployment in Iraq. British officers have acknowledged that in the recent fighting in Basra, the American military role was crucial to making sure that there was a response. Is there not a concern that, whatever the justifications for a British withdrawal, that a British pullout of troops could have an effect either on American deployment or on the situation as a whole? Or are you relaxed about it? I am , first of all, appreciative of the fact that Gordon Brown is constantly in dialogue with us about what he and his military are thinking. Secondly, we ourselves are bringing out troops based upon return on success. And thirdly, I am confident that he, like me, will listen to our commanders to make sure that the sacrifices that have gone forward will not be unraveled by drawdowns that may not be warranted at this point in time. I am looking forward to discussing with him. We have had some discussions. He was going to be at 3,500, I think, if I am not mistaken; he is now at 5,000. National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley. I think he is at 4,200. Forty-two-hundred, I do not know, whatever, but it is But it did roll back on an It is greater than he thought, in other words Yes, that is right. In other words, the Government took a look and said, Well, maybe we ought to leave more troops in. My only point is, is that timetables you say, timetable for withdrawal, and our answer is, there should be no definitive timetable; there ought to be obviously a desire to reduce our presence, but it is got to be based upon success. All I can tell you is, from my perspective, the British response has been that way. They have said, we are going to have we think we will be at 3,500, but then adjusted their plans based upon the conditions. Iraq/ENTITY's Decisionmaking Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq obviously is Still looking for them. Still looking for them, exactly. That was a huge disappointment. And the obvious question your critics ask, particularly in Britain, is if we'd known at the time there were not any WMD, would there have been this war? Well, you know, that is one of those great hypotheticals that we did not know. Now having said that, I still strongly defend the decision. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. But ENTITYs do not get to do redos; they do not get to do look-backs, ifs. All I can tell you is, is that we thought for certain there was weapons of mass destruction, as did the nations that voted for 1441. See, the interesting thing about history is that short-term, kind of momentary history, is that people forget what life was like at the moment that this decision was made. One, people forget that we tried to solve this problem diplomatically. You might remember, there was a great debate: Will Bush go to the United Nations, or will they move without trying to solve this problem diplomatically? Well, we did go to the United Nations; I insisted we go to the United Nations. And we worked diligently from the summer of 2002 until March of 2003 to see if we could not have solved this. We went back to the United Nations for a resolution. For a second resolution, yes. And in the meantime, we are working with our allies and friends. We did not realize, nor did anybody else, that Saddam Hussein felt like he needed to play like he had weapons of mass destruction. It may have been, however, that in his mind all this was just a bluff. After all, there had been 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions, the world was not serious, which leads me back to the point that when the world says something, it better have it better mean what it says, otherwise people who are destabilizing just do not take it seriously. Who cares? they say. And so I was asked in Germany one of the guys said, You making any mistakes? Of course, I said. One of the mistakes was my language made it look like that I was anxious for war; that because of my language, I did not understand the consequences. Well, of course I understand the consequences. And I understand better than anybody that the Commander in Chief has got an obligation to comfort those who have lost a loved one because of his decision. And then the man went on and said, Well, was it a mistake to get rid of Sad-dam Hussein? The answer is absolutely not. You very movingly described in one interview this week that how difficult it is to put young American men and women in harm's way and how much time and energy you have tried to devote to doing what you can, obviously, to comfort the families of someone who has been killed And making sure they understand that the sacrifice will not go in vain. Nothing worse than a politician making decisions based upon the last Gallup poll when people's lives are at stake, or where they have made a sacrifice. And I tell these folks and they want to know look, there is a lot of them, and I have not visited with all the families. But I will tell you this: Many, many families look at me trying to determine whether or not, one, I believed that it was necessary; and two, whether or not I am going to let their son or daughter kind of lie in an empty grave when it comes to the sacrifice they made. They want to know whether or not the ENTITY if he believes it was necessary, whether or not he is going to see this thing through, regardless of what they are screaming on the TV sets. You are flying into Britain where your public awaits you, and you know there is a tough public there sometimes. One of the questions Do I care? Only to the extent that it affects people's view of my the citizens I represent. Do I care about my personal standing? Not really. One of the questions, of course, they ask, is, do you feel a sense of personal pain Course I do. over the Iraqi civilians who have I feel a sense of pain for those who were tortured by Saddam Hussein, by the parents who watched their daughters raped by Saddam Hussein, by those innocent civilians who have been killed by inadvertent allied action, by those who have been bombed by suicide bombers. I feel a sense of pain for death. I feel a sense of pain for the families of our troops. I read about it every night, or I used to read about it every night. The violence has changed. But I get a report every day about whether or not the U.S. has suffered casualties. And when I get those reports, I think about those mothers and fathers. And I meet with a lot of families a lot in order to be able to it is my duty to try to console and comfort. And many times, the comforter in chief ends up being comforted, by the way, by the families, the strength of the families. This is a volunteer army, and these kids are in this fight because they want to be in the fight. And they believe in it. And yet these poor parents are looking at oftentimes looking at negativity, just people quick to report the ugly and the negative. But it is hard to report on the schools that are opening or the clinics that are opening or the playgrounds that are filling up. The society is coming back. I have great faith in the power of liberty. First of all, I was not surprised when people went to vote in defiance of the killers. I was pleased, but not surprised, because I believe in the universality of freedom. I do not believe it is a Western value. And I say to people, I am concerned about the comfortable isolating themselves and saying, who cares whether somebody over there lives in a free society? And I will say in my speech, moral relativism must be challenged, this notion that it does not matter what forms of government are I think it does matter. I think it also matters, along these lines, that when I talk about freedom, it is just not freedom from tyranny, it is freedom from HIV/AIDS; it is freedom from malaria; it is freedom from hunger for two reasons. One, it is in our national interests that we defeat hopelessness. The only way a suicide bomber can recruit is when he finds somebody hopeless. And secondly, it is in our moral interests. A nation is a better nation when it feeds the hungry and takes care of the diseased. And therefore, when I go to the G-8, my message to the G-8 is, yes, we will talk about the environment, and that is important. But George W. Bush is going to be talking about those people who are needlessly dying because of mosquito bites. And I expect them to honor their obligations. We came to the G-8 last year, and I said: Why do not you match what the United States of America does? We are putting up $30 billion for HIV/AIDS, $1.6 billion for malaria. And why do not you match us? And they said, Okay. And so we are going to go to the G-8 and we are going to sit down and say, Have we matched? Because there are people needlessly dying today. And we will come up with a good solution for greenhouse gases by getting China and India at the table. And it is going to take time to evolve, but I am going to remind people we can act today to save lives for the good of the world. That means shorten my answers. No, no, I will shorten my questions. Just three very brief questions. First of all, your relationship with Tony Blair I am struck, in your last question, that you seem to share with him a genuine passion for ideas and that politics matter. How would you describe your relationship with Blair? I would say, first of all, it is a relationship forged by fire. We share as you can tell, I have this idealistic streak, and so does Blair. But we also understand that this idealism is a practical response to the world. See, this is an he understands, like I understand, this is an ideological struggle. These acts are not isolated acts of lawlessness. We are in a war. A lot of people hope this was not the war you know, just kind of dismiss it as, oh, there is some irritated guys, you know, just kind of making some moves. We viewed it as an ideological struggle that requires response through good intelligence, sometimes military, obviously, sometimes law enforcement, all aiming to dismantle and protect our people dismantle the cells and protect our people, but that ultimately, freedom has to defeat the ideology of hate. Was Tony Blair your poodle, to use the You know, look, this is the convenient one of the great things about Western press is that they oftentimes retreat to the convenient rather than trying to, you know, probe the depths of a relationship or the depths of somebody's feelings or the basis of philosophy. And so it is convenient. It is convenient to say, you know, warmonger, religious zealot, poodle. I mean, these are just words that people love to toss around foolishly. How do you think and how do you hope that you and Blair but particularly yourself how would you hope that the achievement what is your greatest achievement or your greatest pride as ENTITY? And what is your greatest regret? Well, first of all, just so you know, I am not going to be around to see it. There is no such thing as objective short-term history. It takes a while for history to have its you know, to be able to have enough time to look back to see why decisions were made and what their consequences were. So you know, I'd hope it'd be somebody who would use the influence of the United States to help transform societies by working on disease and hunger and freedom. And the liberation of 50 million people from the clutches of barbaric regimes is noteworthy, at the minimum Does this job take its toll on you? I mean, can you My spirits are pretty high. I mean, I am you got to believe, you know? You got to have a set of beliefs that are the foundation for your very being. Otherwise these currents and tides and 24-hour news and politics will kind of leave you adrift. And I tell people that when I get home, I am going to look in that mirror and say, I did not sacrifice my core beliefs to satisfy critics or satisfy pundits or, you know ENTITY's Future And what next a foundation, a book? Yes, I am going to think about that, yes writing a book. I am going to build a Presidential library with a freedom institute at SMU Southern Methodist University all aimed at promoting the universal values that need to be defended. I am very worried about isolationism and protectionism. The world has gone through these isms before. And you watch and see, the protectionist debate is mounting in the United States; it is mounting in Europe, certainly. It was much easier to kind of blame the economic woes on external forces, and therefore, the response would be, okay, let us quit trade, let us make sure our jobs are not going elsewhere, and that is some of those concerns are legitimate. On the other hand, it is a forerunner of isolationism, and you know, I remind people that we have been through a period of isolationism and protectionism right before World War II. And, by the way, curiously enough, at that period of time, there was nativism as well. And I find it interesting that the immigration debate is now pretty pronounced around. And so I am going to set up a this is not , like, you know, a headquarters for the Republican Party. And by the way, just so you know, the foreign policy I have just outlined for you is you know, it is not a hundred percent received amongst conservative thinkers in the United States either. Yes, I know, yes. Do we have 90 seconds? Ms. Perino. Yes. Okay, so Ms. Perino. I would say 90 seconds. Ninety seconds, okay. Just one very quick this is going to seem slightly flippant, but you are going to the greatest fan club of The West Wing television show in the world on Sunday. Since you are the only person who can review that program from experience I have never watched it. You are kidding. Why not? Because I do not watch network TV. I read. You read. Okay. And then the I seriously do not watch TV. You know, I watch sports, but I'd much rather read books. And I do, I read a lot. I may even read yours. And then the last question But I will not be able to find it because it is written by so-called written by the other guy. Q. Certainly true. Last question, which comes back to Iraq again. Gordon Brown and I thought your question on the pain you feel personally was quite clear and absolutely strong. Gordon Brown a couple weeks ago phoned a voter who was upset about Iraq, and apologized on behalf of the Government, not for the war, which he still thinks was the right thing, but for the kind of suffering of the Iraqi people. Do you think that is a wise thing to do? I think the Iraqi people yes, some have suffered, no question. But they are living in a free society. Everybody is going to have to handle their own internal business the way they want to. I am not going to second-guess one way or the other. But my view is, is that when you talk to Iraqis, they are thrilled with the idea of living in a free society. Do they like the fact that violence is still there? No. But every society reaches a level of violence that is tolerable. And has that reached Iraq? I do not know yet. But I do know life is improving. I do know they live under a Government that they helped elect, or they elected. And there is still a lot of work to be done, do not get me wrong, but and you know, the thing that people ought to focus on is the courage of the Iraqis. They put up with a lot of violence, Muslims killing Muslims. But first of all, there have been some accidents, but nobody can claim that the United States or Great Britain are intentionally killing innocent people. We are not. As a matter of fact, warfare has changed a lot. But the existence of the war has led to the deaths of innocent people, and the fact is It has, but before the war, hundreds of thousands were discovered in mass graves So on balance, you have Freedom trumps tyranny every time. And it is hard for people to see that. It is hard for people sitting afar to say, Is not that beautiful, somebody lives in a free society? And my point is, is that I think it is important for those of us who do live in free societies to understand that others want to live in free societies. And it takes time and sacrifice and effort to get that done. But one of the lessons of history is, is free societies yield of peace. I remind people, 60 years ago is not all that long. And to say that Europe would be whole, free, and at peace prior to the end of World War II would have been, you know, you would have been viewed as a hopeless idealist. Well, I am making the point that I when I gave my speech at the Knesset, if you read what I said, here is what 60 years from now the world can look like, and I believe will look like, unless we all retreat. It is not worth it, you know. And my point is, it is working. Good. Thank you very much.

{"id": 435, "text": "And thank you very much for joining us. We will , of course, be including your phone calls. The phones will flash on the screen. What a year. Biggest surprise? It was a little tougher to change things than I thought it would be. There was in this city a culture that I knew existed that tended to sometimes major in the minor and minor in the major, as you know. But I still found that if we stayed after it we could make change. It just turned out to be harder than I thought it would be. Adjustment tough? This is not Governor, right? No. It was not tough to adjust to the job. I like the job. But it is a very different life. And I was very concerned about how it would affect my family. Hillary and I wanted to-we had a good life before, a good family life, good work life. And we were very concerned about Chelsea, who loved her school, her activities, her friends at home. But I am proud of the transition she is made. And over the holidays when we were sort of reminiscing, we were most proud, I think, that our daughter had adjusted to her new school, made worlds of good friends, and has her ballet and other things. The saddest day had to be the loss of your mother-- Yes. --and no time to really grieve, right? She was real important to me. I loved her a lot. And the night she died she called me. We had a wonderful talk. And then I went home, and we put the funeral together. And then I went to Europe, and I came back, took a physical, and then went to California. So you have had no time to grieve. No real time, no. You remember when she called on your show? You were in Ocala. We were in Ocala, Florida, and you set me up. And you said, Where are you? My mother called me from Vegas. Vegas, where else? Last trip she took, you know, which is what she should have done. I saw some people who were with her the night before she died. You would have never known she was ill. She was all right. That had to be the worst; what was the best day of this year? And then we will discuss a whole bunch of things and take calls. What was your best day? Well, I think my best personal day was Christmas because we had our families here. And it is a family holiday. It is always very important to me. Hillary loves it. Chelsea loves it. And we had Mother here and her husband, Dick, and my brother and Hillary's family. It was good. Best political day? Best political day, that is tough. Probably the passage of the economic plan, because it made possible all the other things, the victory of NAFTA, the GATT agreement, the passage of family leave, national service, all the other things. If the economic plan had not happened, we could not have turned the economy around, and we could not have had all those other successes in Congress. Let us run down some things real current. You are just back from L.A. Apparently it is going to rain there this weekend. Are they going to have tents outside for those people? They are working on that. They are also working on whether we can get some more trailers in and other things. What was that like to go there? I mean, we were there for it-- You were there when it happened, so you know better even than I. But I must tell you, standing on those pieces of broken interstate highway and to realize that happened in a matter of seconds, that massive- tons and tons of concrete moved, and then, of course, seeing all the homes ruined and businesses cracked open, it was an amazing thing. What is a ENTITY's role there? Well, I think the first and most important role is to assure that the federal emergency management program is working, that we are getting the emergency help to people they need, the food, the shelter, and the money in some cases, people have lost everything; secondly, that we put in motion the rebuilding process to get housing to people and to deal with the longer term needs; and thirdly, that in the case of Los Angeles, that we start rebuilding those highways as quickly as possible. You know, it is a highway-driven place, southern California. We are finally beginning to get the economy turned around out there, finally, and then this happens. So we have got to do this in a way that does not upset the economy. There are some, as you know, among us in America who will say, Well, it is their problem. They chose to live in that area. That is an area where earthquakes occur. Why should Des Moines pay? Well, because California paid for Des Moines when we had that awful flood. Americans are normally at their best in times of grave natural disaster. And I must say, after all the people in California have been through- they had the riots, and then they had the fires, and they have had all the losses of jobs because of the defense cutbacks and the national recession-to have this put on them. And yet I met so many brave people. I met a women who said, You know, I lost my house, but I'd like to say I hope nobody will take advantage of the Federal Government. Do not apply for aid you do not deserve. Do not ask for something you do not need. Somebody else may need this later in the year. That is the kind of spirit you get. And I would hope that the people of America would want to help those folks who through no fault of their own were really dislocated. I also would tell you when there is a severe economic disruption, whether it was the Middle West because of the horrible floods in the Mississippi River Valley and the adjoining rivers or now southern California in the case of this earthquake, it hurts the whole rest of the American economy. So we have got to be family in emergencies. And I think that is what America wants to do. All right, switching gears. What do you make of the Bobby Inman story? What happened there-Safire, Dole, that explanation? I do not know. You may know as much about that as anybody. All I can tell you is that I accept his statement. He made a decision. I do not think we should lose sight of the fact that he was a four-star admiral. He gave 30 years of service to his country. He was confirmed by the United States Senate four times. I just-- You think maybe he really did not want the job? Down deep inside, I think maybe he was not sure he wanted to go back. There are a lot of people-I had a Cabinet member tell me the other day that if he had to do it all over again, he was not sure he would go into public service today because Because? --it is just too brutal, what you are put through. That is what he said. Are there days you think that? Not for me, no. You like it too much? I like it. But the only thing I have ever cared about on that is my family. You know, when Hillary or Chelsea get hurt or when my mother was hurt by something that was said or done, that really bothered me, especially for Hillary and Chelsea. They really did not sign on for all that. But for me, I figure, if you look around the Western world and you look at the recent history of the United States, if you sign on for a political career in the latter half of the 20th century, you just have to expect a level of that that did not exist before. Goes with the territory? Yes. And so I always say, if you want to get into this business, you need to know who are, what you believe in, and where you stand with what you believe because you cannot let yourself be defined by what happens outside. The reports today are that it was offered to Sam Nunn and he declined. True? Well, I cannot discuss that, otherwise I would have to deal with all the other personalities I have considered, and so I do not want to discuss personalities. Would you say he would be on the list? I will say this-that he would be a great Secretary of Defense, but he is got an awfully influential position now. We have been friends a long time. But let me just say this: I am going to proceed in a deliberate but fairly quick way to name a Secretary of Defense, and then I will talk about the process. Is it a short list? Yes? Why in this year did we have so many appointment problems? First of all, I think most of it was because the rules changed on the household help issue. That had never been an issue before. And all of a sudden it was a big issue, and the press was pillorying people that had the problem. And it was a problem. And so we had to get that worked out. I do not think it will ever happen again now because now there are fairly clear rules: if you have had this problem but you pay your taxes and then now you will not be-so that was the first big problem. The second thing was that people's writings became an issue for jobs other than the Supreme Court. That is, Judge Bork's writings were an issue but that is because the Supreme Court got to read, interpret the Constitution, and it was a lifetime job. The Senators and others decided this year that they'd make that an issue for everybody for confirmation, which I think is a questionable standard, but it did. You are talking about Lani Guinier and-- Yes. And one or two others that became an issue even though we got a couple through. So I think that these standards are always being raised and heightened. And I think, frankly, the process takes too long now. I talked to several Republicans and Democrats who have no particular axe to grind now who think maybe it is time to have a bipartisan look at this whole appointments process. It is entirely too-it takes too long to get somebody confirmed. It is too bureaucratic. You have two and three levels of investigation. I think it is excessive. In that area, are we going to get a Deputy Attorney General for Civil Rights? Well, I certainly expect one soon. The civil rights bar basically was heavily involved in the nomination of the last candidate who withdrew. And the Attorney General is working hard on it. And basically I have given her my proxy on the thing, Just work with them. Work with people who are committed to having a strong civil rights enforcement. Interestingly enough, last year just when the Attorney General herself was in office and we did not have a full-time director of the division, civil rights enforcement was way up at record levels in many areas. So we have got a good record, but I think it is important to have somebody in there who is good. So you are giving Janet Reno a proxy meeting-if she comes to you tomorrow and says it is Joe Jones -- This is the person I'd like to nominate, unless there is some reason that I should not , something I know that she does not know, then I will be strongly inclined to go with her judgment. Of course, in your popularity ratings, which, congratulations, keep going up- went up today-you scored the highest in the area of race relations. Does that surprise you? No. I think the American people know how much I care about it. It is been a part of me ever since I was a little child. It was a big part of my work as Governor. And I think the American people know that I am committed to both equality and excellence, that I want people without regard to their race to have a shot at the brass ring in America. And I think also the American people know that we cannot solve the other problems, the crime, the violence, the family breakdown, all these other things, unless we reach across the racial divides. We just cannot do it. We are not going to make it if we do not . About Ms. Reno-we keep reading-she goes up and down, and again these are pundits who say this. Where does Janet Reno stand tonight, one year in? I think she is terrific. I told her when she was hot as a firecracker, you know, with the public and with the press when she got here, and I was joking with her once, I said, You know, Janet, you go up and you go down in this business, and if you stay out there long enough, you will take a few licks. And she is taken a few licks, but she has an enormous feel for simple justice, which is what I think people want in the Attorney General. She is got a steel backbone, and she understands what really works. She, like all the rest of us-none of us are perfect; we all make mistakes. But boy, she goes to work every day and really tries to do what is right for ordinary Americans. So she is staying? If it is up to me, she is. I think she is done a fine job. Rumors are part of this scheme. Warren Christopher, is he in strong? I think he is done a good job. And I think if you look at this last trip we took to Europe, and you look at the work that he has done, along with others in the national security and foreign policy team, the United States was very well received in Europe on this trip. They know that we are trying to unify Europe for the first time in history. Never in the whole history of Europe has it not been divided. The divisions of Europe caused these two awful World Wars in this century, caused the cold war. We have got a chance to unite it. We may not make it, but we have got a chance to unite it. And he is the right man in-- And he has worked hard on that, that is right. And I think he is really done a good job with the Middle East peace. He is managed this process. He is been to the Middle East a lot. And he is got good strong support at the State Department. So I think he is done a good job. What do you make of Mr. Yeltsin's grip there-strong? On a scale of 10, where would you rate it? I think he is got a strong grip because he is got a 4-year term and a constitution which gives him more power, for example, than I have here, just pure legal power. I think that in the last election, a lot of people who are not friendly to some of his policies did very well, partly because the reformers did not campaign as one group and did not do a very good job in the mass media and all that sort of stuff, partly because the average Russian's having a tough time now. One of the things that I did when I was in Russia, and you know, through that town meeting-kind of like we do-and let people ask me questions, and I tried to establish some link between them and these processes of reform that are sweeping the world. Because times are tough for them now. And I think anytime times are tough-and keep in mind, they have just been a democracy a little while. We have been at this 200 years. And we kind of feel haywire from time to time, and we have been working at it for two centuries. They just got started. And so they elected some pretty extremist people and some people that are calling them to a past that is romanticized. And I think he is going to have a challenging time. But I think if they-he is a very tough guy. He believes in democracy. He is on the right side of history. And I think he will continue to listen and learn and work, and I think he will do-- On the first anniversary of his Presidency, a special edition of Live with ENTITY. Some more talks and questions from me, and then he will take your calls. Do not go away. We are back to this talk with the ENTITY on this one-year anniversary. You will notice that the White House is not as brightly lit as it is normally lit. The lights are a little dim. That is because we are in a winter-terrible situation here in-you cannot -you have a lot of power, but you cannot do anything about ice storms. You cannot do anything about zero degrees. That is right. We have not been asked to do as much as we were for the earthquake or the flood for that matter. More people have died in the Northeast-- That is right. It is a 100-year cold in a lot of these places. We have, first of all, tried to cut down on the Federal Government's power usage. We shut it down yesterday, shut it down today, and we are going to open late tomorrow and try to keep our power usage down so that we can give the power to people in their homes. Secondly, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Cisneros anticipating this, gave out all of our homeless money early, so that all the State and local governments all around here have got as much money as we can possibly give them to take care of homelessness and to try-- Anticipating a tough winter? Yes, just try-on the event that it happened, we just wanted to get everybody off the streets as much as we can. And we are going to be looking for whatever else we can do now. There may be some other problems in the next couple of days. We are praying and hoping it will get warmer. Nature humbles all of us. Humble you, too? Absolutely. I was looking at that interstate cracked open and those houses ruined in Los Angeles yesterday, and I just remind you that we are not in full control-- A ENTITY brings hope to that, does not he? I think so. And there is a symbolic-- Oh, absolutely. Yesterday I could see-thousands of people came out to see me yesterday, to see the ENTITY, not Bill Clinton, And I could see their energy, their hope. And I have two jobs: One is to rally them by doing my job, and the other is doing my job. James Lee Witt, who runs the emergency management of this country is doing a wonderful job, and we work at that hard. And we owe that to those people. More things current, Special Counsel Robert Fiske appointed today by Janet Reno, was that solely her appointment? Oh, absolutely. I did not know anything about it. Do you know Mr. Fiske? No. Going to cooperate fully? Absolutely. Whatever they want to do, we will be glad to do it. He says he is going to probably take testimony from you and Hillary. Whatever he wants to do. The main thing I want to do is just have that turned over to him so we can go back to work. I just want to do my job. I do not want to be distracted by this anymore. I did not do anything wrong. Nobody's ever even suggested that I did. Everybody who is talked about it has suggested, as a matter of fact, to the contrary, that I did not . But still, let them look into it. I just want to go back to work. Was it unfair, the press, or was it fair? Was it a story? Is it a story? Well, let us wait until it is all over, and then maybe I will have something to say then. The main thing is, it is important that I not be distracted from the job of being ENTITY. That is what I owe the American people. I have got to get up every day, no matter what else is going on, and try to give everything I have to moving this country forward to changing this country for the better. And this will take the onus, if you will, off of that. People will know it is being handled in that way, and then I can just go back to work, which is what I want to happen. In all candidness, a Special Counsel should have been appointed sooner, do you think? Well-- I mean, it would have certainly taken the story down. It would have. I was concerned in the beginning about agreeing to it when- for the first time ever, no one ever-people were saying, We know you did not do anything wrong, so appoint a Special Counsel. It was not , There is this evidence of wrongdoing. Were you involved in it? or something like that. But it was a much bigger story here and then eventually around the country, I think, than I had anticipated. So the important thing for me, again, was for people to feel comfortable about the way it is handled so I can go back to work. And I think now people will feel comfortable about the way it is handled, and I can go to work. The one thing most people are asking is-they will learn more about this, because it is involved, obviously-is why you took a loss and did not take a deduction since everybody who has a loss takes a deduction. Well, that will come out in the-I think we took some interest deductions along, which were part of our losses, but at the end I did basically what we thought was the bend-over-backwards right thing to do and what was appropriate at the time. But let us wait until the investigation is over. That'll all come out, and then if there are questions about it, when the report's made to the American people, I can answer questions about it then. The night of the NAFTA debate and the passage of NAFTA, were you at all surprised at how well Al Gore did? Oh, no. Because he had, you know, this wooden image and-- Yes, but I knew-- --people were predicting that Perot would beat him-- I thought he would be great here if he had a fair chance and an honest debate. You know, he is like all the rest of us, sometimes we pick up images that are on occasion right but not fully accurate. And this image of him as sort of wooden and stiff, anybody who really knows him will tell you he is very funny, he has a terrific sense of humor, he is got an incredibly flexible mind. And the reason I like this debate format that you provided is that no one could shout anyone else down. I mean, they were all sitting here real close, you know. You were sitting here. Everybody got to talk. Everybody got to answer questions. And I knew two things: I knew he knew a lot about it; I knew he believed very deeply in the position that we had taken. It was not just something he was saying- Well, I am the Vice ENTITY, and Bill Clinton is for NAFTA, and I have got to be -he believed it deep down in his bones. And I knew that he would feel comfortable and confident. So I liked it. You know, he and I were-we might have been in the minority in our administration when this whole thing was first To do that was his idea, and he asked you to okay-- He said, What do you think about it? And I immediately said, I think it is a terrific idea. And so we were sort of like salesmen in our own house. But the handlers said no. Well, no, some of them did, not all of them but some of them. But we were beginning to make progress, you know; we were beginning to pick up votes already. But we were doing it by basically saying to Members of Congress, You know this is right, and you know it is in the national interest, and you ought to do it even if it is unpopular in the short run. We felt, he and I both did, that this debate here, this discussion on your program, would be the only chance we'd ever have to kind of break through to ordinary Americans who watch you and listen to you and just want to know. And that is really what-that is what you did. You gave us a chance to talk to everyday Americans. And he was really-and I was so proud of him. I mean, he was really wonderful. Do you think we might see someday a ENTITY debate? Well, it could be. Certainly if I run for reelection I will expect-- No, I do not mean that. I mean major issues coming up for a vote-health care-- It could be. --you and Senator Dole, or someone, someone of the leadership, where a ENTITY would sit down and say, Let us discuss it with the opposition. I do not think that is ever happened in this country. It might not-I would not be afraid of doing it. I would not want to commit in advance just because I would want to make sure it was the right thing to do at the time. But you know, I run a remarkably open Presidency. I ran for this job because I wanted to get the economy going, I wanted to get the country back together again, and I wanted people to believe that their Government belonged to them again and that we could be more open and accessible to them. And I have tried to do that. The day after I was inaugurated, we opened the White House to just folks to come in. And tonight in another way we are opening the White House again. And we are going to do that right away. When we come back you can call in and talk to the ENTITY of the United States on this special edition of Live. Do not go away. Welcome back to Live. By the way, the ENTITY was fully prepared to go 90 minutes tonight, but he is very tired. As you might imagine, this has been a back-breaking schedule with the death of his mother, the funeral, overseas, back home, full physical, and we mean full physical, right?-you had what they call top-to-toe-and then out to L.A. So we understand fully, and we will get to as many calls as we can. How was the physical, okay? Great. Okay, Chevy Chase, Maryland, with ENTITY. Hello. Yes, ENTITY, what do you say to those who say that you and your administration have not done a good job about Somalia? And given the fact that the Somalis do not trust the UNISOM, Somalia is bound to go back to where it was before the U.S. intervention. Thank you. Well, I think we have done a good job in Somalia. We have saved a lot of lives there. But when we went there, it was primarily for a humanitarian purpose, to try to save the lives. I was told when I became ENTITY that we might be able to withdraw the American troops as early as one month, 2 months into my term. We have now been a full year, and as you know, we have got a few more months to go before we withdraw our troops. But the thing that caused the starvation in Somalia in the beginning was that a lot of people identified with their clans more than the country as a whole, and they were fighting each other. What we have done is to set in motion a process in which the clans can agree to a peaceable way of governing the country among themselves. And if they do not do that, we'd have to stay forever. And we cannot do that. So in the end, the people of Somalia are going to have to take responsibility for themselves and their future. And in the meanwhile, we will keep working to try to keep as many of them alive as we can. To Plantation, Florida, with ENTITY. Hello. Good evening, ENTITY. How would you like to lower the country's trade deficit and balance the payments by giving all Americans and all businesses tax deductions for buying American products, by definition 90 percent made in America with 90 percent parts made in America and 90 percent profits going to American companies? Would that work? I wonder whether it would even be-- Legal? Yes. It would certainly, I think, violate some of our international trade agreements, and it might cause others to retaliate against us. I would like to lower our trade deficit, at least that which is structural and permanent. Our biggest problems are with Japan and now with China. Are you going over there? Yes, we are working on both of them. I understand what he is saying, and we do have certain buy America preferences in our law, but we have to be very careful how far we go without violating the treaties and agreements we made with other countries who take our products freely. By the way, something just hit me, and it occurred in the last year. The last time we were here was the night Vince Foster died. It was 6 months-- Six months ago, tonight. Six months ago, tonight. Do we know a lot more than we did before? I do not think we know any more than we did in the beginning because I just really do not believe there is any more to know. You know, he left a note; he was profoundly depressed. You did not know it? No. And I talked to him-- The night before, right? No, I think 2 nights before, and told him to come see me. Or maybe it was the night before, and I told him to come see me on Wednesday, which was the day after he shot himself. It broke my heart. We'd been friends for more than 40 years. We lived next to each other when we were little bitty kids. He was a remarkable man. And I miss him. This Special Counsel says he is going to look into that, too. Is that fair game? Well, I think because he had some files that were relevant to-I think he has to look into what was there, and he will just- whatever he wants to do, you know, let him do that. That is not my business to comment on. Detroit, Michigan, for ENTITY. Hello. Hello, ENTITY. Congratulations on your one year in office, and many more. Thank you. I live in Detroit where we have had 629 murders in our State, and I would like to know, what can you do or help us about this issue? And I would just like to congratulate you. You have been a ENTITY that has said what you are going to do, and you have done it. And regardless of what the media bashing, I thank you for all that you have done. Thank you, ma'am. First of all, let me say that you call from Detroit, which has had a lot of murders. And the Children's Defense Fund said today that a child is killed with a gun every other hour in this country now. Unbelievable. Unbelievable, but it is true. But this lady could have called from many other cities in the country and small towns, too. Let me tell you what I think we can do together. First of all, we have got to strengthen our law enforcement forces. You have got a great new mayor in Detroit in Dennis Archer. He is a longtime friend of mine. I read his inaugural address the other day. It was a brilliant way of getting Detroit together and getting started. But we have to put more police officers on the street, well-trained and working with people in the communities, walking the blocks, working with the kids, preventing crime as well as catching criminals. Our crime bill will put 100,000 more police officers on the street. It is the first priority for Congress when they come back. Secondly, we passed the Brady bill, but we need to do more on guns. Specifically, we need to limit these automatic, semiautomatic assault weapons that have no purpose other than to kill. And I hope we can reach an accord with the sportsmen and quit arguing about things that are false issues and get an agreement on what the problem is and how to attack it. Thirdly, people who are repeated serious violent offenders should not be paroled. And fourthly, you have got to give these kids something to say yes to. That is, we have got to go into these really distressed areas and rebuild the bonds of family, community, and work. There is got to be education opportunities. There is got to be job opportunities. There is got to be alternatives to imprisonment, like boot camps. There needs to be drug treatment and drug education programs. We cannot have it all on the punishment. These children have to have something to say yes to. If you look at a lot of these high crime areas where the gangs and the drugs and the guns are, they fill the vacuum when family collapses, when work collapses. Most of us organize our lives around work, family, community. And a lot of these young people that are in real trouble today and really vulnerable are living in places where there is not enough community, enough family, or enough work. So I think we have to do both things. And then next year or this year now, I am going to ask the Congress to work with me and then work with the mayors, the Governors, and others to really get serious about this. We have got to do something about it, and we have got a program that will make a difference. To Auckland, New Zealand, with ENTITY. Hello. Greetings from New Zealand, ENTITY. How are you, sir? I am good; how are you? In your Geneva meeting with ENTITY Asad of Syria, did you ask him for a withdrawal of the Syrian forces from Lebanon, or a least at time schedule, or Lebanon's going to be the price for peace with Israel? Thank you. No, no. Lebanon was not the price for peace. He agreed that as part of a comprehensive peace agreement, we should implement the Taif accord which, as you know, calls for an independent Lebanon, free of all foreign forces. And ENTITY Asad clearly said that if he could be satisfied from his point of view in having a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel, Israel would also have to have an agreement with Lebanon, an agreement with Jordan, and obviously the agreement with the PLO, and that Lebanon in the end would be left a free and independent state, independent of all foreign forces. We talked about that quite explicitly, and he was quite clear in saying that he would support that. Was it tough to sit with Asad, who has been on a list of-as a terror leader for years? I mean, I know Presidents have to do things-was that hard? Well, it was not an easy meeting. I mean, I knew it would be a challenging and a difficult meeting. And I think the most important thing for me was to make it clear that I-my overriding agenda was to do whatever I could to make an honorable, decent, lasting peace in the Middle East. Do you think he was sincere? Yes, I think he really wants to make peace. I think there are a lot of reasons why it is in the interests of the Syrian people and in his own interest to do it, and I think he does. I also made it clear that we still had real differences between us in our bilateral relations, and one of them was what we feel about terrorism. And we talked about it for an hour. And he gave his side, and I gave mine. But the American people are entitled to know that. We talked about it for an hour-- Did he deny that he-- We did not skirt it. He did in a way, and he defined it in a different way, and he made some arguments about what Syria has done and not done. But the point is, we got it out on the table. He said what he thought; I said what I thought. And maybe most important, we agreed that our Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, and their Foreign Minister, Mr. Shara, would meet and really try to get beyond the charges to very specific things, that we would come forward with specific instances of things that we believe have been done that are a violation of international law that cannot be tolerated, and we would try to work through them. So I think that it was an honorable meeting from my point of view and from the point of view of the United States because of that. New York City for ENTITY. Hello. A lot of companies are hiring people on a part-time or temporary basis because they do not want to give them benefits. Under your health care plan, how will people who work part-time or freelance have their benefits paid for? That is a great question. Let me answer the question and make a general point. First of all, under our health care plan, part-time workers will be covered partly by their employers if they work more than 10 hours a week. They will pay a portion of their premiums. And then the rest of the premium will be paid for out of a Government fund set up for that purpose. But part-time workers will be covered, and their employers will have to pay something for their coverage, too. I think that is only fair. Also, if we can do something to slow the dramatic increase in the cost of health care and to make sure all workers are covered, that, I think, will help to stabilize this trend, and more and more employers will be willing to hire new workers on a full-time basis. And let me say, we are beginning to see that now. Since I became ENTITY and we got serious about bringing the deficit down, bringing interest rates down, getting investment up, and employment started coming again, as confidence gets back into this economy, then employers will be able to hire more full-time workers. Then this year, what I have to be able to do is to show the business community that this health care plan of ours is going to stabilize health care costs while providing health care for all Americans through a guaranteed private insurance system, not a Government system but a private system. But we have to ask the employers to pay something for their part-time workers, too. I think that is only fair. Back with more of this conversation with the ENTITY on his one-year in office on Live. He said he'd be with us every 6 months-holding right to it-he was with us July 20th, this is January 20th. We will be right back. We are back with the ENTITY. More phone calls-Hawaii. Hello. Yes, aloha, ENTITY, and ENTITY. Aloha. This is the big island. ENTITY, in regards to sympathy for your mother, I had the opportunity to see your mother catch a fish when she was over here, and she is quite a fisherwoman. A great, great lady. I am sorry to hear about that. She loved that tournament. In regards to Korea, what is the possibility of the Koreans getting a nuclear weapon and maybe possibly striking Hawaii first since that is part of the United States now? What would the-- Yes, what is the current status of North Korea? Well, first let me say, thank you to the gentleman from Hawaii for the condolences for my mother, and mine to the mother of the Governor of Hawaii who passed away today. A wonderful woman. The Korean-let me just tell you, if you follow the press you know that the intelligence reports are divided on the question of how far the North Koreans have gone in developing a nuclear weapon. But everybody knows they are trying to. Even if they develop one, then there is the question of their delivery capacity, which is in doubt. I would not say Hawaii is in serious danger right now. What I would say is that we need to keep working very hard and to be very firm about not wanting Korea to join the family of nuclear states. You know, I have been out here working to reduce the number of countries with nuclear weapons, with Ukraine and Kazakhstan and Belarus committing to get rid of their weapons. We are now involved in intense negotiations, and the only thing I can tell you is we are working as hard as we can to be as firm as we can and then to be as also as firm as we can about the security of our people and the South Koreans in the event all does not go well. But we are working very hard, and I certainly have not given up yet on getting the North Koreans to go back into the NPT system and agreeing to let the International Atomic Energy inspectors in there to look at what they are doing. They ought to do it. The country is so isolated. They are isolated economically. Even China used to be a big ally of theirs. China now does 8 or 10 times as much trade with South Korea as with North Korea. And I think they believe that somehow this gives them some handle on national prestige. I think their best way to be esteemed in the rest of the world is to be a good citizen and give the rest of us a chance to relate to them. Birmingham, Alabama. Hello. ENTITY, I find your political opponents' relentless efforts to undermine the credibility of your administration absolutely appalling. How much does this cost the American citizen in terms of wasted time and money? And does it affect the U.S. in the international community? Well, first I thank you for your sentiments and your support. And the most important thing of all is that the American people be able to see through it. When they see the politics of personal destruction, when they see people who obviously do not want to talk about how we are going to get this economy going or how we are going to get health care to all Americans or how we are going to deal with the other problems, crime in the streets, that they see it for what it is. I think that abroad, frankly, our administration and me, that I personally, that we are able to do what we need to do for the United States. I was very gratified at the reception that I received in Europe and in Russia and throughout our travels. It does take time and attention and distraction when you are dealing with all that stuff, but as I said to ENTITY earlier, I can deal with it. The only thing that really steams me is what it does to my wife and my daughter, to my family. As a person, that bothers me. But it is not undermining our ability to go forward. Does it take time and attention, is it distracting, is it costly in that sense? You bet it is. It apparently is a part of the price of being in public life in the late 20th century in the United States. So we deal with it. But I just want you to know that having you call just redoubles my determination. And I thank you for that. Fort Worth, Texas. Hello. ENTITY, I was wondering what the progress on our situation with Bosnia-Herzegovina was? And what has happened to the sense of urgency we once had with that problem? Well, the United States had a position, as you know. When I took office I offered the Europeans my position, what I thought we ought to do, how I thought we ought to do it to get a quicker peace and, if not get peace, at least to give the government of that country a chance to defend itself. The Europeans disagreed and stoutly resisted. I did not believe that we could unilaterally or should unilaterally send ground troops there. I still think that was the right decision. So let me tell you where it is now. First of all, do not forget what we have done. We have led the longest airlift in history, now longer than the Berlin airlift, to give food and medicine to the people there. Secondly, we have enforced a ferocious embargo which has cost the Serbs, in particular, dearly. It has virtually wrecked the Serbian economy. They continue to fight, but they have paid a terrible price for it economically. And thirdly, we have tried to work with our allies at NATO to say that we would use air power if Sarajevo were subject to shelling and strangulation again. And finally, we are supporting the peace process. I hope the parties will agree. You see, the Serbs and the Croats have agreed now. The government had been losing on the ground. They'd been making some gains so they have not agreed to any peace-or they are going to have to give, I think, to Moslems, some access to the water in order to get a peace agreement. They are a little closer than I think it looks, but eventually they are going to have to agree to that or the fighting will go on. Are you optimistic? Oh, I have learned not to be optimistic there. I was optimistic a time or two and had my hopes dashed. --got to take a break. But the people are still killing each other because they are fighting over land. They are going to have to reach a territorial accommodation so that all three of those ethnic groups can live with a reasonable breathing room there. We will be back with our remaining moments with ENTITY right after this. We are running out of time. Biggest hope as we enter the second year of the Presidency? That we can get health care for all Americans. Biggest fear? That democracy will face reversal somewhere in the world and dash my hopes of having a more peaceful world that has more trade opportunities and less military dangers for the United States. Are you happy? Oh, yes, and grateful for the chance to serve and grateful that we are making progress. I know a lot of Americans are still in trouble, and their lives have not been affected yet, but at least we are facing these tough issues that have been ignored for too long. And everybody here gets up and goes to work every day and works like crazy and I think in a spirit of genuine hopefulness. Some said that you even like the bad days. I mean, you like this job, right? I like the job. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve. The bad days are part of it. I did not run to have a pleasant time. I ran to have a chance to change the country. And if the bad days come with it, that is part of life. And it is humbling and educational. It keeps you in your place. Thank you, ENTITY. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlarryking1", "title": "Interview With Larry King", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-larry-king-1", "publication_date": "20-01-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Bill Clinton"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 278, "text": "I am going to give you an opening statement. But first of all, these observers are simply that. They are not going to take one question. They get no questions. They are here just to listen to your questions and my answers. They probably will like your questions and not like my answers. Anyway, let me talk about the trip from my perspective, and we will kind of rotate around. Everybody will get at least one question; hopefully everybody will get two. First, I am looking forward to my trip. Obviously, one of the main purposes of the trip is to go speak about development, world development, in Monterrey. I will lay out there for the world leaders what- I already did so in our country-which is the Millennium Challenge Fund, of a fund that will ultimately be $5 billion a year. It starts at $1.5 billion, roughly $1.5 billion, and then will go up to about two-thirds of $5 billion, and then will be at $5 billion in year three and will remain at $5 billion. And that fund will be used to encourage-first of all, it will say our country assumes our rightful responsibility to help developing nations, but we expect there to be rightful obligations on those who receive them to make sure that there is an education system that works, a health care system that works, an opportunity for development of an entrepreneurial class or small businesses, foster trade between ourselves. And countries that practice good habits will get money. Now, this is on top of roughly $10 billion which we spend already in direct development aid, not including other projects, assistance to the World Bank organizations, et cetera. Also, I am really looking forward to seeing my friend the President of Mexico. He was my friend prior to September the 11th; he was my friend after September the 11th; he will be my friend for a long period of time because I know him well. I respect him a lot. We have got a very good relationship, and obviously, we have got a very important bilateral relationship. So we are going to have a-we will have a discussion about issues that are common issues. Obviously, the border is a common issue, how to make the border work better, looking at a variety of options as to how to modernize the border between Mexico and the United States, as well as the border between Canada and the United States. I will discuss some ideas with him. We will continue to talk about migration, the need to make sure that people are treated with respect when they come to this country; that I strongly believe that we need to pass what we call 245 here. The House has done so; the Senate has not done anything yet. And I'd like to get that done quickly. We are urging the Senate to move and to get this bill passed. And we have got a lot of discussions about commercial relations and law enforcement relations. We have got great cooperation. I have been very impressed by the dialog that we have had. It was a good dialog before the attacks; it is been a good dialog after. Then we go down to Peru. I am looking forward to seeing President Toledo. He is a leader dedicated to democracy and reform. I am really looking forward to being in Lima. I have never been there. It is going to be an exciting trip for me and mi esposa. And it will not only give me a chance to have a good bilateral discussion with el Presidente on a variety of subjects, not the least of which will be counternarcotics cooperation, trade. I am very concerned about opening markets in the United States. We will talk to him about that. And then we will be meeting with other leaders from the Andean trade pact. And I look forward to meeting them as well. I have known most of them before. This will be the third or fourth time I have seen President Toledo, so I have got a familiar relationship with him. And then off to El Salvador to discuss a free trade agreement with the Central American countries and to see my friend President Flores, who is really one of the bright young leaders. I admire him a lot and respect him a lot. So I look forward to discussing-the main discussion in Central America will be trade, will be the focus on how to enhance prosperity. The main discussions with the Andean countries will be trade plus, obviously, the issue of drugs, drogas. I will remind all countries, however, that our Nation has got to do a better job of suppressing demand. In order to make sure that we are effective in dealing with the Andean nations, with the issue of borders, safe borders with Mexico-so long as we have got people using drugs in America, somebody is going to provide them. And it is likely they are going to come from our neighbors. So we have got a big obligation at home as well. I want to make that clear to the leaders and the people as well. So this is going to be an exciting trip. I said when I first got elected that good relations in the neighborhood, in our own neighborhood, is the cornerstone of a good foreign policy. I meant that. My first trip as President was to Mexico. I continue to stay very much involved in the neighborhood, and so I am looking forward to the trip. Yes, ENTITY. In your trip to Mexico City, you are talking about-- Mexico City, do you mean Monterrey? I am sorry, Monterrey. I was going to say, have we got another trip, and they forgot to tell me? When you are talking about trade, you obviously know that the whole issue of fast track has not gone anywhere here in the Senate. Do you see that-- In the Senate? Yes. And in Congress, itself. Well, the House passed it, remember? Right. We got it out of the House, which a lot of people did not think we were going to be able to do. So as far as trade conversations down there, do you see that as a problem? No, I do not . I see it- I will remind them that we will continue to work hard with the Senate. I will remind them of some of the language of some of the Senators that do believe that we ought to have a free trade agreement. We ought to extend the Andean Trade Preference Act, which I will continue to push and will not happen prior to my leaving. I am going in 2 days. But nevertheless, we are confident we can get that done. I will also remind them trade promotion authority passed the House. A lot of people thought that was a higher hurdle than the Senate. The Senate leadership has said that they are going to bring this bill up. I do not know the timing of it yet, but we are going to push hard to get it done as soon as possible. It is an important issue to a lot of Senators, and I think I will get it done. So I will talk about that. Obviously, we have an obligation at home to get TPA passed, and we are halfway there. And then we will also talk about free trade in the Americas, as well as the Central American-the trade negotiations. I will be talking about Chile, starting with the free trade agreement with Chile. We think we can get that done this year as well. So there is a lot of positive progress. And I will remind them that on the decision I made on steel, I honored the agreements and the commitments of NAFTA and the free trade agreement. And so, as a result, Canada and Mexico were excluded from the agreement, as are most developing nations. And the only nation that is been affected is Brazil in our hemisphere, and only to the extent of about 12 percent of her steel production-or her exports. ENTITY, in Lima, you are going to meet with President Pastrana of Colombia. Yes, I am. While your administration is moving to increase the aid, the military aid to Colombia, to fight the foreign guerrillas-but according to the U.S. State Department, most of the drug trafficking-no, much of the drug trafficking problem and human rights violation is responsibility for the rightwing paramilitary group AUC. Are not you afraid that your effort could not help to solve a big part of the problem? Am I afraid-I beg your pardon-afraid of the? That you help the Colombian Government to fight the FARC-- Well, we expect them to fight all renegade and terrorist groups. We expect them to hold the line. I mean, we are not picking and choosing. We believe that AUC and FARC need to be-we need to focus on AUC and FARC, and the third group-I understand Mr. Pastrana is in discussions with them right now, and we will see how that goes. And so we do not play favorites with terrorist groups and renegade groups. We believe there is equality, and they are equally bad. And so we are going to insist that we- not insist-we will offer help and aid, like we have done. Right now we are restricted by Congress to focus on narcotrafficking, and we believe that we will work-we need to work with Congress to help broaden the focus to counterterrorism. And we are more than willing to have those discussions with Congress. I have already done so. But I have always said that we will stay within the confines of the law. We have no interest in committing ground troops, but we do want to help them, and we will do so. ENTITY, about this trade agreement with Central American countries- and I am thinking specifically of El Salvador. How is your vision-how do you make these free trade agreements into benefits for the real people? I mean, in terms of development, what is your vision? Well, I think people-first of all, the statistic I like to quote is that we buy $450 billion of goods from developing nations on an annual basis. I think that is the number I used the other day in my speech. That is 8 times more-and that, by the way, ends up-when you purchase goods, you are actually purchasing something that requires labor, and labor is a job. And so one of the focuses of this administration is how to put policies in place that enable people to work for a living. What is it-what is it we can do with each other? And trade equals jobs, as far as I am concerned. And the trade figures, which really put money directly into the economies of countries with whom we trade, are significantly bigger than direct aid. And so it makes sense to promote trade. So the answer to your question-and I am confident people in your fine country are asking, What good is it for me? How will this benefit me? And that is a legitimate question people ask. And the answer is, trade equals jobs. The more markets are open, the more trade there is, the more jobs available. And the President understands; President Flores understands that. And that is very important to understand. It is-the amount of capital that ends up flowing within the private sector in the country is significantly greater than any aid package could possibly be. And that is important for people to know. And that is why I think President Flores is excited about the idea of having this trade pact. And obviously, countries are going to have to put procedures in place that will allow for the orderly development of a private sector, rule of law, anticorruption measures. No one is going to do business if you get money stolen from you. There is got to be tightening of anticorruption measures. There is got to be a good education system. And part of the Millennium Challenge Fund will help developing nations develop an education system. One of the things we learned from northern Mexico-the trade-is that trade created a lot of job opportunity. And the job opportunity created training opportunities, which in itself was good education for many people. The border region of my State, while still poor, has changed significantly as a result of the trade policies. And Monterrey has blossomed into one of the great financial centers of the hemisphere because of trade. And so there is a lot of positive benefits for people. People talk about health care, and it is essential that we have good health care. But it is -a society that is generating wealth is one much more likely to provide good health care for her people. And there is a lot of benefits to trade. And so that is probably the most direct benefit to the people. Drug Interdiction/Intelligence One small detail concerning what he asked you before. Is Peru, Colombia, and the United States talking about a place in an intelligence basement in the jungle of Colombia and Peru to fight narcotraffickers and-- Are we talking about- I cannot get too specific about placements. Let me just put it to you this way: We are willing to cooperate to do as effective a job as we can on interdicting. I will not count that as a question. You are already talking about it. And my question, please-- One of the things we do not discuss, at least in this administration, is intelligence matters. We do not want the enemy to have any sense about what we are thinking about doing, or where we may be going. So that does not count as a question. President Toledo will ask you to help him for the reclassification of documents concerning corruption and human rights violations in Fujimori's government. The CIA, especially-- FBI. FBI and CIA also has some of the most important documents, we think, concerning the Vladimiro Montesinos. How long are we going to have to wait to know what those documents have? Well, actually, we are cooperating very closely. I think he would say that we have had great cooperation with the Peruvian Government. There has been significant cooperation. As a matter of fact, it led to the significant arrest, as you may remember. And I will be very candid with him and talk about matters of sharing information. We are not-again, I do not know a specific document you are talking to. But I can tell you the history has been positive up to now. Otherwise the arrest-I cannot remember the fellow's name. You know him more than me, Fujimori's close-- Vladimiro Montesinos? Yes. That was the result of our cooperation, if I am not mistaken. How was it? What? How was it? How was the result? Yes. Well, we shared a lot of information in order to make the case, if I am not mistaken. The Ambassador here was very much involved with that. And I think that history will show when the facts come out that this man would not have been arrested without the close cooperation of the U.S. Government. Sir, the Washington Post runs a story today that-about the creation of a new border agency that will merge Customs, the INS, and the Border Patrol. Do not believe everything you read in the paper. Okay. That is off the record, of course. No, put it in there. It will make me a hero. I know that the-at least the border issue will be a main topic on Friday's bilateral reunion with President Fox. What will a reinforced U.S.-Mexican border mean for each country? Yes, let me talk about- first of all, I am exploring all options to make our borders more secure and more modern. And so what does that mean with Mexico? Well, first of all, I recognize the-of all people, I recognize, since I was the Governor of Texas, I know how much traffic goes across that border on a daily basis and how much of that traffic stays within the region. I mean, we have got aunts and uncles visiting their nephews and nieces and have been doing it for generations. And therefore, a smart border policy is one that recognizes customs and habits and the history; as a matter of fact, facilitates that flow, as opposed to prevents that flow of people; and recognizes that there is a unique relationship here and, therefore, there is got to be positive policies that do not impede those customs. Secondly, a smart border is one that recognizes that we have got traffic originating in the midst of our respective countries that can be inspected somewhere other than the border-get a good seal of approval from an inland port, say, and let that cargo, once it is inspected, once clear for travel, proceed directly to a port or a destination in Mexico or the United States or vice versa, so that the traffic moves more expeditiously through the border. It is a smart border initiative. It is one that recognizes the amount of commerce. You go down to Laredo, like I have, and you have got miles and miles of trucks. The system is antiquated; it is outdated. It needs to be modernized for the good of both countries. Third, border security means more manpower and effective coordination to crack down on coyotes. The worst kind of smuggling, in my judgment, is people smuggling. And as you well know, there has been a lot of that, and there is been a lot of tragedy as a result of poor, hard-working Mexicans, looking for a job, ending up in the back of somebody's truck in terrible weather, in horrible conditions, because of coyotes. And we have got to do a better job. And when we crack down on the coyotes, we have also been pretty darn effective at the same time about cracking down on smuggling, on both ways, I might add. We need to be effective with biometrics. That will not only facilitate the common flow, the daily flow of traffic; it will also help us deal with those who are coming into the country illegally and/or register those who are coming illegally for extended periods of time. So there is a lot we can do. How best to effect that is what I am looking at within the administration. I am looking at a variety of options, because I want our borders to be modern and secure and recognize the great vitality between our respective countries. We have had good dialog, by the way, with the Fox administration, as have we had with the Chretien administration. And I think people are beginning to realize that we are serious about-both sides, or all three of us, are serious about working collaterally to make our borders work better. As far as the 245, how confident are you that the Senate will move on it? Well, I am not confident they will move on it; I am confident we have got the votes. But the problem is, I have not been confident that they are going to move on many things these days. We have gotten a lot of bills out of the House and not much out of the Senate. And so that is why-I just finished my Cabinet meeting and made a direct call to the Senate to get 245 passed. They are dealing with other matters. Campaign funding reform is up, and they have still got an energy bill moving around. Because there is also a deadline for the program to end. No, I know. Trust me, I am a big 245 backer. And I remember, as I recall, some in the Senate and the House went down to Mexico and talked to President Fox about a modern immigration policy. And I just hope that they are able to live up to their-kind of their implied promise or explicit promise they told the Mexican people when they went down there. ENTITY, in your trip to Lima, you are going to meet the Andean Presidents but not the Venezuelan President. That is right. As your spokesman tells us almost every day-- He mentioned it? Yes. Your administration are-your administration is not happy with Mr. Chavez's trips, Mr. Chavez's friends. What should the current Venezuelan administration do to-in order to be closer to your- maybe get a meeting? Or thinking about the recent political unrest in Venezuela, are you worried that there could be some- the situation could be worse? Well, let me see here. First, Venezuela is not a part of the Andean trade group. Secondly, the President has spoken out against free trade agreements. And since this is going to be mainly a discussion-other than my bilateral with President Toledo-a discussion about trade, that it does not seem to make sense to have him a part of those discussions. Why have somebody there who is not in favor of what we are all trying to do? Secondly, we are concerned about Venezuela. We have had longtime connections with the Venezuelan people, have a great respect for the Venezuelan people. We have got a commercial relationship with the Venezuelans for years, and that obviously is in the energy sector. And we are concerned anytime there is unrest in our neighborhood, and we are watching the situation very carefully. This man was elected by the people. We respect democracy in our country, and we hope that he respects those institutions, the democratic institutions within his country. ENTITY, as you might or might not be aware, there are 6 million Salvadorans living inside our country. Yes. And 2 million and a half living outside, mostly in the United States. What could we expect in terms of migrations? Are you-also the announcement of the TPS extension for Salvadorans? I will not be making that announcement there. But as you may remember, I supported the TPS extension last time around. It does not come up until September of this year, if I am not mistaken. I will take it under advisement. But the last time it came up, I was strongly in support. Let me just give you my view generally about immigration. There are people in our neighborhood who hurt-a mom or a dad who worry about whether or not their children eat-and I have great sympathy for those folks. And many come to our country to work. I used to remind people that family values did not stop at the Rio Bravo. There is a lot of parents who deeply care about whether or not their families can survive and are willing to take a risk to come long distances to find work. And it turns out that a place that had been looking for workers for a period of time was the United States. The economy was strong. There were a lot of jobs that others would not do, what people were willing to do, and they came here. And my attitude is that we ought to have a program, figure out a program that will match a willing employer with a willing employee and make that a part of a legal process. In other words, if you are willing to work and somebody is looking for a job, that we make that easier rather than harder to accomplish. And that is not the case in the law today. It is hard to legally hire somebody. And I think we can-that is going to be a discussion I must have with Members of our United States Congress and obviously with the President of Mexico, for starters. This is going to take a while to accomplish, but it is -to me, it is a commonsense way to approach the migration issue. How that affects the people here from El Salvador, some legal and some illegal, it is hard to tell. So just to be sure, so you are not making any announcement in terms of migration in El Salvador? No, I am not. But I will remind people, if asked, of course, that I was for TPS the last time around. Peru/Hemispheric Democracy Not only Venezuela but also Argentina and Colombia and Brazil is doing its own way, but South America is going through a very special moment now. Are you looking in Peru a new ally closer to the United States to go to the South American region? Well, that is very interesting. First of all, I am going to Peru because I do view Peru as an ally and a friend. I am the first ENTITY to have ever gone to Peru. And I welcome the reforms in Peru, and I welcome the fact that President Toledo is taking a very firm stand on reforming and anticorruption. And he was elected through the democratic process, which is important. And interestingly enough, all but one nation in our hemisphere has got a democratically elected President. Cuba is the only country that does not have a democratically elected President. That is a significant change, if you think about it, in the history of our hemisphere, an amazing change to the better. We just had elections in Central America, the neighbors of El Salvador. And the neighborhood there has had two elections, good, clean elections, where reformers and advocates for the open market and trade were elected. And I am looking forward- I have met them prior to their swearing-in. I look forward to seeing them again when I am down there. Brazil, obviously, is fixing to have an election. Colombia is going to have an election soon. It will be very interesting to see how that election plays out. Obviously, the security of the people will be an issue in that election. I think that happens in May, if I am not mistaken. So there is an ongoing-to me, it is a- the system-and Mexico, of course, was one where, you know, the PAN wins, and all of a sudden it shows the maturity of the democratic process. And I think this is incredibly positive results for our hemisphere. Not everything is going to be smooth all the time, but so long as leaders and the people demand democracy, there will be more freedom and more opportunity and more hope than in societies that will be closed and will frighten their neighbors. Argentina is a financial issue. Argentina has got a longstanding democracy. And it is an issue of great concern for us, because we are friends with Argentina and we are partners with Argentina. And we are hoping that Argentina will make the necessary reforms, the tough decisions necessary to earn the confidence of some of these international financial institutions but most particularly the IMF. I know that I have talked to my friend the President of Spain a lot, because the Spanish banks are quite exposed in Argentina. They have got more exposure than any banks in the world, and we are second. So we are interested, but we are more interested in the people, themselves. So we have spent, in our administration, a lot of time focusing on Argentina. So I am concerned about that; on the other hand, I know that there is a way out, and the country itself is going to have to make some tough calls, starting with reforming the relationship between the States and their budgets and the central government. But we will see what happens. I am optimistic about our hemisphere. I think it is been-I think there is some really great years ahead of us. And the reason I am is because I have watched some of these elections very closely, and I think the outcomes have been-they have embraced giving the people an opportunity to express themselves. You mentioned Cuba. Yes. It is said that you are going to ask President Toledo to vote against Cuba in the United Nations Human Rights Committee meetings? Well, I would not say voting against. I am just going to remind the Human Rights Commission to remember that Cuba is an incredibly repressive regime. It is the one nondemocratic government. They put people in prison if they do not agree with you. I mean, that to me is a violation of people's human rights. I mean, there is no rule of law there. It is the rule of one person. He is been there for a long period of time, and unfortunately the people of that country are suffering as a result of him. So it is a vote for liberty and freedom, and that is something Mr. Castro does not believe in. For example, there is not a lot of free press there, to put it in your lap, as we say. Okay. Today's main story in our newspaper in Mexico, as part of the international conference in Monterrey, was the U.S. opposition-well, it was Alan Larson's opposition-- Who? Alan Larson? Alan Larson? Oh, okay. Okay. You do know him, okay. I have got a big administration. He was speaking on the-- Well, I do not know if I know him or not. Depends on what he said. Okay, now I am going to rethink the question first-- The real question is, will he know me after what he said? But anyway, go ahead. What is Al's position, and what is the subject? Well, the story was on the United States opposition to aid quotas. Is it-- To what quotas? Aid, quotas for aid. Aid quotas? Aid, to help developing countries. Oh, yes. Okay, yes. And it is -- He and I are in the same position. Al still has a job. That is good. The conference started yesterday, and is it expected that every developed country decides on its own how and how much to help, if-- Now, here is the thing. You cannot -it is an arbitrary measurement that I frankly do not think reflects the great compassion of the United States. People are able to adopt whatever formula they think is necessary to be generous. But these formulas often times do not measure how much a nation is contributing, like our nation is contributing. And I think a better way to go, and the way we are going to go, is through this Millennium Challenge Fund, where we are laying out a $5-billion-a-year commitment. Now, that starts 3 years from now, so- I just want to make sure everybody understands the funding. I know there is a little confusion about what-a third of it, which is more than $1.5 billion, it is a little less than $1.7 billion-$1.66667 billion-and then two-thirds, and then-- Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. Could be, it is going to be-be determined exactly. Anyway, it'll be up to $5 billion at the end of 3 years. Larson Anyway-no, you are Fleischer. Five billion at the end of 3 years, $5 billion the fourth year, $5 billion the sixth year, okay? This is a better way to go. As I said earlier, that it is an obligation we take seriously, and by the way, this is on top of that which we already do. It does not include monies, for example, to make the world more secure. It is hard to have economic development if you are being terrorized. And one of the obligations that we take seriously is the obligation to rid the world of terror. And we do not mind leading this coalition, and we are spending the most money to do so-which is fine. We are happy to do that. We will defend freedom. My only point is, there is a lot of ways to contribute. We are a big contributor to the World Bank, significant contributor to the IMF. We contribute in a variety of ways-the United Nations, which is a large contributor, and there is a variety. So do other nations-do not get me wrong. I am not saying we are the only ones doing this. I am just saying that the best way for us to proceed, the most comfortable I am, is to make the commitment I have made through this Millennium Challenge Fund- which is a reform to the current process, because on the one hand we are saying we have responsibilities; we will uphold those responsibilities. But there is a responsibility from the country that receives money as well, a responsibility to the people, a responsibility to rout out corruption. I think it makes no sense to give aid, money, to countries that are corrupt. Because you know what happens? The money does not help the people; it helps an elite group of leaders. And that is not fair to the people of this particular country, nor is it fair to the taxpayers in the United States. So I believe it is time to bring a measure of accountability into this process, and I am going to be very strong about it in Monterrey. I do not subscribe to the theory that certain countries cannot reform, and therefore we must give them money anyway. I do not buy that. I believe everybody can have basic rule of law and can respect the citizens who live there. Everybody should be able to focus on educating their children and have good health care policy. And so this millennium fund is going to be focusing not only on enhancing trade and the practices that lead to good trade policy-and again, I will repeat, if a nation is worried about developing, a nation can receive a heck of a lot more help, private capital, aid-not in the normal sense but help-through trade. It happens every time. And so the best practices, it seems like to me, the best way to foster what we all would hope for, which is a healthy, well-educated, prosperous world, is to encourage trade and the habits that lead to trade and the habits that lead to marketplace. And again, I repeat, there is got to be good government practices attributed to that. And I am going to be tough about it. I am not interested in funding corruption, period. And if a country thinks they are going to get aid from the United States and they are stealing money, they are just not going to get it out of this millennium fund-and hopefully not out of any fund. And then we expect nations to develop practices that will help the people directly, like good education. I am the first leader who stood up and said that the World Bank ought to have 50 percent of the money they distribute in the form of grants, not loans-grants to help education and health flourish in developing nations. I think it would be a lot better than, you know, loaning money that in many circumstances cannot be repaid. It is hard to get a rate of return in the financial sense on an education system. But you can get a huge rate of return on the capital of human capital, by a good education system. So I am for grants, not loans, for 50 percent of the money coming out of the World Bank. I think there is a lot of people down there in Monterrey that-you know, I did not hear a lot of thunderous applause on it, but it is the right thing to do. And so I am not afraid of taking a lead. And I am going to lead on this issue, because I feel strongly that for our taxpayers to be comfortable with money being spent, there is got to be something, there is got to be an effort made-a true, honest effort made to improve the plight of the people we are trying to help. And I am optimistic about all this. We have got some terrible problems in the world. I am deeply disturbed about the AIDS crisis. It is a significant, significant issue in Africa, obviously. There is a place where we have put up a half a billion dollars to begin. And when I see a strategy, a focused strategy that will yield results, then we will be willing to work with Congress to put more money in. But I want to see-and we did not mind; we are happy to take the lead in starting to seed the fund. But now, it is time to see whether or not there can be a strategy in place that will actually work. And when we see something working-and we'd like to help-but when we see something working, we will be an enthusiastic backer. But if it does not work, it is time-it is time-to hold people accountable. And that is exactly what my message is going to be in Monterrey. I am looking forward to giving- I am sorry. I have got to go. I will wait and see. Tengo que salir. You'd better yell loud, because I cannot hold this pack back. They will be up there yelling and elbowing and screaming out questions. You watch; they are a very aggressive lot back there. Possible Caribbean Visit ENTITY, do you envision going to the Caribbean soon at all or doing the same kind of thing that you are doing in Central and South America? Quizas, quizas. ENTITY, are you going to see President Duhalde of Argentina, do you know? Is he on your schedule, do you know? I do not know. Oh, you mean in Monterrey? Yes, sir, on this trip. I imagine I will see him. We are having a dinner, leaders' dinner only, if I am not mistaken. Yes. A luncheon. Luncheon.

{"id": 186, "text": "ENTITY, this is Jim Gardner from Philadelphia. Loud and clear. See you, Jim. How are you, sir? On a scale of one to ten? About a seven today. Well, that is not so great. It is pretty good. Well, it is not so bad. No, it is not bad. ENTITY, I am sorry ENTITY, we were interested to hear your spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, this morning proclaim today that the country is, in fact, still in a recession. Until now you have said again and again that the country was technically not in a recession. What changed your mind? Well, I do not know about technically, but I think what we are trying to put the emphasis on is people are hurting. And some people can define it. Some areas will say, Hey, we are not in recession; we have got a certain amount of growth. Others will say, Tell us about it. We are in a serious recession. So, rather than try to define or not define terms, what we are saying is: We are trying to help. And we have got to get this country doing better, to bring pressure on all of us, the administration and Congress, to do what we can to help. And we have done certain things that I think will. We have freed up $9.6 or $9.7 billion worth of Government spending. We are signing a jobs-intensive transportation bill that will kick it. And then, as you know, we are going to have some new initiatives at the State of the Union. So, I am less interested in what the technical definition is. You might argue technically, are we in recession or not? But when there is this kind of sluggishness and concern, definitions, heck with it; let us get on with the business at hand. ENTITY, many thousands of Philadelphians have been suffering at the hands of the economy for far too long, and many of them would feel that they have been abandoned by your administration and specifically by you. I would assume that you do not see it that way. No, I do not . But I can understand their frustration. For a person that is out of work the unemployment rate is not 6.9 percent or 6.8 percent nationally; it is 100 percent. So, I can understand the frustration and, you know, you have got to take the heat in this job. I do not think there is any quick and easy answers to this economy. There are certain things we can do and that I have tried to do in three separate State of the Union Messages. But for somebody that is hurting out there, Jim, I can understand their saying, Hey, the President is not doing enough. Congress is not doing enough. And I have to take the heat on that. I have got to take the responsibility. But what I am trying to do is to lead this country out of this sluggishness to the best of my ability. And, as I say, we have got some proposals, and we are going to have more. The new ABC News/Washington Post poll, out this morning, says that 58 percent of the public think that you care more about serving the wealthy than you do about the middle class. I wonder, does this point to a failure of your economic policy or an inability of the administration to convey how it does feel? I think it is the latter and possibly the former, because people look at it and say, Hey, why cannot you get Congress to do what you want it to do? You did it in Desert Storm. The difference is I did not need Congress to move on Desert Storm, as you may well remember. So I think it is a combination of things. And I can understand when people are hurting that they feel that way, and a good thing happened on this polling, though. I vowed when the polls were sky-high not to live by the polls and saying I did not believe them. And I am not going to start now, trying to analyze where I stand. What we are trying to do is help people and get on with this trying to do what the Federal Government can do to help the recovery. It is not just Federal Government, I might say, but we have got a large role in it, and I want to see us be more effective. The issue about nuclear weapons. Russian President Yeltsin is saying that Ukraine and Byelorussia have agreed to destroy their nuclear weapons. But the Presidents of those two Republics are reportedly saying that they will not get rid of their nuclear weapons or the nuclear weapons on their soil unless Boris Yeltsin gets rid of his. And the President of the Islamic Republic of Kazakhstan is now saying that he wants to keep his nuclear arms. Secretary of State Baker is saying he has no more concern than normal. But are not Americans right to be concerned about nuclear stability in that part of the world? One of the things that we are trying to do in handling this peaceful evolution in the Soviet Union, in the Republics, is to be sure that the nuclear question is handled well. And one of the reasons I spend a fair amount of time on this question is because I think I owe it to the American people to use the best of our ability to see that this nuclear question is handled correctly. I had not heard the latest that you have just given me on one Republic, but I can tell the American people this through you: We are getting proper assurances from all about the safe disposal of and accounting for and control of nuclear weapons. And that is a key. That is one reason why, when I hear this criticism, Hey, you should not spend time on foreign affairs, by some of these turning-inward people we must do it. We owe it to the kids there in the State of Pennsylvania and everyplace else. And I am not going to forswear my responsibilities for leadership in this area. ENTITY, here in Philadelphia, this morning marked the start of a program to make condoms available to juniors and seniors in the city's public schools. How do you feel about that? I am not enthusiastic about that. I certainly would like to see more in the hands of families; more in the hands of education. And I have expressed myself, and you know, let the local jurisdictions do what they want. I mean, they have rights. States have rights. Local communities have rights. Local school boards have rights. But you ask me, I would much prefer to see this matter handled through better education, through behavior, getting people to understand that in the case of AIDS this is a disease that can be controlled, for the most part, by individual behavior. And I do not think passing out condoms is the way you affect individual behavior, very candidly. So I am less enthusiastic about that approach than I am about doing a better job with family, with education, with getting forward with the whole behavioral side of the equation. ENTITY, I appreciate you sharing your thoughts with us today. Nice to be with you. Have a good Christmas.

{"id": 59, "text": "Quick statement-I will be glad to answer questions. I am really looking forward to my trip. It is the first trip to India for me and my wife. We had a great dinner here with the Prime Minister. I found him to be a very decent, honorable person with whom we established warm relations. And he-I just cannot tell you how- what a kind person he was and, at the same time, represented his great country's interests very well. I do want to make something clear in the speech I gave today. I said that-as to the Kashmir interest-issue, America supports a solution that is acceptable to all sides. As you might recall, in my remarks, I said, to both sides. I would like the record to be so that the world hears me say, all sides. I fully understand that the deal has to be acceptable to the Indians, Paks, as well as the citizens of Kashmir. Okay? Yes. ENTITY, how and why has India come front and center to U.S. strategic thinking now after being on the margins for so many years? Well, as you know, there was a history, particularly during the cold war, that made it difficult for our countries to establish a close relationship. However, things change in the world. And as the post-cold war thaw developed, as-attitudes began to shift. Secondly, the Indian economy, as a result of more transparency and openness and trade, began to change. And as the Indian economy changed, it changed the commercial relationship between the United States and India. Thirdly, there are some common threats that make it in our interests to work to-gether-namely terrorism. As I said in my speech today, the United States has been attacked, but India certainly understands what it means to have suffering as a result of terrorist activities. And so there is common interests that have helped to change the relationship. And I intend to seize those interests, as does the Prime Minister, in order to foster what we have called a strategic relationship. And in my speech today, I made it clear to the American people that this relationship is in our interests, and I described the various ways it was in our interests. I think the evolution of the relationship goes to show that the world is-changes, and it is never static. And so thank you for the question. ENTITY, if India's credentials are so good, why is not the U.S. backing its candidacy for the U.N. Security Council? Well, let me make one other point, if you do not mind, that I should have made in my speech today, and that is that there are a lot of Indian Americans who made a tremendous contribution to our country as well. And there are a lot of-over the last-as the high-tech boom helped transform our society, a lot of the brain power behind that boom have been Indian Americans, as well as Indians educated here in America. And so the American people, as well, have begun to get kind of a different perspective on the great contributions that India can not only make to our own country but can make to the world. Our position on the United Nations Security Council has been very clear. First, we support a U.N. Security Council reform, but we think it ought to happen after other institutions within the United Nations become reformed. What I was always worried about is that we would focus on the U.N. Security Council and nothing else would happen. And so we have-we have said to all parties concerned-I fully understand the Indian position just like other nations- that we will take your case under consideration, but first things first. And a classic case of the reform I am talking about is the Human Rights Commission. It needed to be reformed. And what I was, again, worried about is that we'd miss opportunity while focusing on the U.N. Security Council. ENTITY, when do you intend to take the U.S.-India nuclear deal before the Congress and before the Nuclear Supplies Group, which is part of the U.S. obligation? Yes, it is. As we speak, Nick Burns of the State Department is discussing this vital issue with Indian counterparts. We are working through what has been-as I said in the speech, a difficult issue for the Indian Government as well for the American Government. To change the past, the ways of the past, can be difficult at times. I appreciate the Prime Minister's courage last July of laying out a way forward, which I support. And so first things first is to go to India and, hopefully, reach an agreement on separation and then bring that agreement back and start selling it to the Congress. It is -but we cannot bring anything back until we have agreed to the agreement. And that is what is happening now. There is a spirit of good will and cooperation. It is in our country's interest, by the way, to encourage India and aid India in its development of a civilian nuclear power program. The American people are beginning to see high prices of energy, but so are the Indian people. And the reason why is, is that there is growing economies-ours, India's, China's-which is adding to global demand for energy. And demand is outstripping supply, and then what happens, you see price. And one way to help deal with price here at home and/or with India is to develop alternative ways to power homes and businesses as well as automobiles. I was sincere in my speech today when I said that we are dedicated to research and development to come up with alternative ways to use automobiles and want to share that technologies with other nations, particularly a nation like India, which has got huge potential and vast room for growth. And it is in our mutual interests-I also made it clear that it is in our interests that the Indian economy prosper. And it is a very simple reason why. One, a prosperous country is one that is-particularly one that has shown its capacity to deal with a multi-ethnic and multireligious society-it will give India more opportunity to lead, particularly in parts of the world where people need to see how democracy can work and function in a proper way. And secondly, the American people have got to understand a prosperous India is advantageous to our own industries. I mean, we want people buying American products. Indians want Americans buying Indian products. And that exchange of trade in a free and fair way is beneficial for workers and consumers. And I said an amazing statistic today- at least I thought it was-300 million mid-dle-class citizens in India. That is larger than the population of the United States. And so we should not fear relations with India- matter of fact, we ought to welcome them and work on ways to strengthen them. That is really what the purpose of the trip is. Do you consider India to be a responsible nuclear nation? I do, particularly when they signed the IAEA safeguards, and they have a separation between their military and their civilian nuclear parts of their Government. ENTITY, would the United States have a problem if India continued to source oil and gas from Iran? I think people are going to have to buy their energy where they can get it. On the other hand, I do want to make it clear to the Indian people and the Indian Government that an Iran with a nuclear weapon will destabilize the world and that those of us who are for peace and stability must work in concert. So there is a difference between energy supply and working closely to achieve a very important objective. And we will discuss this issue carefully with the Prime Minister. There is a consensus in the world, and that consensus is that an Iranian Government that has declared its-has said that Israel should not exist, for example, and if it were to have a nuclear weapon, would be a danger to all of us. And I will continue to make that point with the Prime Minister. Why has the U.S. not questioned Khan, whose activities intersect proliferation and terrorism? Well, we were the nation that exposed the conspiracy to deal with- more than the conspiracy, the activities; let me rephrase that-we were the nation that exposed the activities of sharing technologies, sensitive technologies, nuclear weapons-related technologies. And we, of course, want to know as much about the Khan network as possible. But had it not been for U.S. intelligence, coupled with British intelligence, this network never would have been exposed. And the light of day helps understand proliferation. ENTITY, why does India have to jump through the hoops to get a civilian nuclear agreement when its energy requirements are similar to China, another big, growing economy? There are the nuclear supplier group and the IAEA-in other words, the world has signed on to this. We think it is in India's interest to do so, as it pertains to its civilian nuclear power industry. It will give confidence to people. It will make it easier for the United States to work with India. This will be a confidence-building measure that we do not believe is an unrealistic request. And we do realize there will be separation between the military side and the civilian side. What we are working on is the civilian side. Is the U.S. more comfortable dealing with dictators and monarchs? Do what now? Do I feel comfortable doing what? Dealing with dictators and monarchs? Do I feel comfortable dealing with them? No, the U.S. The U.S. feel comfortable with dealing with dictators? And monarchs. And monarchs? Well, I mean, I have got a great relationship with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain. She is a lovely lady and a great figure in a country that is an important ally. And of course, that monarchy is very supportive of a free and open and democratic system. You must take the words that I said in my second Inaugural Address very seriously, in that we must end tyranny in the 21st century. It is a goal that all of us can work on. India has got a unique role to play. I mean, when you really think about troubled spots, these are countries many times that are having difficulty dealing with what it means to honor minority rights and welcoming different religions within, kind of, a social and civil fabric. And India has done a magnificent job of showing the world how democracy can work. And it is -India is-I am confident the country will play a constructive role and can do so in a much better way-many times-than the United States can. I mean, after all, there are 150 * Muslims living within the Indian democracy. We got a lot of Muslims in the United States, as well, which shows the world that it is - you are capable of honoring-worshiping God as you see fit, and you can do so in a free way and, at the same time, be a productive citizen of a state. And India can help a lot. I was very impressed by its contribution to a new democracy in the neighborhood, and that is Afghanistan. India has provided $565 million of cash, recently pledged an additional $50 million to build the Afghan National Assembly building. And that is responsible- a responsible nation does that. And it is a- it goes to show-at least says to me that India understands that a democracy in our neighborhood will help yield peace, because if you study the history of the world, regions that had been in turmoil are now peaceful as a result of the evolution of democracy. And one of the points I made in my address to the Asia Society is that there are-there is more democracies now in the region, which will make it easier for a current Prime Minister, future Prime Minister of India to help achieve the vision that we all want, which is a peaceful world. India-U.S. Relations ENTITY, in this era of free-flow capital, why would-why are there so many restrictions about inflow of talent- human capital to the United States, who probably add wealth and knowledge-- I appreciate that question. I am-you are talking about visa restrictions for highly educated citizens. I am for lifting those. I think we ought to raise the level of those who are either educated here and stay here and/or come meeting high-with high skill levels. It is in our interest. I have always been a proponent of that. And likewise, I would hope that India would lift its investment caps. In other words-and part of the trip is to kind of work on ways to continue to develop this strategic relationship in a constructive way. It is a-you know, I said something interesting-at least I thought it was interesting-in the speech. I said, for a period of time, if you are a friend of Pakistan, you could not deal with India, and if you are a friend of India, you could not deal with Pakistan. And we have tried to change the relationships so that people recognize it is in their interest that the United States is a friend of Pakistan's, and people in Pakistan recognize it is in their interest that the United States is a friend of India's to help, if need be, reduce tensions. Right now the level of tensions are, relatively speaking, down. I can remember when I first came into office. You might remember, there was a series of incidents that got everybody quite nervous, and we had shuttle diplomacy-Colin Powell. And it seems to me that there is a renewed commitment to resolving problems. I thought it was very interesting that trade between the two countries has doubled, that there is , you know, new transportation hubs. That is all very positive in terms of resolving issues. You asked me about the relationship, how it is evolved, and I mentioned to you that as time passes sometimes and circumstances change, relationships are able to develop a new dynamic. I would hope that time and circumstantial change is enabling India and Pakistan to develop a new dynamic. It appears to be that way. Between a cricket match and a Bollywood movie, what would a-- Cricket match and a-- You like watching? What was the second? It is between a Bollywood movie and a cricket match. I am a cricket match person. I appreciate it. As I understand it, I may have a little chance to learn something about cricket. It is a great pastime. But, ENTITY, you are going to India, but you are not visiting the Taj Mahal. I know. It means I am going to have to-- Have you broken a promise to the First Lady? No, it means I am going to have to come back. It is a-I am disappointed with that. People who have seen the Taj Mahal say that it is -pictures do not do it justice. It is one of the great magnificent sites of the world. And look, if I were the scheduler, perhaps I'd be doing things differently. But you want me doing one thing. I will be the President; we have got the scheduler being the scheduler. I am going to miss a lot of the really interesting parts of your great country; I know that. I would hope that I would be invited back sometime after this trip. You could be in trouble with the Desperate Housewife. Yes. Well, she is certainly the star of the family. She is really looking forward to going with me. ENTITY, what is your earliest memory of India? Press Secretary Scott McClellan. We have got to go to the next one. What is your earliest memory of India and Indians? My best memory? Earliest. At least memory? Press Secretary McClellan. Earliest. Earliest. Earliest. Gandhi. It is my first memory, as I think about India-you know, a person who was so spiritual that he captured the imagination of the entire world. He is proof positive that-throughout history there have been individuals that have had the capacity to shape thought and to influence and-beyond border. And he did that. You watched the movie? I watched that too. But that is -but my memory was earlier than that. Thank you. Thank you very much.

{"id": 52, "text": "We will begin with a statement by President Bill Clinton. Buenos dias. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for giving me this opportunity to address so many Hispanic-Americans and Latino media markets all across the United States, Puerto Rico, and in 18 other Latin American countries. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss important issues with esteemed journalists from four major Latino radio networks: Radio Bilingue, MetroSource Network, CNN Radio Noticias, and Radio Unica. Tomorrow is election day in America. It is no ordinary election. It is, instead, an election that will determine whether we as a nation focus on progress or partisanship for the next 2 years. It will determine which direction we take into the new millennium. It will be determined by who comes out to vote. Our country is doing well now. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to serve these last 6 years and grateful that we have the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years, the smallest percentage of people on welfare in 29 years, the first surplus in 29 years. I am grateful that poverty rates are dropping among all Americans and minority Americans. I am very grateful that we have record numbers of new Hispanicowned businesses, for example. But I think we all understand that a great deal of work still needs to be done in education, in health care, in child care. We Democrats, we are running on an agenda of a Patients' Bill of Rights for all our Americans in health management organizations so they can have their health care decisions made by doctors, not accountants. We are running on an increase in the minimum wage. We are running on an aggressive program to improve our schools, with 100,000 more teachers and 5,000 new and rebuilt schools that are modern and good. We are running on a reform of the Social Security system so we can save it for the new century, and so much more. We also have run forthrightly on an open immigration policy and one America. And we have fought the Republicans on all these issues. I hope very much that we will have a good turnout on Tuesday. I am looking forward to this interview. But I will say again, these races are very, very close. There are almost three dozen close House races that could go one way or the other. There are seven close Senate races that could go one way or the other. And we need a strong turnout. Now, before I turn it over to the journalists to ask questions, I'd also like to say just one other word. Our prayers here at the White House go out to the citizens of Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, who have suffered so much as a result of Hurricane Mitch and are trying to put their lives back together. The United States is determined to help. We have provided over $2 million in funding for food, medicine, water, and other supplies. Two airlifts already have arrived with sheeting for shelter and food. Another airlift will take off today. In addition, foreign disaster assistance teams have been deployed to all the affected countries to coordinate our aid relief efforts, and we will be looking at what else we can do. This is a terrible tragedy for the people of Central America, and we will do what we can to help them to recover. Now I'd be happy to take your questions. Good morning, Good morning. At least 30 million Hispanics in the United States are anxious to know if their hopes will be supported by the Government. When there is an election, we are accustomed to hear all kinds of promises, and the election passes, and we are already accustomed to all kinds of frustrations. Will there be any difference this time, Mr. President? Well, first of all, let me say that you have some evidence here. If you look at my record as compared with the record of the Republican Congress, you know what the issues are. We passed this year in our budget- because we refused to go home without it- a Hispanic education action plan to put more money into schools with high Latino populations, to reduce the dropout rate. There is a big difference in the dropout rate of Hispanic children in America as compared with all other groups. It was a huge victory for us. We have continually fought for improved citizenship and naturalization activities to reduce the naturalization backlog. The Republicans have fought to delay naturalization and to complicate it. We have fought hard for a more accurate census, because millions of Latinos were not counted in 1990. The Republicans have fought for a system that will ensure that millions of Latinos will not be counted in 2000. We have appointed a record number of Hispanic-Americans to positions in the Cabinet, in judgeships, in other places throughout the administration. We have fought to establish the North American Development Bank to help to deal with the economic and environmental challenges along our border with Mexico. We have fought to put more money into education to open the doors of college wider than ever before, to put police on our streets, where we have the lowest crime rate now in 25 years, to help our children deal with the challenges of crime and drugs, and to give them strong programs after school so that they can stay off the street and in school and learning. So if you look at what we have done, if you just take this Hispanic education action plan, we have an increase of nearly $500 million targeted to help our Latino children stay in school, learn their lessons, and then go on to college. We have over $170 million committed to reducing the naturalization backlog. So these are not just idle campaign promises. In the closing days of this last session of Congress, on October the 21st we confirmed a Hispanic-American to be United States Attorney for the District of Arizona, to be the Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to be the Commissioner on Children and Youth in Families in the Department of Health and Human Services, to be on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many other jobs, including a couple of ambassadorships. So I am not just talking something for the election here. There is a huge, huge difference in the positions of the Democratic and Republican Parties in the Congress on issues that are vital to Hispanics in America. Good morning, Good morning. First of all, I was born in Honduras. I want to thank you very much for your words of encouragement to my Central American brothers. This is the worst tragedy in this century, and we are looking forward, all of you, to your support and your leadership in helping our countries build back. Thank you so much. Now, sir, tomorrow, November 3d, is the sixth anniversary of your first election as President of the United States. According to the latest polls, there are some very closely contested elections tomorrow, as you said, especially in key States such as California, New York, Illinois, Florida, and Maryland, States which have large Hispanic populations. The Hispanics backed you strongly in the Presidential elections of '92 and '96, and also in the midterm elections of '94. The Republicans have been running ads attacking you on the Monica Lewinsky issue. Do you feel these attacks on your personal conduct will cut down the attendance of Hispanic voters tomorrow or diminish their normal strong support for you and your party? I think it depends overwhelmingly on how people react to them. But just consider what the argument of those ads is. The argument of those ads is that voters, Hispanic voters and others, should punish completely innocent Democrats. In other words, they are saying punish someone else for this. And ultimately, the argument is, they are telling the voters they should punish themselves. They should say, Vote for us, even though everything we are doing is not good for you; and do not vote for them, even though they will vote for modernized schools and 100,000 teachers; they-the Democrats-they will vote for a Patients' Bill of Rights; they will vote to raise the minimum wage; they will vote to save Social Security; they will vote for a fair, complete, and accurate census. Now, the argument of the Republican ads is you should forget about all that, all those things that are about you, and play our partisan political game here in Washington. And that is basically been what the Republicans are saying. I do not think the American people will buy that. But what Hispanic voters need to understand is that the stakes are high here: the Senate seats in California and New York; any number of House seats in California; there are House seats up in Colorado, in New Mexico; a Senate seat and House seat up in Nevada; and the enormously important Senate race in Illinois, where Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has made a remarkable comeback in the last week; the elections in Florida; the elections in Maryland. And I could go on and on. There are about three dozen House of Representatives seats at issue here. Many, many of them have substantial Hispanic populations. There are seven or eight Senate seats at stake here, and several of them have substantial Hispanic populations; and then, of course, all these Governorships. So I would say, this election ought to be about the American people and their children and their future and whether or not we have done a good job for them and whether or not our ideas are best for the future. They would like it, the Republicans, to use their $100 million financial advantage in contributions to get everyone to forget that they have killed the Patients' Bill of Rights, killed the minimum wage increase, that they have killed legislation to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco, that they killed the campaign finance reform, that they killed the school modernization initiative, and get people to buy into their Washington power games. I think the American people know that my administration has been about people, not politics, about progress, not partisanship. And I think this election is very much worth voting in. But a decision not to vote is also a decision about what will go on here in Washington, DC, just as a decision to vote is. Good morning, It is quite an honor for me to take part in this conversation this morning. My question is as follows: The California children and families initiatives, which is known as Proposition 10, is to create programs for pregnant women and very young children, will be funded by cigarette smokers by paying a 50-cent tax per pack of cigarettes. Many in Los Angeles view this as another way to attack minorities as a proportion of people who smoke tend to be greater among minority groups. In your view, what are the long-term benefits of passing this proposition, and how would you convince the Latino community that this measure will actually be working in their favor? Well, I think there are two things I would say about that. The only argument against raising the cigarette tax ever is that it disproportionately affects low-income people, because if all kinds of lower income people, working people, smoke, it will take a higher percentage of their income to pay a 50cent-a-pack tax. But consider the benefits. First of all, it will reduce smoking among young people, which will prevent more people starting. And we know now 3,000 young people a day start to smoke, even though it is illegal for them to do so, and 1,000 will have their lives shortened as a result of it. Secondly, because the people are voting directly on this initiative in California, they are deciding, as they vote, how that money must be spent. So it would be illegal to divert the money to any other purpose. Therefore, you know that the health care of the people of California-and disproportionately the Hispanic population of California needs more money invested in health and education activities-you know that is where the money will go because that is what the initiative says. And under our law, if the people vote for it, they have a guarantee of how it will be spent. So you do not have to worry about what the legislature does, what the Governor does, what anybody does. You get to decide, okay, if I am going to pay this, this is how I want it spent. And your vote will do that. So those are the two arguments I think in favor of that initiative. I know that both my wife and I have worked with the people who put that initiative on the ballot and we trust them. We think that they are good people, and they certainly are trying to do something that will improve the health care and the future of the Hispanic children of California. Mr. President, in this campaign, we have not listened to any immigration agenda talks too much. Politicians do not talk too much about immigration. Is there any reason for that, or is there something going on that we do not know? Well, I am very happy to talk about it. As you know, I have worked very hard to reverse anti-immigrant provisions of the law. We now have reversed almost all the anti-immigrant provisions of the welfare reform law, just as I said I would do. We have beat back antiimmigrant legislation in other areas here. And I am working very, very hard to reduce the backlog that we have in the naturalization and immigration process, which I think is very, very important. So from my point of view, the whole issue of how to deal with immigration is very important. I have also tried to get changes in our law or changes in Justice Department policy to let immigrants stay here who came here under difficult circumstances many years ago and would otherwise have to now turn around and go back. So I want to see America continuing to have an open and fair and welcoming process for legal immigrants, and I believe that that is an important issue. I also think that is an important issue that all the voters should consider in this election, because it would be hard to find an issue on which the parties have differed more than the Democrats and the Republicans on the issue of immigration for the last 4 years. And I would hope that everyone who cares about this issue would think that that issue alone is a justification to go out and support our Democratic candidates. Thank you, Some closing thoughts about the importance of tomorrow's election? Well, again, let me just say that tomorrow the American people will decide on the Congress that will take us into the 21st century. They will decide whether it is a Congress that wants to represent all the American people and work for one America or a Congress that will continue to try to divide the American people in ways that undermine our ability to unite and to go forward. They will decide on whether they want a Congress that supports a Patients' Bill of Rights, that supports 100,000 teachers and smaller classes and modern schools, or a Congress that opposes those things; a Congress that supports an increase in the minimum wage, or one that opposes it; a Congress that supports protecting our surplus until we have saved Social Security for all the seniors in this country in the 21st century, or one that is still committed to squandering the surplus and endangering our economic strength in the long run so that we cannot do what we should do on Social Security. Now, these are big decisions. For Hispanic-Americans, you also have clear choices in terms of our commitment to a decent, fair, equitable, and accelerated process of immigration and naturalization, and their policy, which is to slow it down, make it more difficult, and do things which, in my view, are unfair to immigrants coming to this country. So there are clear choices here, and I say again, a choice not to vote is just like a vote for someone you do not agree with. This is a very, very important election, and I would just urge all of you to talk about it today and to go and vote tomorrow. Your vote is your voice.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithhispanicjournalists", "title": "Interview With Hispanic Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-hispanic-journalists", "publication_date": "02-11-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 58, "text": "ENTITY, time is of the essence. How do you consider right now the relationship between Israel and the United States after the summit? Well, I think it is very strong. But I think in view of the courageous actions that the Prime Minister and the Israeli team took at the summit and in view of the withdrawal from Lebanon, I think some review and strengthening is in order. I plan to have a comprehensive review to improve our strategic relationship. We are going to have talks that will start right away, with a view toward what we can do to ensure that Israel maintains its qualitative edge, modernizes the IDF, and meets the new threats that Israel and the other countries will face in the 21st century. Secondly, I want to have a memorandum of understanding done as soon as possible with regard to our bilateral assistance, with a goal of making a long-term commitment to the necessary support to modernize the IDF. I think that is important. The third thing that I think is significant is that we provide assistance, which we will do, to Israel, to upgrade its security in light of the withdrawal from Lebanon. And in that context, we also want to try to help the Government of Lebanon to strengthen its ability to control south Lebanon and to make progress toward a more normal existence. There are some other things that we are reviewing. You know, I have always wanted to move our Embassy to west Jerusalem. We have a designated site there. I have not done so because I did not want to do anything to undermine our ability to help to broker a secure and fair and lasting peace for Israelis and for Palestinians. But in light of what has happened, I have taken that decision under review, and I will make a decision sometime between now and the end of the year on that. And there are other things I think we have to be open to. But the main thing that I want the people of Israel to know is that the United States remains a friend and a partner, completely committed to the security and future of Israel, continuing to believe that a just and lasting peace is the best alternative and the only alternative for absolute security. But in the meanwhile, we have to do what we can to strengthen the capacity of Israel to defend itself and to deepen our bilateral relationship. So I intend to do that. You mentioned the relocation of the Israeli-of the American Embassy and put it in Jerusalem. Would you consider it in any circumstances, even if there is no agreement? Well, I think I should stand on the words I said. I have always wanted to do it. I have always thought it was the right thing to do. But I did not want to do anything to undermine the peace process, our ability to be an honest broker, which requires that we be accepted by both sides. But it is something that I have taken under review now because of the recent events. And I think that is all I should say about it now. So what is the next move right now? As I understand, Prime Minister Barak is saying that he is willing to go to another summit. What do you think is the next move? Well, I think, first of all, we need to have their people start talking directly again, and I think they will at a certain level. And then the Prime Minister needs to have a little time, I think, in Israel to deal with governmental issues. And I would hope that Chairman Arafat and the other leaders in the Arab world will work to prepare their public for the proposition that there can be no agreement without courage and conscience but also honorable compromise. That is what agreements are. The Palestinians did make some moves at these talks that have never been made before. And while I made it clear in my statement I thought that the Prime Minister was more creative and more courageous, they did make some moves, and the teams, the negotiating teams, for the first time in a formal setting where it counted, actually discussed these issues. Now, you know, there had been side papers and discussions and all that over the last 7 years, since Oslo, but nothing like this, not ever. And there is a reason when the Oslo agreements were signed that these final status issues were put off until the end: They are hard; they are difficult; they are contentious. But the fact that they were actually there talking and the fact that I saw changes emerge on both sides, including within the Palestinian camp, I think is hopeful. But what I want to do-first of all, I will do anything I can. I will be glad to convene another meeting. I will go anywhere, do anything, anything I can. But-- Will you consider a visit to Israel? Well, I just want to defer making any statements until I make a decision about what is the best thing for the peace process. I will act as soon as I can be helpful. We are doing things all the time, including now, today, as we speak. But I do not want to do something that is not helpful. And if we are going to make a difference, then the next time we meet, both sides have to be prepared to make the decisions necessary to conclude an agreement. And as soon as I am convinced that is a good possibility, I will do what I can to make it happen. You know, the discussion about Jerusalem during the summit opened Pandora's box in Israel. Can you assure the Israeli people that Barak is not going to divide Jerusalem? Let me say this. First of all, all the discussions that were held were private, and I have to honor that. What the Israelis and Palestinians decide to say about it is their affair. But I cannot be in the position of violating the trust of either side. What I believe is that Prime Minister Barak in no way ever compromised the vital interests of the security of the State of Israel. One thing I think that I can say without violating either side is that the most progress in the talks was made in the area of security, where there was a surprising amount of consensus and an understanding that neither side would be secure after a peace agreement unless both were secure and unless both worked together. And there was no interest, fundamentally, in the Palestinians in having a weak Israel, a vulnerable Israel, an Israel unable to defend itself; and that the Palestinians would be stronger if they were working together. I think if there is one thing that should be encouraging to the people of Israel, of all political parties and persuasions, it would be that. There was a clear willingness to try to come to grips with what were very different positions on this issue when they met and come together. And I was quite encouraged by that. You know, Jerusalem is a difficult issue. But I believe that the Prime Minister did everything he could to reach an agreement while preserving the vital interests of Israel. Israel is afraid that if Barak already made some concessions right now, and that the Palestinians did not make any concession-in Jerusalem-so many people are afraid that if the negotiations will resume, Israel will be asked to do, to make some more concessions. Can you tell the Israeli people that you would not ask Barak to give much more than what he already was ready to give? Well, first of all, I do not think that he will ever do anything that he believes undermines the vital interest of the people of Israel and Jerusalem. And it is true that while the Palestinians, themselves, did not make some moves on Jerusalem, that Israel did more, but nothing that I think undermined the vital interests of the people of Israel. And I think that is an issue where-and frankly, most of the discussion involved ideas embraced not formally by either side. And they are not bound by it. So I believe that everybody pretty well knows right now that there will not necessarily be a lot more movement of the same kind. And we may have to have a resolution in some ways that no one has quite thought of yet. But I kept telling the Palestinians, and I will say again to the world, that you cannot make an agreement over something as important as a city that is the holiest place in the world to the Jews, to the Christians, and to the- one of the holiest places in the world to the Muslims-if it is required of one side to say, I completely defeated the interest of the other side. If either side gets to say that at the end, there will not be an agreement, there cannot be. There has to be a way to identify the legitimate interests-and there are legitimate interests in both sides, in Jerusalem-in such a way that they are met and honored and that the sanctity of the Holy City is uplifted. There has to be a way to do that. But you know, it is not for me to design a plan. They have to come to it. And I think they will come to it if the people of Israel, and if the Palestinians will give their leaders a clear message that they trust them not to compromise their vital interest or their security; but beyond that, to be as flexible as possible to try to honorably accommodate each other's true interests. During the talks, did you consider the possibility that maybe Barak's concession will not pass a referendum? I did. Of course, he has to be the final judge of that. -help him with that. Excuse me? You can always advise him and help him with that, too. Well, if they reach an agreement that they both believe is right and honorable and protects their vital interests and their security, obviously I would do whatever I could to persuade the people to support it. I do not know that I would have much influence, but I would do whatever I could. I would certainly never countenance an agreement that I thought undermined Israel's security, but you do not have to worry about that. I do not think there was ever anything that was clearer to me in these negotiations. The people of Israel may differ with their Prime Minister on some of the details, but they should never question whether he had the long-term security and vital interests of Israel uppermost in his mind. That was clear. And as I said, to me something that should be very encouraging is that they really did make a lot of progress on the security issue. And Israel was, I think, the big winner there, but only because the Palestinians recognize that their security will be tied to Israel's security if they make an agreement. I am sure that you know that the majority of Israeli, the people admire your devotion to the peace process. And they ask themselves today if President Clinton cannot bring peace, which President of the United States will do it? Well, I would hope that any President would honor America's historic commitment to Israel and our decades of involvement in the Middle East and our attempt to be fair to the legitimate interests of all the people of the region, including the Palestinians. I do not know if anybody else will ever put the time in on this that I have or have the kind of personal, almost religious conviction I have about it. But keep in mind, this is an evolutionary process. If we do not finish-and I believe we can, and I still believe we will-but if we do not finish this year, the negotiating teams for the two sides and the attitudes of the people will be in a different place than they were because of all that has happened over the last 7 years, and especially because of what happened at Camp David, as long as there is a constructive attitude taken about it and a deepened resolve to be frank with the public and that this is especially important for the Palestinians. You are known as the tireless master of negotiating. What happened there? How can both leaders resist the Clinton charm? I am afraid my charm and my reasoning abilities, at least for just 15 days, cannot compare with the thousands of years of history that go to the core of the identity of Israelis and Palestinians, as regards Jerusalem. But that is okay. We made a lot of progress. We got people to talk about it, to deal with it, to think about it. And I hope I prompted a lot of thinking about all the various options available to them. There is more than one way to resolve this in a way that is honorable for everyone. But I must tell you, when we started these negotiations, I did not think we had a one-in10 chance to succeed. And we actually got more done than I thought we would. I called this summit because I was afraid that the lack of progress was spinning out of control. The parties, after all, promised each other they would reach an agreement by the middle of September. And they'd never even met to formally, frankly, openly discuss these issues-ever. So I think when you look at it in that context, it is -you know, if I were just sitting on the outside, and I did not know any more about it, I would be profoundly disappointed. I'd say, They have had 7 years. What have they been doing all this time? Well, you know what they have -we have had a lot of progress in the last 7 years, an enormous amount. But these final status issues were put off until the end because both sides knew they were potentially explosive and agonizingly difficult. So it was not really a matter of charm. Believe me, if I could have prevailed by charming, cajoling, arguing, or just depriving them of sleep, we would have a deal. The last 2 nights I went to bed at 5 in the morning both nights. I did my best so I would be the last person standing on both sides, you know, of all the sides there. But we just could not get there. And we will not get there until each side decides. And this is the decision I think Prime Minister Barak made. That he would go as far as he could without making any specific commitments, because we had it organized so that neither side would be exposed. So for people to say that he is bound by all these commitments, I do not think that is an accurate reflection of the way I conducted the negotiations. I went out of my way, especially as regards Jerusalem, to set it up so that if either side were willing to float some ideas or entertain some ideas, they would not be exposed, and they could always take them back if there was no agreement. But both sides-and this applies to the Palestinians; they are going to have to think about this-they have to decide that there is a solution which meets their vital interests, that does not permit them, after it is over, to say, I won, and they lost. You have to be able to be able to say, when this is over, We won. Peace won. Our children won. The future won. We may- yes, if we can get 100 percent of everything we wanted, no. Is it an honorable compromise that preserves our vital interests and enhances our security-not just maintains it, enhances it, yes. That has to be the test. The test has to be that our vital interests are preserved; our security is enhanced; our future is brighter; and neither side suffered a cataclysmic defeat. That is not what a negotiation is. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to be that Egypt and Saudi Arabia did not help to persuade Arafat to make the necessary concessions to have an agreement. It seems to be that this-both allies of the United States in this crucial moment could not deliver the goods. Well, I think that the truth is that because this had never been discussed before between the two parties and because when we went into the negotiations, they were usually secret or sacrosanct, that I am not sure, number one, that they thought they knew enough to know what to ask for, although I did my best to try to get them to help, in general terms, before the process started. But I am not sure they knew enough to know explicitly what to ask for, which will not be the case if we meet again, because we are down the road enough now. And number two, I do believe that the public opinion among the Palestinians, and throughout the Middle East, had not even sufficiently discussed all these issues. You can see it was still operating at the high level of rhetoric, you know. And at some point, there has to be a way of saying, We have won by making sure the Israelis did not lose. And the Israelis have to be able to say, We have won by making sure the Palestinians did not lose. And that is -it is harder to sell. When you are dealing with something as involved as Jerusalem in these peace talks, the only person who is going to get cheered is the person that says, no, no, no. And that is an easy sell. You go out and say, no, and you can get up the crowd, and they will cheer you. But if that is the attitude which prevails, then we will not get peace. There is right now in the Congress some proposal to eliminate or prevent the use, aid to the Palestinians if they decide unilaterally to declare about statehood. Hillary Clinton, your wife, is for this proposal. What is your approach? Well, the bill has just been introduced. We do not give a great deal of aid there, as you know. And a lot of it is-- But it is very symbolic. Very symbolic. Well, let me just say this. I think there should not be a unilateral declaration. And if there is, our entire relationship will be reviewed, not confined to that. So I do not -I make it a practice normally, when the bills are first introduced and I have not even reviewed them, not to comment. But I think it would be a big mistake to take a unilateral action and walk away from the peace process. And if it happens, there will inevitably be consequences, not just here but throughout the world, and things will happen. I would review our entire relationship, including but not limited to that. If there will be agreement, what kind of support the Israeli people can expect from the United States? I will do my best to get the maximum amount of support. One of the reasons I wanted very much to get the agreement this time is that it would give us more time to pass an aid package through Congress. But if there is an agreement, Israel will have further security needs. There will be human costs involved. There will have to be some sort of international fund set up for the refugees. There is, I think, some interest, interestingly enough, on both sides, in also having a fund which compensates the Israelis who were made refugees by the war, which occurred after the birth of the State of Israel. Israel is full of people, Jewish people, who lived in predominantly Arab countries who came to Israel because they were made refugees in their own land. That is another piece of good news I think I can reveal out of the summit. The Palestinians said they thought those people should be eligible for compensation, as well. So we will have to set up a fund, and we will contribute. I went to the G-8 in Okinawa in part to give them a report, and I asked the Europeans and the Japanese to contribute, as well. And there will be other costs associated with this. So it will not be inexpensive. Also, if there is an agreement and if the Palestinians set up a state pursuant to an agreement, Israel has a strong interest in seeing it be economically stronger and more self-sufficient, a better trading partner, not just a supply of labor but also a country capable of buying Israeli products in greater detail and growing together in the future. So there will be economic issues that have to be dealt with. I will try to get as much support as I possibly can for the United States but also as much support as I possibly can from Europe, from Japan, and from other people in the world. With your permission, ENTITY, can you take us inside Camp David and describe us one of the crucial moments, one of the crucial crises? Well, I think the only thing I can talk about without revealing the substance of the talks, which I have promised not to do, is the first time the talks almost broke up. Right before I went to Okinawa, I thought the talks were over. I even went by and said goodbye to Chairman Arafat. And I went by and said goodbye to Prime Minister Barak. And I was walking around talking to the Palestinian and Israeli peace teams. And it was obvious to me that they did not want to go and that they feared that, if they left in the position the talks were then in, that there would be an enormous harshness and recrimination, and it could wind up being a net setback, if you will, for the peace process. And then, all of a sudden, it became obvious to me that they did not want to go, that they wanted to keep trying, that they thought it was still possible. So I went back around; I made two more visits. By then, it is very late at night, and I am leaving at dawn the next day. It was like 1:30 a.m. or 1:45 a.m. I made two more visits to both Prime Minister Barak and his team and to Chairman Arafat and his team. And I finally concluded that they really did not want to quit. And so I invited them to stay. And I said that I had to go to the G-8 because the United States had some strong interest in Okinawa-it is a main base for a lot of our forces in the Pacific-and because I owed it to my partners to go there to my last meeting and because I wanted to ask them for money to help the peace process, but that if they would stay, I would leave Secretary Albright behind in charge, and they could keep talking, and they wanted to do it. That was, I think, the pivotal moment which turned this from a negative result to a positive result, even though we did not get an agreement. Because in the next few days, they relaxed; they began to talk. The Palestinians began to open up a little bit, and we began to get a sense that at least how we might get an agreement, even if the parties could not reach it this time. In my mind, looking back on it, I think that was a pivotal moment. Finally, I wanted to ask you, many critics of yours are saying that you are looking desperately for the missing chapter of your legacy, and maybe you tried to overcome the impeachment process. Is the Middle East issue the missing chapter of this legacy? No. Look, you know, I am not proud of the personal mistake I made, but I am proud of what happened in the impeachment process. As far as I am concerned, we saved the United States Constitution. And I think history will record it favorably to me and unfavorably to those who did it. And I think I have a pretty good legacy here with our economy, with our social progress on crime, on welfare, on education, on health care for the elderly, for children. And I am proud of what I have done in the Middle East, in the Balkans, in Northern Ireland, in Africa, in Latin America. This has nothing to do with my legacy. All my life, I have wanted to see peace in the Middle East, and I promised myself when I got elected President, I would work until the last day to achieve it. This is not about me. It is about the children who live in the Middle East. It is about whether those children will be living together or living apart, whether there will be fighting or learning together. And you are convinced it can be done? Absolutely. And if it does not happen while I am here, I just want to know that I have done everything I possibly could to make sure it will happen as soon as possible. But I am absolutely convinced that we can do it and that we should do it before the end of the year, because the parties have committed themselves to this September deadline. The parties came to Camp David; nobody had to come. Prime Minister Barak thought it was a good time, and I knew if we did not do it, we would never get around to dealing with this. We have a saying in America, this is like going to the dentist without having your gums deadened, you know? It is like having somebody pull your teeth with no painkiller. This is not easy. This was hard for these people. But if we had not started-you know, you never get to the end of the road unless you get out on the road and take the first step. And this was a huge, important thing.

{"id": 124, "text": "You have just announced a new $447 billion dollar Jobs' Bill. Right. And we all know that African-American unemployment is running really high, above 16%, nearly double that of whites. How does this bill specifically target them? Well, first of all, I think it is important to remember that we are going through the worst financial crisis and subsequent economy that we have seen since the Great Depression and so the challenges for everybody out there is tough. You are right; it is especially tough for the African-American community. The steps we took in the first two and a half years made a difference. It made sure that a lot of folks were still on the job that otherwise would not be. It made sure that states were able to stabilize their budgets, so they were not laying off as many teachers or fire fighters or civil servants that are providing services every day. But, you know, what we realized over the last couple of months is that because of a whole range of issues, including what is happened overseas in Europe, that the economy needs another boost, and we have got to focus more on putting people back to work now. And that is what this Jobs' Bill is? So the Jobs' Bill, overall, is designed to make sure that we are rebuilding schools and bridges and putting construction workers back to work. It makes sure that we are putting teachers back in the classroom. It makes certain that we are providing incentives to hire veterans who have been out of work, but also the long-term unemployed who are out of work. And it makes sure that we are providing tax breaks and tax credits to just about every family and every middle class person and every small business around the country. Now, with respect to the African-American community, they benefit from all of that, but in addition, we are making sure that summer jobs for youth are included in the package. Making sure that we reform our unemployment insurance so that, in addition to 1.4 million African-Americans getting unemployment insurance, we are also providing them a pathway so that they start getting some on-the-jobs training. All those things are going to have a huge impact in the African-American community. That is why we have got to get this bill passed now. Why not target the African-American community? Why not say then, This is for you. This is for African-Americans? If there was a banking crisis, then you'd target money for the banks. If there was a national disaster, you'd target your money for the National Disaster Relief. No. That is not how America works. America works when all of us are pulling together and everybody is focused on making sure that every single person has opportunity. And so when we put forward a program like, for example, the Health Care Bill, our focus is people who do not have health care. Now it turns out that the majority of folks who do not have health care are also working families, and are disproportionately African-American and Latino, but that does not mean that it is only for them. There are a whole bunch of folks all across the country who need help. And we are going to help every single person who needs help. Were their expectations way back when in 2009 too high? I do not think their expectations were too high. I think that people understood that it took us a long time to get into this mess; it is going to take a long time to get out of this mess. And I look folks in the eye all the time who do not have a job or who have lost their home or who are struggling otherwise. And what they tell me is, as long as I feel like you are fighting for me, as long as I feel like you have my interests at heart, then we are going to stand behind you. And that ultimately is the test. The test is not going to be whether we solve this problem overnight. The test is are we projecting a vision for the future. That is going to be one that makes sure that every kid in this country has a shot and that the middle class is still growing and the African-American middle class is growing. Because look, the fact of the matter is that it is a test for America how well those at the bottom do, not just how well those at the top do. And what is always made this country great is the belief that everybody's got a chance regardless of race, regardless of creed. And that is a vision that I think the vast majority of Americans still share. It is been tested over the last three years, but my job is to keep on pushing in that direction. African-American leaders have been critical of late. And it is true; you have said you are the ENTITY for all people, not just for one group. But once again, if you have a disaster in a certain area of the country, you are going to target money there. If I am a 16-year-old kid on the south side of Chicago, okay? My dad's gone. My mom's working 10 hours a day for peanuts. All I see around me is blight. There are no help wanted signs. And you will not even say, Look. I am going to help you, a young African-American? How do I feel? Emmett, first of all, that is not what people are saying. What people are saying all across the country is we are hurting and we have been hurting for a long time. And the question is how can we make sure that the economy is working for every single person? And the truth of the matter is, the vast majority of African-Americans understand that. They understand that when the economy goes well, then everybody does well. Now, there is certain communities that have been struggling even when the economy does well, which is why, for example, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program is going to be targeting communities that are having the toughest time. But the other thing I want to make sure that you do not just kind of slip in there with this notion that African-American leaders of late have been critical. There have been a handful of African-American leaders who have been critical. They were critical when I was running for ENTITY. There is always going to be somebody who is critical of the ENTITY. That is my job, in part, is particularly when the economy is going as badly as it is right now, people are going to have concerns. And they should. What I think you are seeing all across the board in every community is that when unemployment is high and people are having a tough time, then they have to feel as if there is some hope, there is some prospects out there. And right now, the economy has been bad for a long time. It was bad before I got elected, and it has continued to be very tough for a lot of folks. Until people actually feel better about the economy, they are going to continue to have problems and they are going to continue to hope that the White House can do more. What would you say to the man who stood on the podium back in 2009 that he did not know then what he knows now? Well look, there are a lot of things we know now that we did not know then. I mean, the day I took the oath of office we did not know that the economy had just contracted nine percent in the previous quarter. We did not know that 400,000 people had lost their jobs the month before and another 600,000 were going to lose their jobs the month after. So, I think the depth of the economic crisis worldwide was something that was glimmering on the horizon, but I do not think we fully appreciated it. The decisions we made were the right decisions: Making sure that a U.S. auto industry still existed and we did not lose a million jobs. That is a controversial decision, but it was the right decision. The Recovery Act, which saved a whole lot of jobs in America, even though the folks who did not lose their jobs may not have known that they might otherwise have lost their jobs. It was the right decision. So, you know, what I would tell myself if I traveled back in time? I would say it is going to be a long hard slog and the American people are going to, you know, feel kind of worn down after this much difficulty. But I'd also tell that less gray person to hang in there because the American people are resilient and they have good values and they care about the right stuff, and we will get through this. What would you have now done differently? You talked about the rings you did right with respect to jobs, you talked about the programs you were able to put through, you talked about some of the objectives you had. What would you have now done differently in retrospect? I think if we had had better information, it would have been important for me to able to communicate to the American people the fact that this was going to be a long process. That we were not going to fix this in six months. This was not your usual recession. This was a once-in-a-generation recession. And I think that might have helped brace people for the difficulties that were to come. The other thing that, as I reflect on it, is that in the first year or so we spent a lot of time just doing the right thing and not worrying about selling what we were doing. And I think that the more you are in this office, the more you have to say to yourself that telling a story to the American people is just as important as the actual policies that you are implementing. And they have got to have a sense of where it is that we are going to go, particularly during hard times. I sat down with you five years ago in the hallway of a junior college when you were still Senator. It was The Audacity of Hope book tour. Do you ever think back on those times? What reflections do you have, considering who you are now? You know, Michelle tells me at least that I am the same man now that I was when she met me when I was still in law school. I have a pretty clear idea about what is right and what America is all about. And it involves a belief that everybody gets a chance, that there is a sense that we are in this together. You know, we are a country that values individual initiative and everybody's got to work hard and everybody's got to be pulling their weight, but we look out for one another. And my politics really is based on those values, and those values have not changed. They are constant. And the longer I am in this office, the more I believe that when Americans are working together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. I have seen it time and time again. When we are divided, then we get less done than we need to. And part of my job is to help usher America through a very difficult time but still maintain that sense that we are in this together. One of the questions we had was, When? When is it going to change and how long will we have to wait? Well look, you know, right now we are in a situation where the economy is stabilized, but it is stabilized with too high unemployment rate. And I think if we get this Jobs Bill passed, that is going to make a difference right away. Some of the things though that have been plaguing the African-American community for too long, those things are going to take years to change. The school system in particular. Young people, it was just reported one group for example, is more insured than it is ever been because of the American, or Affordable Care Act. But, how we think about our health habits, all the things the First Lady's doing in terms of what we are eating, in terms of getting exercise, instilling good health habits in our kids- those are things that will take place over the years to reduce the diabetes rate, in the African-American community, for example. How do you get it through Congress? How do you make it successful this time? Well, we will get some of it through Congress. And we will just keep pounding away until we get all of it through Congress. And if we do not get all of it through Congress, and we have not seen enough done to help the American people, then we will get a new Congress. Because the bottom line is, that the vision that we put forward in the Jobs' Bill and the ways, by the way, that we intend to pay for it, by making sure that millionaires and billionaires are paying their fair share, that they are not paying lower tax rates effectively than folks who are making 50,000 dollars a year, that combination of efforts to rebuild America, put people back to work, get teachers back in the classroom and paying for it in a responsible way, that vision is one that the American people believe in. I mean, you were citing polls earlier. If you look at specifics of the Jobs' Bill, overwhelmingly, people support it, including a lot of Republicans. When you look at how we propose to pay for it, overwhelmingly the American people support it, including a number of Republicans. Now, this particular Congress may not be responsive to the American people, but we are going to keep on putting pressure on them until we can get as much of it done as possible. And if they are not doing enough to help the American people during a time of great need, then we will make sure that we have a new Congress. African-Americans are going to be watching you and asking themselves, Who is this man and does he care about me? What is it that they do not understand about you, do you think, that you would have them understand? All I get from the African-American community as I travel around the country is we know it is hard and we are praying for you. And we are behind you. And so, I think the main thing I want the African-American community to know is just those prayers are appreciated. Them rooting for me is appreciated. And that I am spending all my time in this office trying to make sure that if there is some kid in the south side of Chicago that does not have a shot right now, is not going to a good school, parent does not have a job, that I am fighting for him. And that is true if they are in a barrio somewhere in, you know, Los Angeles. It is true of some kid in Appalachia. That the values that brought me here to this office are the ones that I am going to carry with me when I leave office. And, you know, that is all I care about, is making sure that I am delivering on behalf of those folks who have invested so much in me. ENTITY, thank you. Thank you.

{"id": 292, "text": "Essentially, the America 2000 program, the criticisms that I have heard of -- and this comes from a sixth-grade teacher here in the central Ohio area here, Jerry Wilson -- who said that he thinks it relies really too much on testing, on memorizing things rather than teaching or learning. I do not think it does rely that heavily on it. I think parents and educators would like to see some yardstick. So, we are talking about voluntary testing to show people where they stand. Is your school measuring up to this school over here? Is this school better in math and science than this school? So to reach our national education goals -- one of which is, incidentally, math and science proficiency -- I think we need a testing program. I do not think all the emphasis ought to be on testing, however. But are you requiring the testing? Is that just by rote? Our students really -- -- Well, I do not think it is been designed. I do not think that the tests have even been designed yet. I think they can be flexible, but what they have got to do is show how a school compares with another one in this city or another State. And the idea that this kind of naive view that you do not need any testing, I think is ridiculous. I think we kind of went through that approach a while back, kind of a goo-goo approach that we do not need tests; we do not need anybody to know where they stand; we will just throw something out there at them. And I think you do need certain standards. One of the things I am excited about is trying to meet our national education standards -- first time we have ever had -- and it is not Republican or Democrat. It is all the Governors getting together. And Ohio now is getting out in the forefront of all of this. You like the Ohio 2000 program? I think it is off to a good start. Governor Voinovich has put together what they call a Team of 100, and they come from all walks of life, and they come from different parties. And I think what he wants to do is get down into the communities to reinvent the school. I do not know, some teachers might wonder about what this does to the status quo, but most of them, I think, feel inhibited by a lot of bureaucracy and certification and regulations. And I think most recognize, no matter how hard they are trying, that we are not as competitive in education for the future as we should be. So, we are getting good, broad support, not just from the business community and the local communities, but from the education community as well. That is not to say we do not have any critics. Right. Well, let me ask you, then, about being inhibited by regulations. There also is a lot of criticism that the Federal Government has too many regulations. Yes. For example, there is one program that if you buy computers under this program you cannot use those to teach disadvantaged students in the day and use it to teach adult literacy at night. Do you have any ideas on getting rid of some of these -- -- Yes, I do. And I think a lot of the education 2000 strategy tries to address itself to that, fights against mandated programs from Washington, DC. A big argument that I have with many of the entrenched committee chairmen in Congress is, we have got to do it differently. Do not tell Columbus, Ohio that they have got to do a formula like you have just mentioned, the same as a formula from Brooklyn or Beeville, Texas. It is not that kind of -- it does not lend itself to this kind of rote or mandate. So when a person expresses frustration like that, there is two things: One, we have got to avoid legislative mandates. Secondly, if the Federal Government, just by rulemaking and regulation, is burdening these communities, then I have got to do better in getting rid of those regulations that just tie the hands of innovative superintendents or teachers or shopworkers or whatever it is. California had a very good idea when they started reform in that State, was that any school district could apply for an exemption if they found a rule or a law that roadblocked them, and they would handle that. There are exemptions that can be applied for to the departments in Washington, and I think we have been able to handle some by exemption. But the big answer is to redo it, to start from scratch. And therein, we may run into problems at local levels, State levels. But so far, the receptivity is strong in the 25 States, Ohio being the 25th, that have adopted the America 2000 education strategy. One of the things I did in preparation for this interview, ENTITY, was ask a number of teachers and principals, if you could ask the President any question, what would it be? And the very first answer I got from Carol Price, who is a principal at an elementary school, was: What about funding? Obviously the bulk of funding for education comes from the States, but how are you going to pay for America 2000? States and local. Let me put funding in a broad perspective. And do not hold me within a billion to the month. In the early eighties, we were spending $160 billion on education. Now it is $400 billion -- $400 billion. And we are still not of proficient rank internationally to say that in the future we can compete or say to a parent, Your kid's getting the very best. I do not think it is a question of funding. America 2000 is not trying to tell the States how much money they have to put into each program. And our budget, of course, for the Department of Education is up. But I do not think that the Federal -- that the answer to education, if this is what Carol was saying, lies in vast increases in Federal funding. Federal funding is six percent, I believe, of the total education budget. She ought to look at how can we revolutionize this education to make ourselves be more efficient? How can we get the parents involved more? How can we stop getting too many mandates telling me, Carol Price, how I ought to run my classroom, for example? So I do not think it is funding. I mean, in some areas I wish there was more money brought to bear on a specific problem. But I do not think we can say, well, we are failing because we are not getting enough money from the taxpayers. I think, she is operating on a day-to-day basis where she sees how much she has for supplies and how much she has to buy new textbooks and then the available Federal monies that she can get that -- that was her concern. Well, she may be right, because in this instance she may be speaking right there from the heart with fact on her side. Because in some areas, some States and some communities, as they assign priorities in tough economic times, have had to cut back on things. But I would be surprised if she is saying, Hey, they are not letting me get the diversity of classroom implements I need; Federal Government, please send it. I think she is probably saying, Look, we are getting hurt here. The economy is down. People are hurting. And some of it is coming out of education. And I am a teacher, and I do not want to see it cut here. I want to see us go forward. So maybe it is something like that, that motivated her comment. One of the goals of America 2000 is a skilled, literate workforce. Are you proposing anything with vocational training? Yes. Adult education. Adult literacy. Adult literacy is a key, incidentally; the concept, nobody's too old to learn. I am sitting down, as kind of admittedly with some show business, but now fascination, learning to do a computer. By doing that, I have started to do that to show nobody's too old to be taught. And now I find I am using that thing for all the memos I send out -- they have taken my typewriter away from me -- and it works. And so we are talking here about more adult literacy programs, more adult education programs, but with flexible styling. Style them so they suit the needs of the communities, not back again to mandates, to be mandated from some subcommittee chairman in Washington, DC. Let me switch gears here for just a moment. The crime bill. I get the impression from the reports that you do not like the crime bill. I am very disappointed. We fought hard for anti-crime legislation that will support the police officer, a little less concern about the criminal himself. We have got good provisions in there for the victims of crime. And then it gets technical: habeas corpus reform, exclusionary rule reform. All of that is moved the wrong way in this midnight conference, or conference that broke up last night in the Senate and House. And looks like we are getting back to party politics. So I do worry that we are not going to be able to get for the American people the kind of tough anti-crime legislation they want. And I will keep fighting Congress until I get it. And if it comes to you, you would veto it? Well, I have to know exactly what is in it. But from what I understand the conference did, I'd have to. I'd have to. And there are some things in there we want. But you know, that is a problem with divided Government. I have to stand up and beat back things that I think are against the interest for the American people in order to get good legislation. So, let us see how it actually comes down to the White House. It may not even get there. It may not even get there this session. They may turn it over until next session. Okay. Thank you, sir.

{"id": 60, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for the first interview granted to Israeli TV and for hosting us in your beautiful ranch in Texas. Well, welcome. Thanks for coming. It is an honor to have you here, and it is an honor to speak on Israeli TV. I understand why you like this place better than the White House. We are on the eve of the disengagement, and you have expressed your full support in disengagement, trying to help Prime Minister Sharon in his struggle. And I would like to ask why is it so important to you, ENTITY? First of all, let me speak about my relationship with Prime Minister Sharon, if you do not mind. We have grown close, and one of the reasons why is I appreciate a person who when he says something, means it. And I hope he appreciates that about me. In other words, I said early on, we are going to join in fighting terror so that Israel could be secure and America secure and other free nations secure. Secondly-and I have-and he knows I keep my word, and I know he keeps his word. Secondly, what I appreciate is somebody who thinks boldly for peace. And Ariel Sharon came to the White House and said, We are going to disengage from the Gaza. And I was struck by what a bold decision that was. And the disengagement is, I think, a part of making Israel more secure and peaceful, and I agree with the Prime Minister. It is important because the United States is a strong ally of Israel and, therefore, if you are a strong ally, you want there to be peace for your ally. You know, the main concern of Israel is that the disengagement might lead not to more security but, on the contrary, to more violence. Do you understand the concerns? Oh, absolutely, I understand. And I can understand why people think this decision is one that will create a vacuum into which terrorism will flow. I happen to disagree. I think this will create an opportunity for democracy to emerge, and democracies are peaceful. And therefore, it is very important for the United States, as an active participant in this process, to encourage the formation of security forces that will defeat terror, just like the roadmap calls for-these are Palestinian security forces-and to encourage the Palestinians to develop a peaceful state. You had announced that you will support the disengagement by some aid the administration will provide Israel to develop the northern and southern-the Galilee and the Negev. Right. Has any decision been made regarding this issue? Well, first of all, I did say when the Prime Minister was here that the Negev and Galilee present great opportunities for economic development. And we understand that. So I am going to send teams over to assess the opportunities available for the United States to help Israel, and they will report back to me. But we have made no focus yet on specific budget items. ENTITY, are you troubled by the fierce opposition Prime Minister Sharon, your partner, is facing in his own camp, in the Likud Party? According to the polls, he might lose because of the disengagement. First of all, on democracy there is going to be dissent. And secondly, the Prime Minister has made a very strong, bold decision. And I can understand why people are debating the issue. But I am confident he is made the right decision. And I can also assure the Israeli people the decision he made has brought the United States and Israel even closer together. Have you any opinion about Mr. Netanyahu, who stands to succeed him and now is leading the opposition? Well, I met Bibi Netanyahu. Of course, he is well known in the United States. He is going to make the decision he thinks is necessary for Israel's good, and there is just a disagreement between two friends. But I believe the decision that Prime Minister Sharon has made and is going to follow through on will be good for Israel. And why are you so sure it is going to lead to more security? Well, it is an opportunity- first of all, the previous system was not working. I mean, there was an intifada; there was death; there was killing. And if you notice, there is been a calm in attacks. One attack is too many, but there is been fewer attacks. And I think in the long run, two states living side by side in peace is the ultimate solution for Israeli's security. In the meantime, we have got to work to dismantle terrorist organizations, and that is precisely what the roadmap calls for. How urgent is it that Mr. Abbas take more actions against terrorism? How urgent is it? Because you said that it is not enough, what they have done so far. Well, I think-and I have told that to the Prime Minister Abbas-or President Abbas. He is a strong-he strongly understands the need to dismantle terrorists. He knows that a democracy cannot exist so long as you have got armed groups willing to take law in their own hands, and he is committed to a democratic state. And we have got work to do with him, and that is why we have got a general on the ground there that is helping to try train and coordinate Palestinian forces to fight off the terrorists who would want to stop the process for peace. But would you accept a permanent ceasefire with the Hamas movement, for instance? Well, you know, Hamas is on the terrorist group. He made a ceasefire with them. Well, he is elected by the Palestinians. I am not. On the other hand, I can express my opinions to him, which I have. And I do not believe you can have a peaceful, democratic state with armed groups willing to take the law in their own hands. As a believer, ENTITY, what do you say to Jewish believers who think that God sent them to settle in the biblical Israel, and they will not obey any decision of elected government? Well, you know, there are admonitions in the Bible that does talk about the role of government relative to man. And Israel is a democracy, and democracies are able to express the will of the people. The Prime Minister is expressing what he thinks is in the best interests of Israel, and the people will decide, ultimately, whether or not that decision makes sense. You know, things in the Middle East constantly change. And nobody predicted the U.S. will start dialog with the PLO in the eighties, and then Prime Minister-late Prime Minister Rabin signing an accord with Yasser Arafat. Do you see any similar development with the Hamas in the future? Here is what I see. I see relations with a peaceful Palestinian state that is run by-that is founded on democratic institutions. That is what I believe can happen and should happen. I mean, in order to ultimately defeat terror, whether it be in Palestinian territories or Iraq or Iran, there must be open, transparent societies based upon rule of law. Your timeframe was a Palestinian state in 2005. Would you like to update the timeframe, ENTITY? I think Israel-the people of Israel must understand that now is an opportunity for the Palestinians to show leadership and self-government in Gaza. And that is why my focus is intensely upon Gaza. We hope that the disengagement goes well. And we understand that once Israel has withdrawn, it is now up to the Palestinians to show the world that they can self-govern in a peaceful way. You said that once the disengagement is carried out, both sides will help together to the roadmap to meet their obligations. And Prime Minister Sharon vowed that there will be no political progress until the Palestinians will act forcefully against terrorism. Do you share this view with him? Here is the way I view it. One, I think that the roadmap does call for dismantling terrorist organizations. And secondly, I think-I know that the disengagement from Gaza presents an opportunity for a Palestinian state which is peaceful to begin to grow. In other words, it goes to show that-that there is a chance to show the Israelis and the Palestinians that there is a better life ahead. And in order to do that in Gaza-in Gaza-- So the burden is upon the Palestinians once the disengagement is over? I think the burden is on-everybody has got obligations. You know, obviously, the peaceful withdrawal by Israelis from the Gaza is part of the burden. The terrorists-dismantling terrorist organizations is part of the burden. I think the-- Should it be the first-the first step before anything other happens? Gaza? The dismantling of the terrorist organizations? Well, I think that is a part of a process. You see, dismantling a terrorist organization is not only taking arms and isolating terrorists, but it is also showing the Palestinians and the Israelis that a peaceful state can emerge. This is what the opportunity is. And that is why I think that Prime Minister Sharon's decision was so bold. But we have a-let me finish the obligations. Israelis have obligations. The Palestinians have obligations. The United States has an obligation. That is why Mr. Wolfensohn and our general on the ground is there, to help establish the institutions necessary for a peaceful state to emerge. Arab nations have got obligations now: one, to not incite violence; two, to help isolate and bring to justice terrorists; and three, to provide funds to help these-the Gaza to become a place of prosperity and peace. You mentioned Iran, and I wonder, ENTITY, how imminently is the Iranian threat? There was a release lately of the U.S. intelligence that they will not have any capability in the next 10 years. Is this your latest information, ENTITY? My latest information is that the Iranians refuse to comply with the demands of the free world, which is: Do not in any way, shape, or form have a program that could yield to a nuclear weapon. And the United States and Israel are united in our objective to make sure that Iran does not have a weapon. And in this particular instance, the EU-3, Britain, France, and Germany, have taken the lead, been helping to send the message, a unified message to the Iranians. Look, in all these instances we want diplomacy to work. And so we are working feverishly on the diplomatic route. And you know, we will see if we are successful or not. As you know, I am -- And if not? Well, all options are on the table. Including use of force? Well, you know, as I say, all options are on the table. The use of force is the last option for any President. You know, we have used force in the recent past to secure our country. It is a difficult- it is difficult for the Commander in Chief to put kids in harm's way. Nevertheless, I have been willing to do so as a last resort in order to secure the country and to provide the opportunity for people to live in free societies. I will not be finishing this interview without asking you about your decision in Iraq. Knowing what you know today, you made the right decision, ENTITY? Yes. I did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein in power. Is it? Yes. Absolutely. Saddam Hussein-you know, we made the decision on a lot of factors. One factor, of course, is that the world thought he had weapons of mass destruction, not just the United States but the entire world. I went to the United Nations. The United Nations unanimously passed a resolution that said to Sad-dam Hussein, Disarm, or face serious consequences. Once again, he defied the world. But we also made the case that Saddam Hussein had terrorist ties. Abu Nidal was in Iraq. Zarqawi, the man who is inflicting so much murder and chaos on innocent Iraqis, was in Iraq. Saddam Hussein was an enemy of the United States, enemy of a lot of countries. And there is no doubt in my mind that we are safer as a result of him not being in power. And there is no doubt in my mind that a democratic Iraq will be a part of a change in the broader Middle East that will lay the foundations for peace. You know, a lot of the world says, Well, unless you are a certain type of person, you cannot live in a free society. I strongly disagree with that. I believe that embedded into everybody's soul is the desire to live in freedom. That is what I believe, that there is an Almighty, and the Almighty plants a sense of being free. Therefore, if given a chance, people will live in a free society, and free societies are peaceful societies. Any plans to visit in the State of Israel? I know you were there as a Governor of Texas. I was. What mostly impressed you in the Holy Land? Well, first of all, I will never forget waking up in the hotel and seeing this golden shine on the Old City. It was just-and I remember waking up Laura. I said, Laura, you are not going to believe-you are not going to believe this fantastic sight. The other thing, of course, that sticks in my mind was the helicopter tour I took of the West Bank, and my guide was Ariel Sharon. It was one of the great ironies of all time. I was a Governor; he was in the Cabinet. And he said, Would you like to take a helicopter ride? to me. Governor Cellucci, who went on to be the Ambassador to Canada, and Governor Leavitt, who is now in my Cabinet, and Governor Racicot, the four of us, we said, Sure, and we got in the chopper, and the tour guide was Ariel Sharon as we choppered all throughout the West Bank. Will you visit again? I'd love to visit again sometime. In your term? I hope so. And I hope to visit and proclaim success as a result of a bold decision that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has made, and I think I will be able to do that. ENTITY, I do thank you very much for this interview and for your time. Thanks for coming.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithisraelitelevisionchannel1crawfordtexas", "title": "Interview With Israeli Television Channel 1 in Crawford, Texas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-israeli-television-channel-1-crawford-texas", "publication_date": "11-08-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 405, "text": "ENTITY, on the oil spill, two questions on BP. One is my understanding is that the Oil Pollution Act caps their liability beyond cleanup costs at $75 million, so I am wondering how you will make sure that they do in fact pay other costs -- wages, et cetera. Let me check -- I would need to check with Interior on that, on the $75 million figure. I do not -- I think there are different provisions for different things, but let me take that question and try to find that out. I mean, is it your commitment that BP will pay all costs associated with this spill? That is our commitment, yes. Including like lost wages and that sort of thing? That is specifically one of the things the President spoke with Thad Allen about and with parish presidents and fishermen yesterday, is setting up a system -- and Secretary Napolitano talked about this, this morning -- setting up a system for compensation and claims that is not bogged down. Fishermen particularly are -- we understand what they catch -- they are going to sell what they catch in order to spend money to go back out and do it again. So obviously we have got to set up a system that is -- that provides for that to happen quickly. And just generally, what is your satisfaction level with BP's performance? Well, again, they are responsible; we have oversight. I did this a couple times I think yesterday -- look, there are many different things that we are focused on. First and foremost is capping this well. There were tests over the weekend on the application of sub-sea dispersant, which have thus far performed well and they are continuing to test that -- which is, instead of spraying the dispersant on the surface of the water, it is to release the dispersant near the source of the leak. And that had some positive impact during the first round of testing. The second -- the relief well began -- the drilling began on that last evening, which is a more long-term solution. Obviously BP is working on a structure to possibly put on top of the well and vacuum up the oil to the surface with the water to deal with that. So that certainly -- that is one aspect of what we are dealing with. Secondly, we are dealing with, as the pollutants rise to the surface, containing the spread of that oil on the surface of the water and how that affects both the environment that we are dealing with as well as the local economy. I would say all of those things are what we are overseeing. They are responsible for that. Obviously they have the unique equipment for dealing with this at a depth of 5,000 feet under the floor -- under the surface of the ocean. But we are going to continue to ensure that they are doing all that they need to do from the perspective of state, local and federal authorities. Secretary Napolitano, Secretary Salazar and Lisa Jackson are meeting this afternoon with BP to get an update from them on their ongoing process and to ensure that they are taking the steps that we feel are necessary to respond to an incident of this magnitude. My understanding is it is going to be the BP CEO that is having a meeting today. Yes. Actually the guidance I have has the CEO and the American chair. Can you tell me -- I have two questions, one to follow on BP, which is can you tell me who the President has actually spoken with at BP? And then also if any reaction on Ahmadinejad's comments that he made today? I do not -- I can check. I do not believe the President has spoken with anybody at BP. Obviously, they have -- Secretary Salazar convened a meeting with the CEOs of the oil companies last week. I think we put that list of folks out. Secretary Salazar was in Houston at the BP command center, and these individuals will meet with BP later on -- I think it is at 3:00 p.m. today. Look, I think the speech that you heard today was predictable in that Iran failed to speak about the obligations that it will not live up to. And I think rightly, our delegation and many others left as a series of wild accusations were made during the speech. Do you think it will have any influence on the movement toward actually getting some sanctions against them -- more sanctions? Well, I think the speech today -- I think those that have -- those that are involved in the NPT conference and are living up to the obligations would have wanted to hear the Iranians discuss living up to their obligations. I think them not doing that again shows how further isolated they are from the world community. And we continue to make progress on sanctions at a multilateral level even as we look at ways that we can do so within our own government. Progress, how so? Continue to meet with the U.N. Security Council and continue to make progress moving forward on a Security Council resolution. ENTITY, two questions. The first one is, we hear so many different time frames as to when this oil well will actually be under control. What is the best case and what is the worst-case scenario? I mean, I am hearing anywhere from a matter of days to 90 days in the worst case. What is your sense of how long -- Well, I would direct you to BP in terms of what they might say. Look, I think a series of processes that, as you said, could take a matter of days. I think -- I forget the exact term of the structure putting on top of the valve would take probably another week. The original well took 90 days to drill and it could take that long to drill a relief well. So if it takes up to 90 days, is that the something that the President is comfortable with? Well, I am not sure the President can alter the pace of drilling in the Atlantic. But that is what we are looking at. Look, we are -- I mean, in the Gulf, I am sorry. We are -- I used this phrase yesterday, as Secretary Salazar used this phrase, and that is we are going to do what we have to do. We will keep our, as Secretary Salazar said, our boot on the throat of BP to ensure that they are doing all that they -- all that is necessary, while we do all that is humanly possible to deal with this incident. Absolutely. I wonder, on the plane ride back yesterday, did the President share any personal reflections with you about what he saw on the ground, how he is feeling about all this? Well, I think the -- I talked a little bit about this on the trip home. You get a real sense of the topography, the geography of what we are dealing with, and how -- the President said that you could see from the air the -- the wetlands in that area, obviously, have undergone lots of change and not for the good over the past many years. The President said you could see that from the air. Speaking with the parish presidents, speaking with the local fishermen, you get a sense of what is at stake, both environmentally and economically. And I think the President reiterated to all of us, as he has said over many, many days, and that is we must do all that we can, as aggressively as we can, to combat this incident. ENTITY, I just want to follow up on that. When you say, keep your boot on the throat of BP, obviously sounds tough, but how do you actually follow up on it when, as was pointed out, the liability cap seems to be $75 million? Well, I will check on that before we -- Well, because Senator Menendez has a bill he just introduced today with other senators, saying he wants to expand it from $75 million to I think $10 billion. You said earlier, we want to set up a system to make sure BP pays more than just the cleanup; pays for lost wages, et cetera. What kind of system can you set up retroactively if the law is the law? No, no, no, the law provides for -- BP is the responsible party, right? So if local fishermen cannot fish, that is an economic loss that BP is going to have to pay. I am talking about setting up the actual system for the filing of those claims with BP and others in order to get them reimbursed as quickly as possible. That is not a retroactive thing, though. But if they are just responsible for cleanup and containment, can you really force them to pay the lost wages? Absolutely. That is part of the law. Absolutely. The economic damages that are incurred are part of the cost of this incident. Absolutely. And two other quick things. The Prime Minister Netanyahu call -- there have been reports that President Abbas may be coming to the White House in mid-May to try to get Mideast peace talks. Where are you on whether he is coming? Are you inviting him? I have no announcements on that. And then on the Supreme Court, where is the President in his decision-making process? We know he did some interviews, face-to-face interviews with potential nominees last week. Do you anticipate more face-to-face meetings this week? Is he close to a decision? Where are you? Close. Close as in? I could not agree more with your characterization. Close. So how close? Is he -- will he announce it this week? You know, I was thinking about this as I was getting a series of emails, will it be today, will it be tomorrow. I am happy to advise you of when the event is when we do announce it. I think it would be -- might be duplicative to announce each day when the event is not going to be. Well, but last week you did. You ruled out last week. Yes, I did rule out last week. Can you rule out this week? No. Okay, there you go. See, I just had a whole week's worth of duplicative email -- -- that is awesome. He has a lot of free time -- not free time, but I mean not public time on his schedule today. Chip, where you got the impression that the President has a ton of free time, I -- I am sure he is -- What are you guys watching at CBS that I am not afforded to watch at -- I mean, there is not a lot on his public schedule. I see. Okay. I am going to forward that along to him. Is he doing -- is he using that time to do some interviews with Supreme Court nominees today? I am not going to get into the interview process that the President has. I will -- safe to say, Chip, there is a lot on the President's plate and a lot that he is doing out of the watchful eye of the public. And today does that include Supreme Court? I anticipate that he is working on the process of the Supreme Court, without getting into the specifics of what those actions might be. What is his involvement, how actively involved is he in either getting information or whatever else on the Times Square situation? Yesterday, in traveling to the Gulf, John Brennan was with us, briefed the President on the helicopter ride from here to Andrews on Times Square. We spent about 50 minutes in the conference room of Air Force One on the ride down on the Gulf -- the situation in the Gulf. John got information throughout the day and passed that along to the President and has done so again today. And is there anything new on claims from groups overseas that they were responsible for this? Does the White House have any reaction to that? We are actively participating in the investigation, making sure that local authorities have all the resources necessary to determine who is responsible. We have not made that determination yet, but that is actively ongoing. On the boot on the throat thing, Ed said it sounds tough. Well, it actually sounds hostile. Is that an accurate reflection of the relationship between the federal government and BP right now? Is it a hostile relationship? Do you really need to keep your boot on their throat in order to get them to act? I think that is -- I think the expression largely conveys that while the responsible party is BP, we will do, as the oversight authority in managing the cleanup, the spread -- we are going to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything that it can and should do. The President heard yesterday from local officials that were concerned about the plans for -- the plans that BP had when the oil got closer to different parishes for extra booming and for different activities that could be undertaken. The President understands that frustration and worked -- Admiral Allen met with the parish presidents in order to get -- move the process with BP forward more quickly. That is the process that has been ongoing throughout this and will continue. Do you think the President feels like he needs to keep his boot on their throat? Is that the way he is reacting? I think the President accurately conveyed in his remarks yesterday that we are going to do everything humanly possible, and ensure that BP is doing everything humanly possible, to deal with this as comprehensively and as quickly as they can. Does the administration feel that BP has done a good job with this cleanup? Okay, so you are not ready to give an endorsement or -- Well, we still have an active incident. I think the President will be pleased when there is no more oil leaking from the floor of the ocean. The President will be pleased when we have taken sufficient measure to ensure that its spread is not vast. But I will say this -- I do not -- this is a process that is going to, as the President said yesterday, is going to take some time. To the extent there are any deficiencies in the cleanup process, does the federal government have some responsibility for that? You guys have taken pains to emphasize that you have been involved in day one directing and overseeing BP's response -- Well, again, that is the -- the law mandates, based on the incidents that happened in Alaska in the late '80s, to ensure that companies that cause these type of accidents do not hand the taxpayers of this country a bill and walk away. -- but in terms of what they decide to do or how they try to mitigate it? Well, again, we are -- that is why I used Secretary Salazar's colorful phraseology to talk about the role that we are playing and the role that Thad Allen as the National Incident Commander, and others are playing in order to ensure that BP does everything it can. So if Gulf Coast residents find the response in any way lacking, would it be fair for them to hold the federal government responsible as well as BP? The President is doing everything we can to respond. As you mentioned, we have been there since the very beginning in responding to the reports of -- the accurate reports of an explosion, with the Coast Guard assisting in the recovery efforts. That began our effort in this and it will not stop for quite some time. Can you say that the taxpayer, the American taxpayer will not face any cleanup costs? The commitment the President made yesterday is the responsible party will pay for this and that responsible party is BP. And regardless of caps or anything, somehow, something -- I will look into the notion of caps. I will look into that. And I know that the review is ongoing, but is there any way you can point to where -- what you are looking at? Is this a regulatory issue for the federal government, where regulators fell down on the job? Is it a technological issue? Where is this review headed? Jonathan, I think that the President's charge to Secretary Salazar over the course of the next 30 days is to examine every aspect of what may have gone wrong and contributed to, or caused the incident that we have -- that we are dealing with in the Gulf today. And his charge is wide open and I believe that what he finds will determine our next steps as it relates to offshore oil policy. When you say the company is responsible and the government has oversight, does that mean that the government is ultimately in charge of the cleanup? No, the responsible party is BP. But who is in charge of the cleanup operation? Who is calling the shots? The National Incident Commander is overseeing to ensure that BP does what is necessary. And then will the government ultimately hand BP a tab for every dime that, say, the Coast Guard, the EPA, and every other agency -- Yes. So there is like a running account of this? They will -- we discussed this in a number of meetings here last week, that specific actions -- these are the actions that we are going to take and these are -- this is who will pay for it, yes. And again that is -- and that is dictated by the law. That is dictated by the law. From the Valdez -- From the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Can you elaborate on what kind of a claims process you want to establish? Well, I can -- let me put you in touch with the Joint Information Center down there for a more technical analysis. But the President wants something that is not duplicative, that is not overly bureaucratic, one that -- obviously, you have got folks that are losing money because they are unable to do what they do for a living. Those are people that cannot be out of -- if that is how you make your living, losing that money is a very big deal. We want to make sure that that money is made up as quickly as possible. Thanks. ENTITY, does the President have any plans or does he want to meet with the CEO or president of BP? Or is it just a matter of they have not gotten the schedule together yet or -- Again, I think the -- I think those that are meeting with him -- with the CEO and the president today are -- and again, Secretary Salazar has been in touch with folks at BP throughout this. On the dinner tonight, the Executive Committee dinner, will the President be sounding out any members of the Executive Committee on a new program or new policies in advance of his speech tomorrow? Well, look, I think the President -- there is obviously a lot on the Senate's docket right now in terms of financial reform. I think the President will reiterate his support for, and ask business for their support for, financial regulations, discuss the efforts that the administration is currently undertaking to rebuild the economy and to put in place an environment for continued hiring. We are hopeful and optimistic that by the end of the week, we will have another positive month of job growth. Will there be a readout? I will check. I do not know what we are going to do on that yet. One last thing. You mentioned financial reform. There is a package of amendments being proposed for the financial reform pending in the Senate. One of them is calling for a tax on excessive bonuses on firms that got individual assistance from the government. Does the President support that? I have -- I'd have to have those guys take a look at the amendment. Has BP been truthful with the administration? Can you -- In all of its -- either representing what its doing, what it is capable of doing, in its understanding of how much oil was leaking? At any point in the communication with BP, does the administration believe it is gotten willfully errant information? I would have to ask somebody at the Department of the Interior or Homeland Security if they felt otherwise. Major, our focus has been throughout this process to plan for the very worst and to ensure that our response flowed from what could be the very worst. So that is what has governed our actions since the night of the explosion when the Coast Guard came to the assistance of those that had been hurt and those that were missing. The reason I ask, the boot on the throat metaphor indicates or suggests at least to those who might hear it for the first time that something went awry or has gone awry with the relationship, and the administration or the federal government needs to be much more forceful to force an intractable partner to do something they otherwise would not do. I mean, it suggests that the cooperation has broken down. Maybe I am just from a different part of the country. Would hold your feet to the fire, would that be something more that would be understandable to -- I am just asking why that metaphor -- I am glad I did not wear my boots today, right? I do not know, holding your feet to the fire could create some pain, Chip -- again, I -- maybe you guys do not go camping either. The law creates this sort of partnership that is being worked out for the first time in real time where the industry -- Well, I do not think this is the -- I do not think this is the first time that -- Of this magnitude. Okay, so not the first time, but the first time -- right -- of this magnitude. Look, again, I cannot phrase it any differently than the President has over the past many days, which is it is our obligation to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything within their power to cap the well; to respond to the pollution that has -- that is on top of the water; to ensure that we are doing all that is necessary to ensure that we mitigate its spread, and where it does spread and interrupt economic activities for local communities, that that is being dealt with. I think those are all -- that is the full range of things that we are supervising. For those who wonder and ask the question, what was the time lapse for the designation of an incident of national significance? Can you walk us through that? Yes, I -- Because when I talked to Thad Allen on Friday, he said you really have to look at this as two calendar events -- the explosion, the search and rescue, putting out the fire; then a catastrophic leak. He said you really need to measure these as sort of two separate instances of intervention at the federal level and with BP. Do you view the calendar that way, and that day one is when the leak became the top priority after dealing with the explosion and the search and rescue and everything else? Well, first and foremost -- again, first and foremost, the Coast Guard arrived on the scene I think with four vessels over the course of some period of time after the explosion -- I think that happened at roughly 10:30 p.m. that night -- to assist in the fire that was ongoing and to ensure that all that could be was being done to get folks that were injured off, and to look for those that were missing. I think pretty quickly after that, though, it is pretty clear that there is, for whatever reason, oil in the water. The response -- I think there were -- I'd have to go back and look at my notes -- I think there were some 70 vessels in the water, there were scores of planes in the air, dealing with this even at that point of designating it a spill of national significance. This is a response that has been ongoing since the report of that explosion some many days ago. How would you characterize what happened in Times Square? Was that an act of terrorism? I think anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, I would say that that was intended to terrorize, absolutely. And I would say that whoever did that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes. We do not know who is responsible and that is what we are looking at now. In the speech at the U.N. today, does it in any way lead the administration to say, okay, the door is now closed? I mean, you are not going to come to your -- to live up to your obligations is the formulation from this podium and elsewhere -- does it do anything to narrow the ability of this administration to wonder aloud if Iran is going to do anything different? I think the likely -- I would say this. The offer is still there. The likelihood that they will take that offer and walk through the door seems -- they seem, and I think through their words and their actions, unwilling to live up to their obligations. That is why we have got a dual-track approach going to ensure that if they fail to live up to those obligations, that we take those next steps. Last question. Does the President have any reaction to immigration -- No, no, no -- -- the immigration protests all over the country this weekend? Look, I think the President for quite some time, dating back to his membership in the Senate, is somebody who is pushed for comprehensive immigration reform. I think regardless of what side of the political argument you are on, I do not think there is any doubt that what has happened in Arizona leads you to understand that this town has to act on something that is comprehensive, lest we have an immigration policy through -- by 50 states. The timing will depend, I think, quite frankly, Major, on willingness from individuals in both parties to step up and meet those obligations. How intensively is the President monitoring the Greek debt crisis, and what does he think the long delay in the Europeans getting together to actually do something about this says about their cohesion? Let me point you to Treasury for the response to the latter. The President has gotten updates throughout this process on a number of occasions. Time has been taken in the President's economic briefings that happen most days to go through -- that go through what is at stake. Does he worry that it will have an effect on U.S. recovery? Well, we have certainly talked about the notion that -- look, we are happy with the steps that Greece says they are going to take and happy with the response. Obviously anything -- we are greatly concerned about anything throughout the world that could cause a disruption in the continuing recovery of the global economy. That is something that the NEC, the CEA, and the Treasury have looked at throughout this process. Only two questions, ENTITY. It is early in the week, Lester, but I am ready. Thank you very much. In view of President Franklin Roosevelt's 998 press conferences, why has President Obama held not a single White House press conference since last July? Lester, what would you -- let me ask you this. Can I ask you just -- I just have one question. You can ask me as many as you wish. Excellent. I am just going to use one. When the President took eight questions from members of the White House press corps at the Nuclear Security Summit at the Washington Convention Center, what would you call that? That was not a press conference. What would you call it? It was a select few. A select few what? A select few reporters. It was not a White House press conference. That was my question. Well, can I ask another question? I do want to -- I am going to -- Of course you can. I am going to -- can I take Chip's thing and just ask one more? What differently do you think the President would have done at the Nuclear Security Summit in taking the eight questions from members of the White House press corps that might have denoted -- might have tripped your definition of a press conference? It would be a wonderful thing if he had allowed all reporters -- just it would be wonderful if you would allow these front-rowers two questions and then go all the way back to the back and then come back and let them start again. That would be fair. Thank you very much. Lester, you are a happy occupant of the front row today and I hope that you will -- No, it is not the front row, it is the second row. Front rows today -- pardon me. I hope that you will take the opportunity to speak with each one of these members individually. Now, I did not -- I do not -- I hope you did not dodge my second question. No, I try not to dodge. Okay, I just -- I am trying to figure out -- the President answered eight questions from the White House press corps. Unclear -- I will admit -- But only eight of them -- only eight selected. Okay, so how many unselected would it have checked your box as to being a White House press conference? I think that if he wanted a press conference, he would have invited all of us, not just a select few, which he does so often. Lester, I do not -- were you at the event? Did you apply for credentials to come to the event? I would be delighted if I thought there was any chance. No, no, but I asked you, did you apply for credentials to come to the event? No, I did not. So you were offered the opportunity but declined to do so? I do not know if you saw the hall that we were in -- it is a whole lot bigger than where we are. It is a whole lot bigger than the East Room. -- you only had eight. There were a whole lot of people there. Again, I just -- can you give me a number? Is it a number thing that would -- you think if we would have -- if it was not eight, it maybe was like nine? Well, there is 47 that are here today. So 47 -- Sitting, and eight more standing. Right, so 47 and 8 is 55. So the President would have taken -- if the President took 55 questions, would that have -- John Kennedy took 20 -- no, 38 questions in his first press conference. You remember that, do not you? So it is not 55 -- it is not eight, it is not 55, it is 38? Can I go to my second question? No, I am just trying to get an answer to my second question. I suddenly have found this to be wildly amusing. You are an enormously amusing man. And inexplicably, I am finding this to be equally amusing. I am just trying to -- just help me out, Lester, because we have now established that 55 is probably a lot, right? Thirty-eight you said Kennedy took -- so that could be an early entrant for the number of questions in which it is possible for the event to be designated a press conference. Eight appears on your measure to be too small. Are you comfortable with somewhere between eight and 38? Or do you want to -- is there a more specific number that you want to -- I understand that 90 -- that 90 reporters usually come to those -- So we got a 90. That is -- apparently 55 seems to be quite in the middle. And then there is 60, the number we need to end this filibuster. If he could give shorter answers and only recognize them for two -- Let us move on. Let us move on. -- he'd get through a lot. But I want to ask my second question, if I may. Okay, will the transcript please -- just you can just put this in parentheses -- -- more questions -- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Goyal. I am -- this is my press conference. Can you just put in parentheses that it appeared as Lester did not answer my second question, but we had like 90, 55, 38 and eight to the -- now, I will -- just for a point of personal privilege, it is unclear as if Lester's definition of the President ever having participated in a White House news conference would have been the case because I do not believe that -- I do not believe the President has ever taken 38 questions at one event. It is the last one. What is the President's reaction to how Mexico treats illegal aliens from Central America as detailed by syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin? I am not aware that the President -- I mean they are very tough in enforcing that border. I will take a look at that. On the Times Square incident, is this like the incident on Christmas Day in that it was a missed -- it was a near-miss? Remember how angry the President was on screening for the flight that came into Chicago on Christmas Day? Does this -- Detroit -- -- does this incident represent in Times Square on Saturday night represent an incident where they just lucked out and a terrorist incident did not happen? I think the President and the mayor have both mentioned that as you have heard for many years, if people see suspicious activity to quickly alert the authorities. The President -- Bill handed me a note that the President spoke with Duane Jackson to commend and thank him for his vigilance in alerting authorities -- and for those authorities acting quickly to prevent anything from becoming -- anything from happening as a result of what was placed in that car. The police have apparently now questioned the original owner of this car. And it appears that it was sold without any paperwork in Connecticut I think last month. Does that kind of information reach the President? Yes. Yes. Anything more you can tell us about the -- No. That was some of the updates that John provides the President. ENTITY, you all have pointed to the meeting the President had in the Oval Office on the day that the rig sank, and there were a lot of people there -- Napolitano, Salazar, the FEMA boss, Admiral Allen. How unusual is that kind of meeting? Can you give us some context of how high on the radar screen that something gets when you have that many folks? Well, look, obviously that was -- obviously, leaving aside sort of where we have gone from the 22nd, obviously a rig of that size, an explosion, 11 people dead, that sinking into the Gulf is something of great importance. And the best way -- I think the President would believe, and I think many people would believe -- the best way to get the most up-to-date information as to what everybody is doing in real time is to do something like that. Look, the President's involvement though -- later today, the President is going to speak with the governors of Tennessee and California about the flooding -- I am sorry -- Tennessee and Kentucky -- about the flooding that is going on there. And I think our FEMA Director is headed to that region later today. So whether it is a large meeting or it could be just a discussion with each of the governors to get what is going on on the ground, I think that provides the President and the team with a lot of information. Yesterday was a good -- when we got to the command center in Venice, you had representatives from -- you had the governor, the lieutenant governor, the parish president, the Coast Guard, the EPA, all giving input into what was going on, what they wanted to see happen differently, along with senior staff members from here at the White House that can work out any kinks in the command chain. ENTITY, there are reports today that the chairman of the FCC is leaning towards abandoning his push for rules that would ensure what some call net neutrality, something that would obviously be a big blow to public interest groups, as well as many supporters of the President. What is the White House reaction? Let me get an update on where that is without going off of what may or may not happen. Why was New Jersey canceled? I do not think that is what George meant. But we discussed travel for the next few days; on Friday, thought that moving -- obviously, when he goes there is a lot of assets that need to be moved. Those assets were moved in order to support our trip to the Gulf. And we look forward to going back, but it will not be on Wednesday. Sheila Bair has been urging lawmakers to scrap this plan for a derivative regulation, saying it will destabilize banks and also drive risks to other parts of the financial sector. What is the White House reaction? I saw the article. I have not talked with folks in the administration. Obviously, what was contained in the President's original -- in the original plan was to ensure that derivatives were -- these were activities that were moved out of the dark and onto regulated exchanges. We continue to believe that that is a strong route to go to ensure that what is happening is regulated. I have not spoken specifically as to what Sheila Bair had to say. Can you describe the chain of command on a minute-to-minute or a day-to-day basis in terms of the cleanup and trying to staunch the flow of the oil leak? In other words, does Admiral Allen tell BP, okay, you have got X number of submersibles; we want them down there doing this, that, or the other thing? As BP endeavors to create this cofferdam, is the United States giving advice on the design of the cofferdam, resources or facilities to build the cofferdam? Let me -- on the cofferdam, let me get some information from the Joint Information Center. Look, obviously, this is a response that touches on a lot of different departments, right? The Department of Interior -- Minerals Management has purview over drilling; DHS over incidents; when pollutants hit the land it becomes EPA. Obviously, Thad Allen, as a result of the declaration, is the National Incident Commander and -- Right, but I am talking about the federal government. All those entities together, regardless of their distinctions and what their jurisdictions are, who is calling the shots in terms of the deployment of the resources and the technology of -- the government does not have submersibles, BP has the submersible. So does any one -- or any one of those agencies dictate when that submersible goes down, what it does down there? Those submersibles by BP have been in the water, the robotics -- look, they are doing what they can do safely at the site in order to try to fix the valves, to get as accurate a picture as they can of what is happening underwater. You see -- and I think some pretty specific diagrams and explanations of where these breaches are, which is governing the engineering of the instrumentation to put on top of that leak. But, again, we have got -- today we have got Interior, Homeland Security, and EPA -- Thad Allen is not at that meeting, had to -- was doing something else at that time -- but all these people are ensuring that BP is doing what they need to do. ENTITY, what kind of discussions have there been between this administration and the British government in terms of the spill? Any at all? I can check on that. I do not know off the top of my head. I want to follow up on that and also on Israel. On the British government, if BP defaults or goes bankrupt, does the British government have any obligation to help pay this huge, multibillion debt? That is a legal question that I do not know the answer to. Could you look into that? Yes, I will certainly look into it. And on Israel, did you get into specific topics -- settlements, Jerusalem, and so forth? Nothing more than the readout that I have here. Last Friday, Senator Bill Nelson said that a energy legislation that included a component of offshore drilling would be dead on arrival. Lindsey Graham today says, we have had problems with car design, but you do not stop driving, as a way to suggest that you continue the offshore drilling. Has the administration's viewpoint of this evolved since last week when you said it would affect possibly the plans, but you were not ready to talk about it? Sam, the President was specific in ordering Secretary Salazar to look at all the possible aspects of what could or did go wrong in this instance, to report back to him in that 30-day period -- after that 30-day period of time, and that this is an administration that is going to take whatever information we get from that and have that dictate our decision-making going forward. I think it would be premature to get too far ahead of where Secretary Salazar's investigation is, even as our priority, Sam, is to plug the leak in the floor of the ocean, deal with the spread of the oil on the surface, to ensure that we are doing all that is possible to prevent environmental and economic damage. So you have not gotten enough information to fully rule out further offshore drilling and amend your legislation? The investigation, Sam, is to determine what happened and to use that information going forward to dictate any changes in our policy -- understanding this, Sam, that -- I forget the number of active wells that are currently in the Gulf. I mean, the Gulf is -- this area of the Gulf was, if I am not mistaken, largely unaffected by the President's announcement on the Outer Continental Shelf. So I do not know if what you -- if your question was to ask how this affects the President's announcement, or how does this affect any drilling that is done in the Outer Continental Shelf. I want to know how it affects the administration's proposal for offshore drilling -- And I would point you to what Secretary Salazar will ultimately report to the President.

{"id": 208, "text": "Good morning. Sorry I am a little late. And I am due at the please, have a seat the National Cathedral at a little after 11. But good morning. Today we have got some good news, good news about the economy. For the sixth month in a row, inflation has come down. Measured over the last 12 months, it has fallen 6.5 to 6.5 percent. That is down from 7.1 percent the month before. And it is down from 9.1 percent this summer. Inflation is now at its lowest level since October of 2021. When we look at the just the last 3 months, we see that inflation fell to 1.8 percent on an annualized basis. It is down from more than 11 percent in the first 3 months of last year. So the data is clear: Even though inflation is high in major economies around the world, it is coming down in America month after month, giving families some real breathing room. And the big reason is falling gas prices. My administration took action to get oil onto the market and bring down prices. Now gas is down more than $1.70 from its peak. And that adds up to a family with a typical family with two vehicles to a savings of $180 a month, every single month, that stays in their pockets instead of being spent at the pump. Food inflation is slowing as well. Last month, we saw the smallest increase in food prices in almost 2 years. And much of that increase was due to the avian flu outbreak, which has driven up the egg prices around in the United States. It is not just gas and food prices though. When we look at what economists call core inflation, which takes out energy and food, we see welcome news as well. Core inflation is down to the lowest level in a year. Over the past 3 months, core inflation has come down to 3 percent on an annualized basis. That is down from more than 6 percent at the beginning of 2022. The cost of goods is actually falling as prices for everything from computers to used cars are coming down as well. And inflation in the core services is moderating as well. You know, and as inflation is coming down, take-home pay for workers is going up. Workers' wages are higher now than they were 7 months ago, adjusted for inflation. Wages for lower-income and middle-income workers have gone up even more. It all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families, and more proof that my economic plan is working. When I came into office almost 2 years ago, the economy was flat on its back, as you will all remember. Millions of people had lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Millions millions who kept their jobs saw the hours and paychecks cut. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses permanently closed their doors. People were hurting badly. That is what we inherited. The pandemic was raging, and the economy was reeling. We acted decisively to put in place a new strategy that would build a rescue would rescue the economy from the pandemic downturn. At the same time, we laid the foundation for a stronger, more resilient economy for decades to come, an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out. Now, 2 years in, it is clear clearer than ever that my economic plan is actually working. Here is what we have learned just last week. Unemployment is the lowest it is been in 50 years. I will say that again: the lowest unemployment rate in a half a century. My first 2 years in office were the 2 strongest years for job growth on record. We created nearly 11 million jobs, including 750,000 manufacturing jobs. And they were the 2 of the strongest years ever for small-business creation as well. And today, unemployment rate is near record lows for Blacks and Hispanic Black and Hispanic workers, near record lows. And it is the lowest ever on record for people with disabilities. We are seeing American families breathing a little easier. More Americans have health insurance than they did ever in our history. Fewer families are facing foreclosures today than before the pandemic. And we still have more work to do though, but we are clearly moving in the right direction. And there are more there is more breathing room in store for American workers and families. Starting last week, as of January 1, a month's supply of insulin is now capped at $35 for seniors on Medicare. Some were paying hundreds of dollars every month for their insulin, but not anymore. Starting last week, if Big Pharma raises prices faster than inflation, they are going to face big penalties. Starting last week, Americans can get tax credits when they install energy-efficient appliances in their homes, like heat pumps or solar panels, or when they buy electric vehicles. These were all pieces of what that big law that we passed last year. Now, they are kicking in and Americans are starting to feel the benefits in their everyday lives. But that is not all. We are seeing historic investments in American manufacturing turn into new factories and new jobs from Arizona, Ohio, Georgia, New York. Companies have announced nearly $300 billion in manufacturing investments here in the United States since I became President. Instead of exporting jobs, like we did for decades, we are now creating jobs and exporting product. Creating jobs and exporting product, that is the idea. Now, the House has elected a new Speaker. I called to congratulate him, and I am ready to work with him or any Republican in Congress to make progress on the American on the for the American people. But like many Americans, I was disappointed that the very first bill the Republicans in the House of Representatives passed would help wealthy people and big corporations cheat on their taxes at the expense of ordinary, middle class taxpayers. And it would add $114 billion to the deficit. Their very first bill. House Republicans campaigned on inflation. They did not say, if elected, their plan was to make inflation worse. Plus, House Republicans introduced another bill: blocking action that would help lower gas prices and help consumers. And on top of that, House Republicans are preparing to vote on a national sales tax bill. National sales tax, that is a great idea. It would raise taxes on the middle class by taxing thousands of everyday items from groceries to gas, while cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans. And if I am not mistaken, what they have introduced it also would totally eliminate the IRS. It feels good, except all going to be sales tax. Go home and tell your moms. They are going to be really excited about that. Come on. Is this how House Republicans are starting the new term: cutting taxes for billionaires, raising taxes for working families, and making inflation worse? Well, let me be very clear: If any of these bills make it to my desk, I will veto them. I will flat veto them. I am ready to work with Republicans, but not this kind of stuff. If they try to cut Social Security or Medicare, which Americans have been paying into with every paycheck since they have ever have had got their first paycheck, I will use my veto pen to stop that as well. But if Republicans want to work together on real solutions to lower inflation, create more jobs, build an economy that works for everyone, I am ready. Let me close with this. Today's inflation numbers are good news good news about our economy. And we have more work to do, but we are on the right track. We are seeing bright spots across the country where great things are happening. Roads and bridges are being built. Factories are coming on line. People back to work again. Families breathing a little bit easier. That is why I can honestly say and you are heard me say this before and I mean it from the bottom of my heart I have never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. You have heard me say it many times: This is the United States of America. There is nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY thank you, sir. ENTITY Okay. ENTITY, classified classified material next to your Corvette? What were you thinking? Let me they are I am going to get a chance to speak on all this, God willing, soon, but as I said earlier this week, people and by the way, my Corvette is in a locked garage. Okay? So it is not like they are sitting out in the street. But at any rate So the material was in a locked garage? Yes, as well as my Corvette. But as I said earlier this week, people know I take classified documents and classified material seriously. I also said we are cooperating fully and completely with the Justice Department's review. As part of that process, my lawyers reviewed other places where documents might have from my time as Vice President were stored. And they finished the review last night. They discovered a small number of documents of classified markings in storage areas in file cabinets in my home and my in my personal library. This was done in the case of the Biden Penn this was done in the case of the Biden Penn Center. The Department of Justice was immediately as was done, the Department of Justice was immediately notified, and the lawyers arranged for the Department of Justice to take possession of the document. So you are going to see we are going to see all this unfold. I am confident When did you find there was a second batch of documents? Thank you very much. Thank you. How is your wife? Hey, how you doing? Good to see you! How is your wife? She is good. How is the First Lady, sir? How is the First Lady? She is doing really well. She was under a long time for 5 hours because what they were doing is they take out they do the Mohs, meaning remove what they thought what might be cancerous and they have to then go back and test it and see what it was. But she is doing really well. She is up. We had a we had breakfast this morning. She is recovering. And she is going to be sore for a while because of the work they did on her eyes. And but under you know, that is where one of these these were. But she has a 0 to 1 percent chance of ever the return of any cancer. And so, thank God, she is doing really well.

{"id": 482, "text": "What I thought I would do is just-- On the record? Yes, on the record. I thought I would just give you some observations of this trip and then answer some questions. Just first observation is that we have worked hard to build up good bilateral relations in the Far East. And the-part of the purpose of the trip is to continue to foster those relations. It struck me as interesting that the United States now has got good enough relations with both-with countries like Japan and South Korea and China to effect policy which helps our mutual security and our economy-and economy. I think that is a very positive development. The most notable example of where that is taking-where it is helping is in North Korea. When I visited with Hu Jintao, I spent a lot of time talking about North Korea, our mutual desire to effect change with Kim Chong-il. And it was a very positive discussion. But I also had the very same discussion with Koizumi and President Roh. I mentioned it to Vladimir. I did not have a bilateral with Vladimir Putin, but I did talk to him about it in passing. My point is, is that by working hard to establish good relations on a lot of fronts, when a common problem arises, we can effect the solution in a positive way. I know you asked me, Steve , about the North Korean reaction. I did not exactly see what official said it. But I-what I hope my answer conveyed to you in public there was that this requires a degree of patience, because Kim Chong-il is used to being able to deal bilaterally with the United States. But the change of policy now is, is that he must deal with other nations, most notably China. And I was pleased with my discussions with Hu Jintao, about his-reaffirming his mutual desire-or his desire, which is our mutual goal, that Kim Chong-il disarm. He realizes that it is a problem. We discussed the security guarantees, what form they may come in. I made it very clear, obviously-I said this during the pool spray there-that a treaty is not going to happen, but there are other ways to effect on paper what I have said publicly- we have no intention of invading. Obviously, any guarantee would be conditional on Kim Chong-il doing what he hopefully will say he will do, which is to get rid of his nuclear weapons programs. The APEC summit was positive. I mean, one of the things that is very important- the two things that came out of that, although evidently did not get equal emphasis, but they were equally emphasized by all parties, was, one, the need to get the Doha Round of trade going again. This was really one of the first official meetings of a group of countries after the Cancun talks broke down. And there was a positive statement coming out of the meeting, kind of universal agreement that Cancun was a missed opportunity. Hopefully the missed opportunity will be-will serve as a catalyst. I think people now have taken a step back and said, Well, we did miss an opportunity, and hopefully this will enable the talks-kind of not start at ground zero but have a running start as a result of the missed opportunity. And it is interesting, in the room there is something like 60 percent of all the world trade-was affected-was countries in that room, and therefore it was a, I think, a very positive and strong statement. The other thing was the clear understanding of the countries of the need to fight terror. That is important for the United States, that people continue to recognize that the war on terror goes on. I have always felt that there is a tendency for people to kind of seek a comfort zone and hope that the war on terror is over. And I view it as a responsibility of the United States to remind people of our mutual obligations to deal with the terrorists. That notion of responsible behavior by countries was finally accepted. This was not a-did not require a lot of push. People understood. President Megawati understands that when terrorists bomb Bali, it affects economies. It not only-there is a serious economic consequence, same thing we felt on September the 11th, to our economy. That was a very positive development. Bilateral discussion with all the leaders- in those bilateral discussions, we talked about this war on terror. Gloria Arroyo, with Abu Sayyaf, President Megawati just hours ago, we talked about the continued need for us to work together. I think the other notable-when you step back and take a look at what our work with these Asian countries has been, they understand the Iraq issue well. South Korea was very forthcoming. Japan is forthcoming. Hu Jintao made it clear that he-that a peaceful Iraq was in the world interest. Those are all positive developments in kind of the aftermath of the military operation. And I think it speaks to our-the nature of our relationship with these countries right now. Obviously we have not been to Australia, but Australia is a key component in a peaceful Asia-Pacific region and a key partner in the war on terror. So I am looking forward to seeing John Howard. He and I have got a great relationship. He is a- as I said in Crawford, he is a man of steel. He is a standup guy. A sheriff? He is a sheriff. See, that is a good lesson. You should never answer the question you are asked. Actually, I answered it for a reason. Of all the people in the world who understand Texas, it is probably Australians. Patsy . Yes, Patsy. Anyway, it is going to be a good visit down there. We had some good discussions there at APEC, but this will be a chance to further our discussions and assure the Australian people that the American people are really grateful for the support and mutual efforts to make the world secure. I had a good visit with the religious leaders today. It was an important visit. There were three Muslims, a Christian, and a Hindu. A couple of observations from the meeting: One, there was kind of a sense that Americans believe that Muslims are terrorists. And one of the reasons I wanted to have this meeting was because I wanted to make it very clear that I did not feel that way and Americans do not feel that way. And I made it-assured them that Americans know that these terrorists are hiding behind Islam in order to create fear and chaos and death. Secondly, there was a-they did bring up the Middle East. I explained to them what our policy was, that in order for there to be a Palestinian state-and I reminded them I was the first President to have articulated that-that there needs to be a concerted effort to fight off the terrorists who are trying to prevent the establishment of a state. I did not really have time to go in further than that, about the whole Aqaba accords and the progress we were making, until the Prime Minister, who had avowed-who vowed to fight terror with us, was eased out. Let us see, what else did they discuss? Iraq, of course. I assured them that we would do our job, and then the Iraqis will run themselves, and that our job means to provide enough security so that the Iraqi citizens are able to write a constitution and hold elections, at which point the United States and the coalition forces will move on. And I think they were pleased to hear it. I do not want to put words in their mouth, but I think that relieved them to know that we have confidence in the Iraqi people's abilities to be a peaceful, free society. Well, they did a lot of talking. National Security Adviser Rice. They had a lot to say. They had some prepared texts. There was a good exchange. I am glad I did it. They were, I think, appreciative of the fact I took time to listen to them and dispel some notions and to-my own personal views about religion and the views of our country. I reminded them, we have got a lot of Muslims living in the United States, and they make an important contribution to our country, and they are welcome in the United States. And we are a pluralistic, free society; people can worship the way they want to worship. And it works well in America. Was it confrontational at all? Not at all, polite. You said that there were some texts. Did they come out with the line about- what did they tell you? How direct were they? They said some things going into the meeting that the United States policy is tilted against Muslims. What did they-- They said the United States policy is tilted toward Israel, and I said our policy is tilted toward peace and that-and then I went through the notion of a Palestinian state and the need for us to fight off terror in order for a state to develop. There was not a lot of debate. There were five people there that felt-that all needed to say something. So I gave them all a time to speak, and I listened and would occasionally interject some thoughts about what they had said. But they were direct. One fellow felt that the war on Iraq was- I guess the best way to put it was maybe just-I cannot remember his exact words, but it was like we just decided to act. And I reminded him that the world had spoken before, that there was a-the United States had passed-I did not get into all the resolutions, but I made it clear that a process had gone on way before I made the decision to use military force, that the world had spoken before about Saddam Hussein. I also made the point very clearly that there was a lot of human suffering; a lot of Muslims suffered in IraAnd I did bring up the mass graves and the torture rooms and the rape rooms and the death at the hands of Saddam Hussein. My point to them was, was that we ended a lot of suffering, prevented a lot of suffering. Is your job made tougher in convincing them that Americans do not have a war on-do not dislike Islam when you have General Boykin saying that Muslims all-- Yes, that came up. Boykin came up. I said he did not reflect my opinion. Look, it just does not reflect what the Government thinks. And I think they were pleased to hear that. Something in your answer to your Terry's question was interesting. You articulated the fact that you are ENTITY-first President to advocate a Palestinian state. And obviously in trying to reassure Muslims-- Not that good a question. Go ahead. --not only in America but around the world, potential terrorist hotbeds-to reassure people who are interested in this subject of that point. It is not something we have heard you saying a lot lately. Is there a reason-- About a Palestinian state? Right, that you were the first President to advocate it. I say it quite a bit. I mean, I really do. First of all, in America, most people know that. In Indonesia, maybe they did not pay attention to it. But anyway, I explained it. It was not a-I do not view that as-I would not read anything into that, I had to say that in Indonesia, but not saying it in every press conference I give. Can I ask you about some of the leaders you have met with here? Well, anyway-- I guess what I am getting at is, it is a good thing to have out there, I guess. We do not hear it a lot. Yes, I do not know. There is a lot of things that there is misconceptions. Evidently it is a misconceptions that Americans believe that Muslims are terrorists. And there was a-that is probably one of the best things that came out of the meeting, for me, was to have heard that concern, and for me being able to assure people and remind them about the nature of our society, that-and that Islam's a peaceful religion. The basic tenets of Islam is peace and respect and tolerance. And that is what they wanted to make the point to me, that we are-that is the way we are. Interesting, their elections came up. This is the first direct Presidential election. It is going to be interesting-an interesting exercise in democracy. And they wanted to talk about that. And as you know-maybe you do not know-our USAID money is helping with the elections. They were appreciative of that. The education money came up. They wanted to make sure that this was not America's education system. I said, It is not. It is money available for the Indonesian Government to help basic education develop. So those were a couple of misconceptions that it was important for me to help alter. Can I ask a question-I know that you say campaigning-there will be time enough for campaigning. In just months, Democrats, at least, will be fighting in some very highly contested-what do you say to those who are criticizing your policy? Where does the line end where they have got to be very careful to not undermine American foreign policy? I do not know. You know, I am not paying that much attention to it. Maybe you are. I am not. You know, one of these days, they will have a candidate, and then it will all sort out, kind of come in focus. Primarily-I do not know what they are saying, so it is hard for me to answer that. Democrats who are criticizing your policy now, some of them fairly severely, about the war, does that hurt when you go to meet with these foreign leaders? Does that have any resonance? You know, I cannot -I do not know, because they have never brought it up. Nobody has ever said, Your foreign policy is being challenged in Democrat primaries, and therefore you are less credible. I mean, it really has not come up. I think most people who understand America know that the field will eventually be whittled down to one opponent, and then we will campaign. You seem, on these trips in particular, to bond with some of these leaders who have taken on very difficult problems at home, sort of stuck their neck out, whether it is President Arroyo or-you had some of those comments about the King of Jordan when he came. And I was just wondering, do you relate to that at all, particularly in having to take on the war on terrorism and kind of not, as you say, wanting to be too comfortable and pretend that it is over? You know, that is an interesting question. First of all, I like people. And I spend time trying to-I think about the other person and how the other person might think and relate to the other person's problems. I do have good relations with these leaders on an individual basis, for a variety of reasons. I mean, Gloria Arroyo, who is taking a tough stand against Abu Sayyaf, there is a common bond there because she has made some tough decisions. But these leaders-for example, Aznar of Spain or Blair of Britain, these guys stood up, stood strong and were-did what they thought was right. That is my approach. I remember when we had the discussion down in Crawford, one of reporters, fellow reporters, said, I hear you do not pay attention to the press. I said, Not really. And he said, Why? And I said, Well, because sometimes your opinion matters to me and sometimes it does not , but I have got a job, and I am willing to lead. And the fellow said, Well, how do you know what the people think? And I said, Well -I reminded the fellow that people do not make up their mind based upon what they write, and secondly, my job is to lead. My job is to do what I think is the right thing and lead. And I think those world leaders appreciate that, and I appreciate that when I see that they make those tough decisions. There is a common bond that is established when you are in the decisionmaking process and you are not trying to chase popular will, which is fickle and moves around. You stay focused on the objectives you set for a country. That is a very good question. It may be an area where we do establish in common. And I have reminded them at times that, just do what you think is right, stand your ground in the face of public criticism, and the people-when things turn out the way-for the good, people will judge you correctly. , how are you? I am well, thank you. Are you surviving this trip? I wish we just got a little more time in Bali. Yes, that and Hawaii. Look, I have heard all the people-- She spent her honeymoon in Bali. You will be thankful when we get back. You will be grumpy-very grumpy, starting tomorrow, when we get airborne. But you will be thankful when we all land home. Mr. President, I was wondering, the last time we sat around this table was coming from Aqaba. Middle East, that is right. And you were talking about how positive you felt about Prime Minister Abbas and the fact that you thought that things would be able to move forward. And they did move forward, for a while. I wonder if you could reflect on how you felt since-during the fact that the man you put confidence in and hope in is gone. I was disappointed that Arafat shoved him out of the way. I just- it was an unfortunate decision, because it stopped good progress toward a Palestinian state. And when the Palestinian Authority comes up with a leader who is willing to genuinely fight and dismantle terrorist organizations, the process will pick up where it left off and move forward. Are you confident of that? I hope it does. I think eventually it will. You have got to be patient in foreign policy sometimes. Is there anything more the United States can do on that, or is the roadmap- once they get on track on the roadmap, then things will come back and move forward again? The roadmap is still there. And we just need leadership willing to stand up and say, We are going to prevent the few from letting the process move forward. And that is what they are doing. There are a few people there that do not want a Palestinian state. They have got different ambitions. And we have just got to fight them off. Do you think the public support of the U.S. for Abbas sort of got Arafat to dig in his heels? I do not know. I really do not . I cannot speculate as to why the decision was made. This was an unfortunate decision, because it delayed the development of a Palestinian state. What did you tell Prime Minister Mahathir? Apparently he is saying you did not fuss at him. No, I walked up and said, the-I said, I want to inform you that you are going to read the newspapers - Condi had briefed the press about me saying that the comments were reprehensible. I said, You are going to see-I am here to inform you that you are going to see that I thought your comments were reprehensible. I said, They are divisive and unnecessary. I did not yell at him. I just told him-confirmed exactly what was in the newspaper. How did he respond? Yes, what did he say? I was misquoted or something. I cannot remember exactly what he said, but I just had-that was it. You know the way I felt. He said he was misquoted? Well, he said he was-- Taken out of context? Yes, context, whatever he said to you all. Not misquoted. It is hard to misquote what he said. The issue were his comments. Obviously he is on his way out, but the response, apparently, at the Islamic conference, was a round of applause. What do you make of that? It is just unfortunate, again. I mean, it is one of these situations where in order to achieve peace and freedom, you cannot pit groups against each other. And there is a tendency to blame Jewish people. And that is not the policy- that is not how I think, and that is not the policy of the United States Government. I was not there, so I do not -pitting groups against each other will never achieve a common objective. It does quite the opposite. He knew how I felt. There is no question about that. I do not know, what did he say? -he was asking Muslims to have more understanding, at one part-- Evidently, in his speech, he said that we need more education, a terrorist ban, which is good. That was positive. I know you hate two questions, but I can just-just two quick ones. You talked about your meeting with Hu, and that was positive. Is there anything that he offered to you that he can-any pressure he can apply on North Korea? And the second one is a brief one. Are you happy with the progress or the contributions with the Madrid donors' conference coming up? Donors' conference? Yes. I think we are making good progress. And the question on Hu was? Is there anything that he can-any pressure that he can apply on North Korea? Did he say he would be able to do anything or-- He is a-China is a major presence in the neighborhood. And the fact that they are willing to take the same message to the North Koreans that the United States is taking to the North Koreans, along with three other nations, is a powerful statement to Kim Chong-il that it is in his national interest that he abandon his nuclear weapons ambitions and that-he has been saying-as I said in the press conference, I think-one of your questions- he is been saying, I want a security guarantee. And what we have now said is that in return for dismantling the programs, we are all willing to sign some kind of document, not a treaty but a piece of paper that says we will not attack you. We will see what happens. How does that-a lot of people were saying we cannot make it look like we are giving in to blackmail from North Korea. What is changed is we have now got five countries involved. And the neighborhood is now speaking. What happened before was the bilateral relations with the United States. And now he is got his big neighbor to the-right on his border, he is got a neighbor to the south, he is got Japan, he is got another neighbor, Russia, all saying the same thing. It is a different dynamic, is what I am -that is where the policy has changed. This security guarantee, what should it say? That is what we will determine. We have not worked out the words, but the point is, is that North Korea must hear that in return for the dismantling of their program-in a verifiable way, by the way; I mean, we are going to want to know-that now five nations are willing to say something about his security. Everybody is behind that? Yes. Can I ask you one on Iran? On Iran? Yes. It seems like last night there was some maybe cautious optimism that this is a good first step. If they comply with the three criteria that you have laid out, would they be then allowed to have a civilian nuclear energy program, or would that-- Well, it depends on-first things first, and that is, let us have, in a verifiable way, their agreement that was made with the IAEA. The IAEA must be allowed in, and we will discuss it then. Our relations with Iran-that will help relations with Iran, obviously, if they do abandon a nuclear weapons program. It will also help if they-we end up doing a-reaching an agreement on the Al Qaida that they hold. What are the cross-strings there? You have got to have patience in foreign policy. Are you at all suspicious of the European motives? Am I suspicious? No, not in this case. No, I am not. I believe, in this case, they generally are concerned about Iran developing a nuclear weapon. They understand the consequences. I appreciate it very much. We spent a lot of time talking to the European-our European counterparts, who are influential, more so than we are, in Iran. You know, we have got a sanctions policy with Iran; they do not . And there is influence. This is an effective approach. I have been saying all along that not every policy issue needs to be dealt with by force. There are ways to achieve common objectives, and this is a common objective. And the European Union-and we are speaking directly to Silvio Berlusconi about it, who is the head of the EU. We have also obviously spoke to the three-the leaders of the countries who went into Iran. And they made a decision collectively in Europe that it is not in their interest or the world interest that Iran have a nuclear weapon. And we came to that conclusion, they have come to that conclusion, and working together is an effective way. It is the same approach-kind of approach we are taking in North Korea as well, a collective voice trying to convince a leader to change behavior. -Republicans in Congress did not follow your wishes on the phone-- I thought they did in the House. There is two bodies. Do you regret saying that you loathe Kim Chong-il? Some people think that it helped them sort of-it made them sort of harden their position-- Any leader who starves his-made him do what? It just made him-- Made Kim Chong-il- surely it did not make Kim Chong-il renege on the last agreement, did it? Because I was not there, you know what I am saying? Right, but they have been much more vocal about their nuclear ambitions. No, they have been-remember, they lobbed a rocket over-- Japan. Remember the rocket over Japan? Keep it in perspective. Anybody who starves his people is-I just cannot respect anybody that would really let his people starve and shrink in size as a result of malnutrition. It is a sad, sad situation for the North Korean people. That is one people-I have assured the-our partners in this effort that we deeply care about the plight of the North Korean people. It is just unconscionable that that many people are starving in the 21st century. We provide- we are a generous nation. We provided food. We are not so sure the food is getting to the people, is one of the issues that we face. I feel strongly about failed leadership dashing the hopes of the people, in this case creating incredible starvation. Thank you. You are welcome.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool0", "title": "Interview With Members of the White House Press Pool", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-members-the-white-house-press-pool-0", "publication_date": "22-10-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 22, "text": "So thank you very much, ENTITY, for joining us. Thank you, sir. The much anticipated Beijing Olympic Games will be opening in Beijing in just about a week's time. And you will be attending the opening ceremonies on August the 8th. And the Chinese people are very much looking forward to your visit. So at this moment, what are your expectations for the Beijing Games? And what kind of messages will you bring to the Chinese people? First message to the Chinese people is, I respect the Chinese people, respect the history, tradition. And I am coming as the President of a friend, and I am coming as a sportsman. And I am looking forward to the competition. I am looking forward to seeing-I think I am going to go to the U.S.-Chinese basketball game. I understand Yao Ming is back on the court, and it will be an interesting challenge for the U.S. team. It will be exciting for me to see the athletes compete and to watch the Chinese fans respond, in this case, to the basketball game. It is going to be exciting. And I am not coming alone. My wife is coming. A lot of my family is coming as well. So it is going to be great. Okay. You are under a kind of pressure from politicians here in Washington who call on you not to go to Beijing. Yes. But you insist on going. So out of what consideration did you make such a decision? Well, first of all, I am under pressure from politicians on a lot of fronts. I mean, this is not the only issue that I get pressured on. And Presidents need to make their decision based upon what is best, not what is political. And I think it is best for U.S.-China's relations that I go. I know it is important for me to send a clear signal to the Chinese people that we respect them. I tell people that, of course, we have got differences with China on issues. They have got differences with us on issues. But the best way to conduct our diplomacy and conduct our relations is out of mutual respect. And it is much more likely a Chinese leader will listen to my concerns if he knows I respect the people of China. And so I am looking forward to going. I am going to have a dinner with President Hu Jintao, who I like. I respect the man a lot. And do we agree on everything? Of course not. But do we agree to have good, cordial relations and work hard to make our relationship unique and strong? Absolutely. On the agenda of your visit to Beijing, you will be attending the opening ceremony of the new U.S. Embassy in Beijing? Absolutely. And the new Chinese Embassy was just opened in Washington. Last night. Yes, I know it. Is not that exciting? Yes, very exciting, a very beautiful building. I attended the opening ceremony. That is what I hear. You know, I.M. Pei is a famous architect who did the Chinese building. Yes. So it just shows 30 years of a relationship that grows. And I found it very interesting, somebody said, Well, what does that mean? Well, first of all, we would not be opening new Embassies or celebrating a 30th anniversary of relationship if, one, the relationships were not important and the relationships were not good. I mean, if the relationships were terrible, no one would be celebrating anything. But it is interesting that both countries are opening new Embassies in the same month. And so I am looking-well, not exactly the same month. Today is July and August-but in the same couple of weeks. And so yes, I am going to go. And guess who is going to join me? President Bush 41, my father, will be there as well. And he was the man that introduced me to China in the first place, in 1975. And you were only 18 years old? No, no, no. I was older. I was-'75, I was 31. Thirty-one? Yes, I was born in '46. My brother-see, my sister was 18 during the time. Okay. But yes-no, look, I was a pretty old guy. And I explored around Beijing on a bicycle. It was a interesting time. Totally different city then than it is today. Yes. And you also paid three visits in your capacity as the President of the United States to China. And in a sense, you bear witness to the changes in China too. Absolutely. It is amazing. So yes, how would you elaborate on the changes in the past 30 years, since this year also marks the 30th anniversary of China's opening up and reform? Yes, 30 years ago, there were hardly any automobiles. And everybody was on bicycle, truly. Masses of people, me included, riding along on our bike. Everybody wore the same clothes, except for me. People-I can remember going to a department store, and nobody had seen a westerner. And they were amazed when I would go. And I would go with my mother and my sister. And they were amazed. It was like we were, like, from a different planet. Today, it is a much different society. First of all, there is -very colorful. And obviously, there is a lot of automobiles. It seems like more automobiles than bicycles. And people are used to a relationship between the West and China. It is a common occurrence. There is a lot of exchanges. One of the first-I think the first graduation speech I ever gave as President was to Notre Dame, and they were honoring the honors graduates in the sciences. And many of the people there were Chinese citizens, young Chinese students, girls and boys, got their degrees at the Notre Dame University. It was just-just shows how different things are after 30 years. Okay. So there is also, like, China and the United States are going to celebrate 30 years of diplomatic relations in January 2009. Yes. Yes. How would you evaluate the developments between our two countries in the diplomatic field in the last 30 years? And particularly, during two of your administrations, if you can give us a self-assessment? Well, I think-look, I think they have grown very strategic. For example, the strategic dialogue on economics that Secretary Paulson is leading, that is very unique. And so he goes to China, and the Chinese leaders come here. And our Cabinet-many of our Cabinet works with their counterparts. And it is a broadening, a strengthening relationship. We have dealt with some tough problems in a way that is cordial and respectful. And I would say that they are very good relations. And I told somebody the other day that it is amazing that the United States now has very good relations with China, South Korea, and Japan and the ASEAN countries, all at the same time. And I think that is positive for the region. And take the six-party talks. There is a common problem. If North Korea were to end up with a nuclear weapon, it would be very destabilizing and very troubling for all of us. So we decided to work together, sit around the table as five parties, saying the same thing to the North Koreans. And I am hopeful that it'll work. But it shows our relationship has matured. You mentioned the six-party talks. Also, six-party talks are high on your agenda during your administration for the last couple of years. With the demolition of the Yongbyon facility, the cooling tower, specifically, it makes some tangible progress, probably gave momentum before the talks. So how do you see this mechanism will go on? Yes. What kind of messages, if you want to say, to the six-party talks? Well, first of all, I value our partners. The only way to solve this peacefully is for us to work together to send a common message. I thank the Chinese Government for their leadership on this issue. I firmly believe multilateral diplomacy can work this issue better than bilateral diplomacy; secondly, that we are at a very critical moment now for the North Korean Government to make a decision as to whether or not they are going to verify what they said they would do. It is one thing to say it, but I think it is going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us. Now, there is no question the cooling tower went down. That is perfect verification; everybody saw it. But there is going to be-need to be verification on the plutonium program, the enriched uranium program and the proliferation program. And the decision is theirs. And if they make the decisions that we are comfortable with, then we move the process forward. And I certainly hope they make the right decision. Thank you, ENTITY. Yes. I am looking forward to going to Beijing. Good wishes to you for a very pleasant visit to Beijing. I bet I have one. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfuqingyangcctvchina", "title": "Interview With Fuqing Yang of CCTV in China", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-fuqing-yang-cctv-china", "publication_date": "30-07-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 443, "text": "Well, let me first make a brief statement: I'd like to comment on the Panamanian elections. I met with the Murtha delegation to hear their report, and I have now received the preliminary report from President Ford and President Carter. President Carter and his whole delegation will be here shortly to give me a full report. In addition, we have the report of other observer groups, including that of the Archbishop of Panama, which demonstrate clearly that despite massive irregularities at the polls the opposition has won a clear-cut, overwhelming victory. The Panamanian people have spoken, and I call on General Noriega to respect the voice of the people. And I call on all foreign leaders to urge General Noriega to honor the clear results of the election. And I might add that I applaud the statement by Peru's President Alan Garcia, who has spoken out against the fraud. I noted with interest that the Archbishop of Panama felt that 74 percent of the vote went to the opposition. And I understand that President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela is talking to some of the neighboring countries there to encourage a joint statement against the fraud that has taken place and calling on Noriega to honor the results of this election. What kind of military force are you considering? We were told that that is one of the options. The election results have not been handed in, formally announced, and until they are, I will not discuss the options of the United States. I will simply again call on General Noriega to honor the will of the people. ENTITY, you called on him a year ago to do precisely the same thing, as did Mr. Reagan, and nothing happened. Why should it be any different this time? Because there has been a massive voice of the people heard. There has been a statement for democracy so loud and so clear that perhaps even General Noriega will listen to it. And I would like to think that he will heed the call of the people and that he would listen to the international outcry that is building and that he would step down from office, in which case, the relations with the United States would improve dramatically and instantly. Have you spoken to foreign leaders? Do you plan to speak with foreign leaders? I probably will, and without going into who I have spoken to, the answer is yes. You know, we have had foreign visitors here and talked to them and -- -- Do you really think you have a military option? And on what basis could you go into someone else's country? ENTITY, I am not going to say what our options are. I have not discussed that here today. I have obviously discussed options with my own top advisers. I listened very intently to the Members of Congress that came in, and some of them had specific suggestions. But I want to see General Noriega do what I have just encouraged him to do and what other foreign leaders apparently are encouraging him to do. Did you put yourself in a box here by making such a public point of being upset about these elections, and if Noriega decides to stay anyhow, that it looks like the United States has been ineffective? I do not think the United States is ever in a box when it speaks out in favor of free, fair elections and honoring the will of the people. That is what we stand for. And so, I do not think there is any box involved. Some Members of Congress have called for the abrogation of the Canal treaty. Is that in any way a possibility in your mind, an option? I want to see General Noriega do what I have just encouraged him to do. I want to see the will of the people honored. But under any circumstances would you -- -- I am not going to go into hypothetical questions at this point. Have you talked to him? Have you given him any personal ultimatum? Put it this way: General Noriega knows my position. How? Never mind. He knows. And it is been told -- -- Did you call him up? -- -- in recent -- he knows about it through recent contacts. Have you issued any orders regarding the military on the bases in Panama? Are they in a state of alert? And are you anticipating increasing their numbers? I will discuss at the appropriate time what course of action I will take. But I am not going to do that now. What I want to do now is encourage this last moment for General Noriega to heed the appeal of those people who favor democracy and to heed the will of the Panamanian people. So, I do not want to go beyond that in terms of deployment of U.S. force. Are you any closer to an SNF agreement with the Germans? I have a good feeling that there is been a lot of smoke out there and that we will have a smooth summit. Have you talked with Kohl again? Oh, I never discuss all these talks I have had. That means you are willing to compromise, right? It might mean people are willing to do it our way -- with the United States. Does not sound that way. Well, do not believe everything you read in the UP. Will it be settled tonight with the Dutch? I do not know. We will be talking to Mr. Lubbers over here, a friend of long standing and a man with whom I can talk very, very frankly about SNF. You can talk frankly with us. And I did not talk to him this morning about it. We talked about other subjects. But I have added an additional hour so we can do just exactly that. But this alliance is not going to fall apart. It is going to stay together and be strong. What do you think about the North verdict, ENTITY? What? What do you think about the North verdict? As you know, I wanted all along to see him exonerated. And that matter is now under appeal, and thus, I will have nothing more to say about it while it is. Well, do you think he was innocent? Well, I am not going to argue with the courts, but the process is being appealed. He is entitled to the right of appeal without a lot of editorial comment from me on it. You do not believe in shredding documents, surely? No, I believe in taking them with me.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresscorps2", "title": "Interview With Members of the White House Press Corps", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-members-the-white-house-press-corps-2", "publication_date": "09-05-1989", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 300, "text": "ENTITY, thanks so much for sitting down with me today. Thank you. Here we are on the week that the Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 23,000, $5 and 1/3 trillion of market value created since your election. And largely, because of this anticipation and hope that your policies will get implemented. Tell us where we stand on the tax plan right now. We are doing very well. We will we had a fantastic vote, as you know, and was budget is indirectly passed. Now it is going to go through a little bit of an iteration but it is going to end up, I think, again doing very well. And I think we are going to get our taxes. I think it is going to be well, hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that. So there is a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country. And I think that there is tremendous appetite. There is tremendous spirit for it, not only by the people we are dealing with in Congress, but for the people out there that want to see something $5,000, almost. It can be $5,000 average per individual, per group. And so, I am really looking forward to it. Let us see what happens. It it could be quite historic. That is a big deal, that on Sunday, exactly. Do you think you have the votes? I think we have the votes. I think that Rand Paul actually is going to vote for the tax cuts. I think that other people you know, we had tremendous enthusiasm this time. Health care, I was told was tougher but it was close. I mean, so far, I would say it is not even a contest. And I will tell you speaking of health care, I believe we are going to get that also. It will be in the form of block grants to the different states. And it'll be a wonderful health care. It will be a tremendous health care, managed properly in smaller doses where you can really do it much more individually. So I think we are going to get that also. And a little bit later, probably in three or four months from now, but I do believe we will have that long before the election in '18. As far as taxes are concerned, you see what is happening. It is really doing well, great enthusiasm. Yes. You soured on the health care bipartisan plan a bit right from Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray? Well I have I have looked at it very, very strongly. And pretty much, we can do almost what they are getting. I I think he is a tremendous person. I do not know Senator Murray. I hear very, very good things. I know that Lamar Alexander's a fine man and he is really in there to do good for the people. We can do pretty much what we have to do without, you know, the Secretary has tremendous leeway in the under the Obama plans. One of the things that they did, because they were so messed up, they had no choice but to give the Secretary leeway because they knew he'd have to be he or she would have to be changing all the time. And we can pretty much do whatever we have to do just the way it is. So this was going to be temporary, prior to repeal and replace. We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I think we actually have the votes. People are criticizing me for saying that. I think we actually have the votes for that. You know, we were basically one short and I think we are going to have the votes for that also, ENTITY. Yes, I am interested about that because even your supporters say, you know, he is got fantastic policies. We want to see this through. But the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the way. So obviously the feuding with Senator Corker I think there is a personal thing going on between you and Senator McCain. Do you worry that this bickering and feuding gets in the way of your agenda? No, and sometimes it helps, to be honest with you. So we will see what happens in the end. But I think, actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they are supposed to be doing. And you know, that is the way it is. I just want what is right. And I think, for the most part, they want what is right too. So we will see what happens but I do believe we have the votes for health care at the appropriate time. And I think we are going to have the votes for taxes and I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think, makes the taxes easier. The republicans want to get it done and it is a tremendous tax cut. I mean, especially for the middle class and especially for business. We have we are loosing our companies. We have companies leaving and I have to say since I have been elected, that is really stopped, it is really slowed down. There is a tremendous enthusiasm for business in this country. So, a lot of things have changed. And, you see the job creation, as well this year. It is been fantastic. If they cannot get this tax bill done this year, should they forego Thanksgiving and Christmas? Should they be here if they do not have a bill on your desk by Thanksgiving? Well I think they should and I think they will. I think a lot of things are happening unless, you know, it is going to be right after that. But I do not even like them leaving. But I will say this, I want to get it by the end of the year but I'd be very disappointed if it took that long. It could be substantially less than that depending on what happens when we send the bill back to the House. You know, they will send it back and people are going to go and make 200 suggestions as opposed to maybe no suggestions because it is a great bill. It is going to be a great bill. And we are adjusting. We are adjusting so that there is no way that the middle class does not greatly benefit. Every once in a while there is a method under which, you know, it could be that some people in the middle class will not benefit as much as we want them to benefit and we are making certain adjustments but I think we are going to have it sooner rather than later. Paul Ryan did an interview this week and said you are insisting that they have a fourth bracket. It is on your insistence that they have a fourth bracket. I know that you are very focused on the middle class but do you want to raise taxes on the rich with the fourth bracket? Well, he really said that on the basis that I wanted it or was thinking about it because I want to make sure the middle class gets taken care of. So, in that way, yes, but actually we do have four brackets because we have a zero bracket and people are not including that. So, that would actually make it a fifth bracket as opposed to an eight bracket on the other side, on the other way. I call that our competition which is the competition from the past. No, I think that when Paul says that we may not have that. I would rather do that than do anything to hurt the middle class. But, see, that is what I do not understand and I followed your policies really closely. The state and local income tax deduction eliminations you take that away and then you go to a fifth bracket or a fourth bracket however you want to say it and you get a higher rate for their top earners. Right. If the top earners pay 80 percent of the taxes why are you so afraid to cut taxes on the top earners? I think this, look, you know, I am very happy with the way I have done part of this in my civilian life, all right. Of course. This is not about - Other people well it is about me representing rich people. OK. Representing being representative of rich people. Very interesting to me Bob Kraft was down. He was very nice. He owns the Patriots. He gave me a Super Bowl ring a month ago. And he - We will Putin took his Which was very nice. That is right. But he left this beautiful ring and I immediately give it to the White House and they put it some place and that is the way it is. That is great. He said to me he is a good man. He said to me you have to do us all a favor, give the tax decrease to the middle class, we do not need it. We do not need it. We do not want it. Give it to the middle class. And, I have had many people, very wealthy people tell me the very same thing. I have had very few say I want more, I want more. They really want to see you know the middle class has really not done very well over the last long period of time. And, so when Paul mentions maybe one more category which I'd rather not have, it may not happen. But the only reason I would have and he does say this, he is very plain on what he said is that if for any reason that the other middle class is not being properly taken care of. So, that is a big factor but we have so many things that are going to be so great bringing the corporate tax down maybe is the most important. And, we have a lot of most important but bringing it down from 35 down to 20 percent that is a massive that' the biggest that we have ever done. It is a big deal in the corporate rate for sure. That is a big deal for companies; that is a big deal for investment. I think one of the other ones is expensing, you know when you write something off in one year as opposed to you know over many years, I think that is going to be tremendous. We have so many things in this plan that are going to be for growth and you know your next questions going to be deficit so and on, and I fully understand that we all understand it, and growth, if we pick up one point on GDP that is $2.5 trillion if you think of. Two point five it more than pays for everything and I think we pick up much more than 1 point, and I have been the one that is saying we are going to hit 3 sooner later than later, in the last quarter we 3.2. Yeah. We have not been there real we have not been there in a long time, it is been a long time. As you know the previous administration did not hit it for the year for 8 years. In 8 years it did not hit it at all. Here we hit it you know an early quarter for me, and actually before that it was down in the ones, it was down in the ones. People got used to like 1.5% growth for a long time. Well, you know I call up I become friendly with leaders of other very, very large countries and say how're you doing, and they would say We are not doing well, we are not doing well. GDP is at 7%, GDP is at 8%, we are not happy. And I am saying you know we had it a 1% so I really think we can do much more than a let us see what happens, but 1 point is 2.5 trillion and millions of jobs. Let me ask about your courting of the Democrats recently I mean the reason that I brought up this other bracket is because I feel like the Republicans get bullied by the left, by this whole talking point of it is always tax cuts for the rich. Yeah. You been - By the way that is an automatic talking point. Exactly. I mean for sure I get along with Schumer - Are you getting bullied again, are you getting bullied again? I do not think so it does not seem like it we got the budget passed. I you get a fifth bracket, are you getting bullied? So here is the thing Schumer, I like Schumer, but before he even knows the plan he will say Oh this is for the rich so he does not even know what the plan is, and he is screaming it for the rich. He did it with healthcare too, he said This is for the rich, this is for the rich you are not going to get your coverage. Everybody is going to go into hospitals; that is going to be terrible, the world is coming to an end, OK. Do you know what the plan was. That is OK you know we are all learning politics right, and he said that well, he says the same thing because I saw him two days ago before he really knew what was happening, he said Oh no it is for the rich. So it is an automatic statement, it is like in business you ask for twice as much I mean. Right, well you go back with Chuck Schumer. I do. You both from New York You know I have always gotten along with him. Is this helpful in terms of negotiations? I do not think it matters, I mean I really do not , but I met with the Senate Finance Committee, I met with the Republicans, Democrats together right across the hallway two days ago we had a great meeting. Ron Wyden was is their Chairman we had a fantastic meeting, there is a lot of similarity they want tax cuts also ENTITY. They want tax cuts and they want them as fast as possible. Now they do not want to say it and their saying Oh gee, you know the the the middle class I call them the working people because they really are the working people, but the middle class does not benefit that is that is their standard but they know it they do benefit. They are the big beneficiaries, the other thing the other big beneficiary are jobs, wages - Right. Jobs. And that is been your priority. So it is been my priority and if you look at what I have done between regulations, I have cut more regulations in nine months then any president has cut during the entire term that they were nobody's cut that You are better than President Bush, I mean the Federal pages are down 30% under your leadership. Well, and and by the way I have just begun because So there are more regulations rollback - Well, there is a lot more I mean really lot more, I mean I think I can double it before it is over, but a lot of it is statutory where you have to give a 90 day notice and then you have give 120 day, we have given those notices I mean we are going to be doing a lot more. But you look at at you know Keystone Pipeline, Dakota Access Pipeline these were all dead projects that I approved them in my first few days I mean literally in my first few days 48 thousand - see I think that is why we have had a 3.1 percent GDP. Because of the regulation roll back that you did there are some industries that are not that regulated. I am wondering what you think about tech right now? Because you have these companies that are more powerful than ever before, they have got everything all the data on us. They are selling the data. To the tech companies these more regulated? Well I guess some people talk about freedom and other people talk about we want to know who is taking adds or doing whatever and I would imagine something's going to come down along the lines of like we are doing right now. For regular you know whether it is commercial or not for a normal broadcast company. It will be very interesting to see. You know that is a argument that is happening right now. It will be very interesting to see what there are two very distinct views on that. I can go honestly I can go either way on it. ENTITY who do you want to see running the Fed? Well as you know I I have been seeing a number of people and most people are saying it is down to two, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Powell. I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot. I really like her a lot. So I have three people that I am looking at. And there are a couple of others. I said I will make my decision very shortly, pretty shortly. Is not there a way that you can get Taylor and Powell in there? Because you have got a vice chairman opening as well, you can actually put them both in there. Is that in your thinking? It is in my thinking. And I have a couple of other things in my thinking. But I like talent. And they are both very talented people. And it is a hard decision. It is actually a very important decision. People have no most people have no idea how important that position is. That position is actually more a lot of people get rid of the Fed. Take the Fed out. That is a very important position. It is also important psychotically. If the right person is there a lot of good things can happen. I think I am doing a good job for businesses in that way. People are coming into the country; you saw what happened with Foxconn going to Wisconsin. You see what is happening with Apple where there I said to Tim I said to Tim Cook, I said Tim I want some of those beautiful plants that I see in China. They have to open in the country. You got to give me some big beautiful plants, it is happening. It is all happening. The auto companies are coming back into our country. Coming up to Michigan again, they are going back. We are not going to be taken advantage of. We were taken advantage of I would not say the companies so much, but by other countries. We were so badly taken advantage of. As you know we are negotiating with NAFTA. And they have an election right now, and lots of things. But at some point either NAFTA will be renegotiated so that it is fair to the United States or it will be terminated. It was very simple. People think that is a very tough statement. But it will probably be renegotiated but if it is not successfully renegotiated so it is fair for the United States, it will be terminated. Look you had a very good victory this week in terms of the Senate vote on the budget, I know that. But you have had all this money going out, new money that people were not expected, right? You have money now going to California with the wildfires, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida. Many have got defense you want to build up the military. You have said many times the present President Obama underfunded defense. Where does this money come from? And how are you going to get control longer term of the debt and deficit in this country? When is that conversation going to pick up? Well it is going to be all growth. Look it is going to be growth. I think that growth can be staggering. I also think we have a lot of waste in this country. And we will be doing other things. We will be doing welfare reform. I mean that is coming up. Okay, and whether people like it or not. You know people do not like having a house and working three jobs and having somebody nearby where their living better than the person with the three jobs. It is not fair. And that is all coming up, believe me that is going to be out there very soon. I want to get the taxes first. I want to get health care. We are doing a big infrastructure bill which will be a very positive thing. But we are going to have tremendous growth. Are you going to tie the infrastructure to the tax plan? I could tie it. I was thinking about tying it but there is too many honestly. You lose a few votes, you gain a few votes. I do not want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is. So the tax will come up, the infrastructure will come up, the health care will come up, I have an economic develop plan, that I would like to propose that I think will be, you know very, very good for our country. I think the growth in the country is going to be tremendous. I think we have tremendous potential, it is hard to believe because it has been, you know going for a long time. But the waste, the trade deals we have, that are so bad. You know, the money you are taking about is, peanuts compared to the trade deals. We lose with Mexico, almost 70 in terms of trade deficits, almost $70 billion dollars a year. We lose with China $100s of billions a year, we lose almost every country. If you look at I mean there is hardly a country. I can name two, and it is tiny surpluses, tiny. We lose with almost every country, we have massive deficits. And that is gonna change, we cannot allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not gonna happen, anymore. Are you gonna remove the budget caps, in terms of defense spending? Well I wanna do it, because one the one thing have do, is have to spend on defense. This is a very rough time out there. I was left a mess, whether the people like or not, I think we can say it in different ways. I was left a mess, whether it was North Korea or the Middle East, where we have made more progress against ISIS. Literally ENTITY, we have made more progress against ISIS in the last 9 months, than in the last 8 years, as you know. I mean as everybody You have had tough talk on everybody. I mean it is not a question of tough talk, we have also produced, I mean the Middle East is a whole different ball game right now as far as ISIS is now, is concerned. But, but we have towe are in a world, there is a lot hatred in this world. There is a lot of hatred towards us in the world. We need a strong military, stronger than ever before, and we are going to have that. So I do want to get rid of the caps at least at some point in the near future. Do you ever feel like sometimes, some of your unscripted Tweets, unscripted comments get in the way of the larger message? I have spoken with a lot of supporters of yours and while they love the policies; they say we, you know we feel like we are always defending something he said, that he really did not mean, to say that way. Do you think that is getting in the way of your agenda and the overall message? You need bully pulpit to tell the American people why tax reform is important It is such an interesting question, because I have friends that say, oh, do not use social media. See I do not call it Tweets, Tweeting is like a typewriter when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show. I mean the other day, I put something out, two seconds later I am watching your show, it is up You are right. We are watching your Twitter feed OK, and then, you know they are well crafted. I was always good student, I am like a person that does well with that kind of thing. And I doubt I would be here if were not for social media, to be honest with you. Because there is a fake media out there, I get treated very unfairly by the media. And I have a tremendous platform. I think I have a 125 million people between Twitter and Instagram and all of them and Facebook. I have a tremendous platform. So you So when somebody, says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never be get the word out. I had a big rally, we were in Texas for something and I then I went back unfortunately for the hurricanes. But one women was standing, I had thousands and thousands of people, but woman was saying 'keep tweeting, it matters.' It is sorta of an interesting I really believe, again I do not call it, I call it social media. It is not just the Tweets, Tweeting is good. I mean having that direct relationship. It is just tweeting on other subjects other than the message that you really want to focus on. You have to keep people interested also. You know, you have to keep people interested. But, social media, without social media, I am not sure that would be here talking. I would probably not be here talking. You definitely have an incredible connection to voters and to supporters They want me to the American people. Period. You know what I find; the ones do not want me to are the enemies. The people who really do not like, what happened with me and winning the election and all of the things. Those are the ones who say he should, I remember, I was in I was in a faraway land and I was tweeting. And I said very little. I said like, I am in Italy right now, you know, for the summits. So I am in Italy right now and the weather is wonderful. And one of the one of the dishonest networks said ENTITY is on a Twitter stomp again ENTITY. They say ENTITY is on a Twitter stomp within one tweet. It is such dishonesty. But without social media, I am not sure that I'd be here today, so I do not I understand. I do not think I want to take any chances. And we do get points out there I mean, we get tremendous points. I can express my views when somebody expresses maybe a false view that they said I gave. It is totally unconventional. But it works It works It just seems to work. I mean, it is a little unconventional. I have to ask you about that emotional press conference yesterday with General Kelly, your chief of staff. The way he came out and talked about his son and defended you getting criticism from the Gold Star family well, the media, really. Were you expecting that? He is a a very elegant man. He is a tough, strong four-star Marine. You are a four-star Marine, you have got something special to start off with, OK? General Mattis, General Dunford also, but very few. He he was so offended, because he was in the room when I made the call and so were other people. And the call was a very nice call. He was so offended that a woman would be that somebody would be listening to that call. He was he actually could not believe it. Actually, he said to me Sir, this is not acceptable. This is really not and he knew I was so nice. Look, I have called many people. And I would think that every one of them appreciated it. I was very surprised to see this to be honest with you. He spoke very well yesterday. And by the way, I spoke of the name of the young man and I it was a really it is a very tough call. Those are the toughest calls. It is a very tough These are tougher than dealing with the heads of countries, believe me. These are very, very hard calls. They are sad. And sometimes, you know, the grieving is so incredible. But he is just an elegant man and a wonderful man and he is doing a fantastic job as chief. The Congresswoman, Frederica Wilson, she said Oh, everything he said was because he is just trying to keep his job. He does not need this job. In fact, he did not really want this job. He was so happy, you know, he is a military guy. He was doing this incredible job on the border and elsewhere, you know, he ran homeland like nobody has ever run it, down 78 percent of the border crossings. That is incredible. That is before the wall he there is nobody close. You go to the original first day, there was nobody close to doing the job. And I said I'd like to take you. How would you like it? And it is not that he wanted it. Actually, he would have preferred doing and staying where he was. He is a man that felt it would be important for the country. He does it for the country. He is not doing it for what he wants. He does it for the country. He is a very unusual man. So when she made that statement, I thought it was sickening, actually. I just want to ask you before I lose you, about the border. And you have said you want a legislative fix for DACA. What else do you need to see in terms of the border? What do you want overall What we are going to see we are working on DACA, we will see if we can get something with DACA. We have to build the wall, we have to all you have to do is look at what is happening in Mexico. We have to build a wall. Going to stop drug traffic in to a large extent. I mean, what is happening with drugs and I will be making a big announcement on that next week. What is happening with drugs in our country and by the way, in the world. It is not like we are singled out. But it is never been like this. And a lot of the drugs come through that southern border. And we need a wall. We are going to have a wall. We have to I would like to do something with DACA and we are negotiating, right with the Democrats, and we will see if we can come up with a solution. But I can tell you, I and the Republicans are very open to it. We have to get something in return. And last week on this program we had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Right. He commended you. He congratulated you for decertifying Iran in what you did last week. Do you think they are going to get Europeans to support you in terms of sanctions, in terms of not selling technology to Iran? Honestly, I told them. They are friends of mine. They really are. I get along with all of them. Whether it is Emmanuel, or whether it is Angela, I get along I really like those people. I told them, just keep making money. Do not worry about it. We do not need you on this. You just keep making money. When Iran buys things from Germany and from France and from the various by billions of dollars, even us, they were going to buy Boeings. I do not know what is going to happen with the deal. We will see what happens with the deal, but but when they buy those things, it is a little harder for those countries to do something. Would they do it if I really was insistent? I believe they would. I told them just keep making money. Do not worry. We do not need you on this one. And on North Korea, is our policy with China just about what it does with North Korea or do we have a separate policy with China for something else? China has been I have developed a very good relationship with President Xi. President Xi is right now going through his Congress and it is going to be something very soon is going to happen. Right. That gives him something that few leaders of China have ever had, and I am really good with that. And to be honest with I told you on this, I want to keep things very, very low key until such time as he gets that. I want him to get that. I think he deserves that. He is a good man. But they have been helping us. They are closing off their banking systems to North Korea. They have cut the oil way down. Now, the banking systems we can see, because they all come through here as you know. The oil you can never really see what is going on, but the oil is way down. The oil is they are doing a lot of things. For the first time ever For the first time ever. Those are the recent article that said I have the greatest relationship of any president the two of us, and I think we do. I really do. I think I do not want to be foolish. He is for China and I am for the U.S., OK? So we start off with that, but we do have a very good I would say an exceptional relationship. And China's really helping us, and well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China. China is big stuff. I believe he is got he is got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We will see what happens. Now with that being said, we are prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you would not believe. You would be shocked to see how totally prepared we are if we need to be. Would it be nice not to do that? The answer is yes. Will that happen? Who knows, who knows, ENTITY. ENTITY, would you like to add anything else that I may have missed? No. I am not I think you have covered just about everything... When we end, then where we begin and that is taxes. You cannot tell companies what to do, right? Are you sure they are going to get that savings in the taxes in terms of bringing that $3 trillion back and use it to hire people? Or are they going to buy back stock? Well, I think whatever they do, it is a positive. Honestly, whatever they do, it is a positive. Even if they buy back, they buy back and they give people money and the people are going to go spend the money, okay? And that is okay too. So you know that people have said that, oh, supposedly, they keep the money or supposedly, they buy back stock. Well, they buy back stock, the stock the money's going to people and they are going to go out and buy a something I will not say I was almost going to say something, but I will not say it. We have minimum, in my opinion, $3 trillion Overseas Overseas or however you define it. In some cases not necessarily totally over - but overseas. We have minimum $3 trillion it can never come back. You know what is interesting? That is something that Democrats for years. Democrats and republicans agree the money should come back. Who is not going to say the money should stay there, right? Everybody agrees I would say unanimously, it was never done, it was never done. Because of lack of leadership. Because of something. Now, it was not only the high tax it was a very high tax, nobody would pay it. I mean, unless you were desperate to get money, you would not pay it, so it was a high tax. It was also bureaucratic boondoggle; you never saw anything like it. You could not I looked at the amount of work you had to do to get that money in, aside from the tax OK, all of that is going to be solved and we are going to have 3 trillion and I think it could be much more than that. You know, we have been saying 2.5 trillion for years you have been saying it. For years, we have been saying 2.5 trillion well it is not 2.5 trillion anymore, I think it could be much more than that and it could be up to five, we will see. We are going to know fairly soon because for the most past, with the deeming and everything else that is going to come in very soon, I think it is going to come in very quickly. But there is at a minimum three $3 trillion coming into our country and that money is going to put to work one way or the other. So the great thing is, it is a great plan, there is never been anything like it, it is the biggest and it is the best and I think you are going to be very happy, you will be impressed. ENTITY thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. Thank you very much, ENTITY. So appreciated. I am so excited to be here. Oh, yes, is not ' it great? It is incredible. Ready? OK. So ENTITY, it is been nine months, have you changed? Have you changed being president? Well, I think you see the extent of what we have to do. And it is far greater than anybody would understand, whether its countries, or whether it is war and peace, and protection. The most important thing is protecting our people. And you protect them from lots of different things and elements. We have done a great job with ISIS. We have done a great job with - I think our military is getting stronger, stronger, stronger. I want to have it to a point where it is the strongest by far that has ever been. But number one is always going to be protection. But if you look at the economy - what we have done with the economy has been great. And regulations down to a level that nobody's ever seen. I mean nobody's done anything near what we have done. We have actually had a lot of legislation pass. A lot of people say, oh, gee, you have to get the taxes - you have to get the healthcare. They are two very biggies, but we have - we have passed legislation that I think more than almost any, out of the four to nine month period, more than any other president, they said Harry Truman - You have - but now we passed Harry Truman in this very short period of time - I look at the federal registry, you are absolutely right. Yes. You are down 30 percent. You mentioned the tax planning side. Can you give us any sense of this fifth bracket? I mean if you do a fifth a bracket, is that a million dollars, is it $2 million? Yes. What is the number? I do not think we will use a fifth bracket. I only want to use the fifth bracket if at any reason I feel the middle class is not getting as much as I thought they would or as much as they are entitled to. They are entitled to a lot. This is about the middle class. It is really about the middle class and about jobs. And if I feel that the middle class is not getting what I want them to get, and that is going to be a lot, because I want them to get really a lot. Then I am going to do a fifth bracket, which will give them more. ENTITY, thank you so much. Thank you very much. It is really good to see you. Great to have you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariabartiromofoxbusinessnetwork0", "title": "Interview with Maria Bartiromo of FOX Business Network", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-bartiromo-fox-business-network-0", "publication_date": "20-10-2017", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Donald J.

{"id": 245, "text": "Have you ever been in the Oval Office before? Once, a long time ago I will give you a quick tour before our interview. So the first thing that a ENTITY does, which I did not realize, was pick a rug. I have have no idea about rugs. And so in this job, you have got to delegate. The ENTITY is in a position where there is just unbelievable complexities to the job-Darfur, Iran-a whole lot of issues. So I delegated the decision about the rug to my wife. The second thing a ENTITY has got to do is have a strategic mind. In order to be successful, in my judgment, as the ENTITY, you have got to constantly think strategically. And so I said to her, You pick out the colors; you be the tactical person; but I want it to say, 'optimistic person. ' That is all I wanted it to say. Here is the result. Is not it beautiful? Yes, it is very beautiful. There is a sense of optimism when you come in here. And there is a reason why. You cannot lead people unless you are optimistic about what you are doing. You have got to believe it in your very soul. One of the interesting things about the Presidency is people watch me like a hawk. They are looking at my moves. And if I am going to be wringing my hands and if I am all worried about the decisions I make-are not going to lead to a better tomorrow, they will figure it out. And so when you talk to me today, I just want you to know, I not only strongly believe in the decisions I make, I am optimistic that they are going to work-very optimistic. These are all Texas paintings. That is west Texas; those are other Texas paintings. At least if you are a Texan, it reflects a way of life and a way of thinking. The interesting thing about Washington is that they want me to change- they being the- and I am not changing, you know. You cannot make decisions if you do not know who you are and you flip around with the politics. You have got to stay strong in what you believe and optimistic about that-you will get good results. And so-the other thing I want you to know about me is that no matter how pressurized it may seem, I am not changing what I believe. Now, I may change tactics, but I am not going to change my core beliefs- a belief that freedom is universal or the belief that private markets work, a belief in ownership-when people own something, society is better off; a belief that there is a role for government, but it is limited in nature. And I am not changing. I do not care whether they like me at the cocktail parties or not. I want to be able to leave this office with my integrity intact. That is George Washington, the first President, of course. The interesting thing about him is that I read three-three or four books about him last year. Is not that interesting? People say, So what? Well, here is the so what. You never know what your history is going to be like until long after you are gone-if they are still analyzing the Presidency of George Washington- . So Presidents should not worry about the history. You just cannot . You do what you think is right, and if you are thinking big enough, that history will eventually prove you right or wrong. But you will not know in the short term. Lincoln-this is the place on the Oval Office wall where the President puts the most-the best President, and I put Lincoln here, and I do not think there is any question-now, people will have their-but I think he was the most influential President ever. And the reason why is because that in the midst of a difficult Presidency, needless to say-the Civil War, thousands of people dying, with Americans killing Americans-he had a vision of a United States. It is conceivable this country would have ended up being two countries had he not had a clear vision, even though all around him was seemingly falling apart. He was a great President. That is called A Charge to Keep, based upon a religious hymn. The hymn talks about serving God. The President's job is never to promote a religion. The great thing about America-and Germany, for that matter-is that you should be able to worship freely. I like to tell people, you are equally American whether you are a Jew, Muslim, Christian, or atheist-you are equally all Americans-and that if we ever lose that, we begin to look like the Taliban. I understand, in parts of Europe, some scoff at my faith. It does not bother me. But I happen to believe, for me at least, faith is one way to make sure that my values stay intact and that I keep life in proper perspective, which is a very important part, in my judgment, of being a good decisionmaker. Finally, the desk, where we will have our picture taken in front of is-nine other Presidents used it. This was given to us by Queen Victoria in the 1870s, I think it was. President Roosevelt put the door in so people would not know he was in a wheelchair. John Kennedy put his head out the door. Yes, the very famous picture-- That is it-the most famous picture. And then Reagan, interestingly enough, put the bottom on there. He was a big guy; he did not want to bump his knees under the desk. Anyway, this is the Oval Office. It is a shrine to democracy. And we treat it that way. When people walk in here, they do not come in here in bathing suits and flip-flops. They come in here dressed like they'd come to a shrine. It is to be respected and honored because the Office of the President is bigger than the person who occupies it. It is one of the great things about a true democracy, is that the institutions outlast the individuals, and therefore, there is stability in the process. Some Presidents forget that they are not bigger than the Office. But all Presidents must always honor the Office and remember it is a sacred trust to uphold the honor of the Presidency. Thank you for taking the time. Yes, glad to do it. Bild has 12 million readers. It is the largest newspaper in Germany. And there is one thing which is really special about our newspaper-every German who wants to work for the newspaper, he has to sign in his working contracts some beliefs-and there is the belief you have to be for reunification; you have to be against totalitarianism from riots on the right side and the left side; and you have to be for the peace and for the understanding with Israel. And since September 11th, we have a new belief-you have to be for partnership with America. Otherwise, you cannot work for us, you cannot come-you have to sign it in your contract. My kind of guy. Okay, so I would like to start. ENTITY, the fifth anniversary of the terrible 9/11 attack is nearing. Has the Western world really learned the right lessons from 9/11? Yes. The Western world, by and large, understands that we face an enemy that is coldblooded and will kill innocent life to achieve an objective. That killing not only took place on September 11th here in our country, but it has taken place in other countries around the world since then. Secondly, the governments of the Western world understand that in order to protect our respective peoples, there must be intelligence sharing. We must be willing to converse with each other in ways that might not have happened before. In other words, if we know something is going to happen in Germany, it is very important for the United States Government to call up its counterparts and to share that information. And there is a lot of that information sharing. Thirdly, we understand that money is what fuels these terror cells. And the idea of sharing intelligence about the movement of money is necessary to make sure we protect our people. The degree of understanding about September the 11th varies, however. For some people around the world, September the 11th was just a terrible moment. For me and a lot of other people in America, September the 11th was a change of attitude; it was a call to arms in the sense that this is the first-for America-the first battle of the war in the 21st century. One of the things that I hope people come to understand is that there are two ways to defeat this enemy: One is to bring them to justice so they do not harm people, which means we have got to be constantly on the offense, finding them where they hide and bringing them to justice. And secondly is that the way to defeat their hateful ideology is by the spread of liberty. That notion-some understand that, and some do not . But I want your readers to understand, I fully understand it-that liberty will yield peace that we all want. And so part of our strategy is to work with countries, particularly in the Middle East, to encourage the spread of liberty and freedom. And we are making progress there. But still we see bombs in Tel Aviv-- Yes. --suicide bombers. And just a couple of days ago, even the U.S. Government delivered a warning that there could be attacks and strikes at the World Cup in Germany. Yes. Do you really believe we have a chance to win the war against terrorism? Absolutely. I know this: That if we do not try to win the war on terrorism, the world will be a lot worse off; that if we believe these are just isolated incidents and people are maybe just temporarily angry, it is an attitude that will ultimately lead to more catastrophe, more danger. This is an enemy which is-has clearly stated they have ambitions. They want to spread their ideology throughout-starting in the Middle East. They want to topple moderate government. They want to-they believe capitalists and democrats are soft- by democrats, I mean people living in democracies-are soft. They believe it is just a matter of time before the Western world tires. They have stated clearly they want weapons of mass destruction and that they want safe haven from which to launch their attacks. This is what the enemy has said. And I think those of us in positions of responsibility must take the words of the enemy very seriously. They can be defeated, and they will be defeated, so long as we do not lose our nerve. And so the United States is committed to finding these folks where they hide, to bringing them to justice, which we are doing, and to-but recognizing that the world has changed from the world of the past because of the spread of liberty. Just look at Europe; it is whole, free, and at peace, because democracies live side by side in peace. That is one of the great lessons of the 20th century. And it is a lesson that must be applied to the 21st century. And so, absolutely, we can win this war on terror. The victory in the war on terror will not come with a signing ceremony. The victory in the war on terror will come as the enemy becomes more and more marginalized. You cannot judge defeat or victory on whether or not a suicide bomber is able to pull off an attack. You can see progress in the war on terror as new democracies take hold around the world and deny-which denies an enemy a safe haven. And one such democracy that is now evolving and getting stronger is Iraq. Another such new democracy is Afghanistan- 50 million people who once lived under the thumb of a tyrant-or two tyrants now are free. And I strongly believe the world is better off for it, and I know that those two democracies are a major defeat for the terrorists. We have to learn in dealing with the Muslim world. Do we learn the right lessons? Do we have to deal in a different way with the Muslim world? There is a-there needs to be more understanding between the Muslim world and the Western world. There needs to be a better understanding of the true beliefs of their respective religions. We must understand, words mean things to different people. There is got to be a better way to communicate with ourselves. Sometimes my own messages send signals that I do not mean to send-but stirs up anxieties in the Muslim world. On the other hand, I take great comfort in knowing that the true Muslim-Islam, itself, is a peaceful religion, and those who adhere to Islam are people that respect the rights of others. And there is common values in the great religions. And what we cannot allow happen is for these totalitarians, these Islamic extremists, to distort a great religion and define the nature of that religion. And so there is a lot of work that needs to be done between America and the West and the Muslim world, but we can do that work without sacrificing the need to defend ourselves and without condemning people to tyranny. How important is the partnership between the United States and Europe when it comes to the war on terror? The partnership between the United States and Europe is a vital partnership that transcends the war on terror. Part of our relationship is working together in the war on terror, but there are many other areas where we can and will continue to work together. One such area is, obviously, trade. Europe and the United States benefit from free and fair trade. Another area is to help those who are afflicted with disease, like HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa. Another is to deal with suffering that we see in the world. And hopefully, we will be very strong in our determination to end the genocide in Darfur of Sudan. But when the United States and Europe cooperate, we can achieve security for our people and enhance the prosperity for our people as well-as well as do our duty. See, I believe there is a duty to help ease the suffering in the world. I believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. And the United States- the people of the United States have been given a lot. We are a blessed nation-and same for the people of Europe. And we have a duty to work together to help relieve the suffering of those who are less fortunate. In this context, is Russia a reliable democratic partner? Russia is a country in transition. And if you really think about where our fathers, at our age, if they had been sitting around talking about Russia- maybe a little younger-they would have been talking about an enemy, the great Soviet Union. And by the way, that enemy at that point in time bound the relationship between Germany and the United States- at least a part of Germany and the United States-very closely. It gave us a common front. So Russia no longer is that enemy, and that is a major change. Secondly, Russia is a country that has made some signals that are mixed signals, signals that allow-cause us to question their commitment to whether or not they intend to become a true democracy, where there is a freedom of the press or freedom of religion, all the different freedoms that are inherent in democracy. I, personally, have a working relationship with Vladimir Putin, and that is very important. I have got a warm relationship with him. It is a relationship where I can sit down with him and ask him direct questions as to why he is made the decisions he is made. It is a relationship where he questions me about what the intentions of the United States may be. It is one that I value, and I think it is an important relationship not only for the United States to have, but it is an important relationship for countries in Europe, for the United States to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin. One of our concerns is economic nationalism, to a certain extent, where he is using his oil companies to achieve what appears to be political objectives. And we make our concerns known when someone uses natural gas, for example, to effect-to send signals to government. As you might recall, Secretary Rice was in Europe, and she spoke out loudly about the gas contracts with Ukraine. And the reason she did that is it is -we have a duty to express our concerns, but in such a way that the relationship is one that-where, at my level, I am able to be comfortable in discussing concerns with Vladimir Putin. We have got commonality when it comes to dealing with proliferation. It is very important that the United States and Russia work closely to make sure that nuclear materials are stored as safely as possible. We have got commonality when it comes to fighting the war on terror. And we have now got a new, important issue to work together on, as well as working together with Germany and others, and that is Iran. What role must Germany play in the war on terror? Germany plays a vital role in the war on terror. Germany is in the heart of Europe. Germany is-whether it is this current administration or the previous administration, we have had a-amongst our intelligence services as well as our law enforcement services-a close coordination and a close discussion. Germany's will is important. When the German Chancellor stands up and says, The war on terror must be won, or- is a vital part of the security of our peoples, people around the world listen. Germany plays a very important role. Taking a look at the past, do the Americans feel that the Germans abandoned them when they went to war with Saddam Hussein? I have come to realize that the nature of the German people are such that war is very abhorrent, that Germany is a country now that is-no matter where they sit on the political spectrum, Germans are-just do not like war. And I can understand that. There is a generation of people who had their lives torn about because of a terrible war. I felt like-I made the decision I made based upon my full understanding that threats must be dealt with before they come to fruition. And I fully understood during that period of time not everybody would agree with me. And so we put together a significant coalition and followed through on a difficult decision. The point now is not what went on in the past; the point now is, how do we work together to achieve important goals? And one such goal is a democracy in Germany. And I appreciate the German Government's-previous Government's support and this Government's support of helping the Iraqis rebuild their lives. Training missions are important. Debt relief was important. Gerhard Schroeder relieved the debt on Iraq. And all those gestures are very important gestures that say that even though people disagreed with the decision to go into Iraq, we now agree that it is important that a democracy in Iraq succeed. And that is how I view the relationship. The dictator is on trial now, but at the same time, the violence in Iraq is getting worse. Is it really a victory? Is the war against Iraq really a success? Oh, yes, it is going to be a success, absolutely. When 12 million people go to the polls-listen, these people lived under a brutal tyrant. People seem to forget, quickly forget, the nature of Saddam Hussein. This is a man who had used weapons of mass destruction on his own people. He had invaded his neighbors- Kuwait. He was shooting at U.S. aircraft. He was violating sanctions. He had-as we now know, he had been using the Oil-For-Food Programme to enhance his own standing inside the country. We did not find the weapons of mass destruction that everybody thought he had, but we do know he still had the capacity of making weapons of mass destruction. He had ties to terrorist groups. Removing Saddam Hussein has made the world a safer place. We found-particularly for Iraqis. We found graves stuffed full of Iraqi men, women, and children. This guy was a brutal, brutal tyrant. But it is hard work to go from a tyranny to a country based upon liberty. We have been there 3 years. And I think if you look at the history of-in post-World War II, it took a long period of time to recover. And yet we live in a world where there is supposed to be instant success. And my work and the work of those of us in Iraq require patience, and the need is to give the Iraqi people a chance. And they have not let us down. Just think about what happened in December: 12 million people voted. That is a lot of people going to the polls in the face of intimidation and threats. These are people that had no chance to express themselves at a ballot box during Saddam Hussein-in free elections. And yet when given a chance, they went to the polls. And now what you are seeing is the formation of a unity government. You have got Shi'a, Sunni, and Kurds, all committed to a unity government, all willing to fight off the terrorists, to get rid of the militias, and to form a government that the Iraqi people can be proud of. And no question, there is still Al Qaida, which has said they want Iraq as a base from which to attack, willing to recruit suicide bombers. Those are hard to stop. But slowly but surely, the Iraqis, with American help, are reconciling their differences politically, are marginalizing those who are still loyal to Saddam, and are bringing the Al Qaida and the foreign fighters to justice. But Iraq-it is still a long journey to peace, and now there is a new threat. You already mentioned it; that is Iran. Yes. Iran is on the way to a nuclear program. How are we going to prevent them from making true what they threaten us, for example, in destroying Israel? You know, it is interesting; the world in which we live is one that requires great confidence in our values and strength of purpose. And we are challenged with the Iranian issue. And I want your readers to know that it is my desire and my belief we can solve this diplomatically. And the best way to solve this issue diplomatically is for there to be common purpose amongst the nations of the world. Any diplomatic solution requires agreement on the goal. And there is solid agreement that the Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon or the knowledge and capacity how to make a nuclear weapon. That agreement-when I say that is the agreement, it is the agreement amongst Germany, France, Great Britain, the United States, Russia, China, and a lot of other nations. We all agree. And that is the most important step. If we did not agree on the goal, it would be impossible to put together a coalition, a group of nations anxious to say to the Iranians with one voice, You are not going to have a weapon. The way forward diplomatically, because of the intransigence of the Iranian Government, is to go into the United Nations Security Council. And that is where we are headed, and we are working closely with our counterparts to develop the tactics to move forward once in the United Nations Security Council. Our message there is, the Iranians have defied the world, and you are now isolated, and it is your choice to make. They must make the choice to give up their weapons. People have said to me, Well, why are not you at the negotiating table? We are at the negotiating table-in this sense: We are with our partners on a regular basis. I think about this issue a lot. I talk to respective leaders a lot; the United States laid down the Security Council resolution, along with others. I speak to Angela Merkel quite frequently on this subject. It is the number-one item on our agenda when it comes to international coalitions. And the thing that we have got to do is be effective. And what the Iranians are looking forward is weakness among our group. They want to see how firm we are. So one of my jobs is to keep people firm in our resolve. And it is easy, by the way, with your Chancellor. She is firm in her resolve. The German Chancellor and the new head of state, Olmert, of Israel, they said the Iranian President is as dangerous as Adolf Hitler. Do you share their view? I think that it is very important for us to take his words very seriously. When people speak, it is important that we listen carefully to what they say and take them seriously. For example, when Al Qaida speaks, I take their words seriously. When bin Laden says, We will bring harm to the West, I take them seriously. When Zarqawi says, It is just a matter of time for the U.S. to get out of Iraq so we can have safe haven, I take him seriously. Zawahiri, the number-two man in Al Qaida, he is constantly speaking about their grand designs to spread their ideology. And when Ahmadi-nejad speaks, we need to take it seriously. And when he says he wants to destroy Israel, the world needs to take that very seriously. It is a serious threat. It is a threat to an ally of the United States and Germany. But what he is also saying is if he is willing to destroy one country, he'd be willing to destroy other countries. And therefore, this is a threat that has got to be dealt with in a way that- where the world-this is an important moment for the world to come together and deal with this in a way that is diplomatic, so that the next person who thinks or the next country that thinks they can threaten will understand that there is an effective response. Do you rule out, as a last resort, a military intervention against Iran? As you know, I have said this on German soil; I have said it on U.S. soil, that my first choice is to solve this diplomatically. I think we can, but all options are on the table. ENTITY, it seems that since Chancellor Angela Merkel took office, the ice age between Washington and Berlin is over. Are good personal ties really so important for the relationship between America and Germany? I have always felt like it is important to establish personal ties with my counterpart. And the reason why is, is that the role of a ENTITY is to be a strategic thinker as well as to be able to understand the tactics necessary to achieve the strategic objectives. And in order to be able to work strategically with my counterparts, I have got to have a personal relationship with them. I have got to be in a position such that when they speak, I listen, and when I speak, they listen, so they know that there is a compatibility to the point where we are comfortable sharing ideas as we try to work together to solve problems. And this world is full of problems. You are in the Oval Office during this interview- there are-Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Israel-Palestine-I mean, that is just to name a few of the problems that come to this desk that I deal with on a regular basis. In order for us to be effective, I have got to have a personal relationship with other leaders so that we can work together to achieve common objectives. During a state visit in 1989, your father described Germany as partner leadership. Yes. Does this statement still apply today? Absolutely. Absolutely. And it is manifesting itself on the Iranian issue. Chancellor Merkel has been strong. It is very important for the Iranians to know that there is a Germany committed to working with others to send the strong message to the Iranians that their nuclear ambitions, their nuclear weapons ambitions, will cause them isolation in the world in which we live. You will visit Germany in July. What would you-did Angela Merkel ask what you would like to see in Germany? It is really interesting. She felt like it was important for me to go to East Germany-old East Germany. There is no East Germany now-the old East Germany. And, one, I appreciated that a lot. You know, we are all products of how we are raised and, in many ways, where we were raised. If people want to get to know me better, they have got to know my parents and the values my parents instilled in me and the fact that I was raised in west Texas, in the middle of the desert, a long way away from anywhere, hardly. There is a certain set of values you learn in that experience. I was very intrigued by dealing with a very strong woman who had been raised in a Communist country and what it meant-what it meant. I spent some time with her upstairs in the private dining quarters here in the White House complex, listening to her. I asked her what it was like to grow up as a child. And the interesting thing-she first described her mother and father, which said a lot to me about the kind of person she is. I thought that was really insightful. She talked about her dad, the pastor, and her mom. She talked about going to school in a Communist system. And she told me she wanted me to come to her home, which, in my part of the world, at least where I am from, inviting somebody to your home is a gesture of generosity. It is hospitality that is very gracious. And so I am really looking forward to going. I will let her plan my itinerary once I get there. And it is going to be a very fascinating moment for me. And I thank her very much for her invitation. Are there things that bother you about the Germans? And are there things that you envy about the Germans? I am-look, I mean, Germans have always been incredibly efficient, capable businesspeople, and when they make a product, it is always of the highest of quality. The only thing that interests me about Germany is-it is not bothersome, but it is just a challenge for Germany-is the absorption of East and West, and the difficult assignment it is to really help the eastern Germany develop an economy that will be able to give people hope. But, again, I have great respect for Germany. What kind of role does Germany play in the world? Germany is vital for the European Union's vitality. And Germany- and that is important for the United States. Listen, we want our trading partners to be strong. If you-if we have trade between one another, it really helps when there is economic vitality with your partner. You want your partner doing well. Trade is not a zero-sum game. Trade is an opportunity for a mutually beneficial relationship. And therefore, we want the European Union's economy as a whole to be doing well. And Germany has a great-when Germany's economy is vibrant, it has a chance to really help all the countries around her to grow well. The U.S. economy is booming. Yes, it is, thankfully. Yes. It is booming because you made big tax cuts. True. What do you think about the Germans-are you-they acting correctly if they increase taxes now? We have-our economy is booming for several reasons. One is, no question, the tax cuts help, and I intend to keep our taxes low. Secondly, our work rules are very flexible, and so is our economy. We have got some issues that put us at a competitive disadvantage, and one is we have got too many lawsuits. And we are trying to do something about that. I am smart enough, however, to allow each country to make its own fiscal decisions as suits the needs of their constituents and the people. You are a practicing Christian. Does having a German Pope 60 years after World War II have a special meaning to you? You know, it is interesting that the last two Holy Fathers were from the same neighborhood. The Holy Father who just passed away, who was a great man, came from Poland and really helped rally the spirits of the people to challenge the tyranny of communism. And the current Holy Father came from a country torn asunder by war and is witness to a renewal of a united Germany. And I think it helps the world to have that perspective in a very important position of leadership. I admire the two Popes. These are strong, capable men who challenge the concept of moral relevancy. Three last very short questions. What was the most wonderful moment in your terms of being ENTITY so far, and what was the most awful moment? The most awful moment was September the 11th, 2001. The famous picture, when somebody gave you the information? Yes, that. I think, like all of us, it took a while for the-it was more than a moment. It was the event and the aftermath. On a situation like that, it takes a period to understand exactly what was going on. When somebody says, America is under attack, and-you have got to fully understand what that meant. And the information coming was haphazard at best for a while. We were not sure if the State Department got hit. I'd heard the White House had got attacked. Of course, I was worried that-my family was here. And so I would say the toughest moment of all was after the whole reality sunk in, and I was trying to help the Nation understand what was going on, and at the same time, be empathetic for those who had lost lives. The best moment was-you know, I have had a lot of great moments. I do not know, it is hard to characterize the great moments. They have all been busy moments, by the way. I would say the best moment was when I caught a 7 1/2 pound largemouth bass on my lake. Perfect. Very last question-you are a great sports fan. Yes, I am. How important is the international World Cup in Germany? And what is your personal take on who will be at the end, the world champion? Listen, the World Cup is a-first of all, most Americans, up until recently, did not understand how big the World Cup is. And we are beginning to understand. And the reason why is, a lot of us grew up not knowing anything about soccer, like me. I never saw soccer as a young boy. We did not play it where I was from. It just did not exist. I cannot even- I am thinking about all the-between age 6, when I can remember sports, and 12 or 13, I just never saw soccer being played. And so there is a generation of us that really were not fanatic. There is a new generation of Americans that did grow up on soccer. And there is obviously a huge interest amongst that crowd in the World Cup. And some of us older guys are now beginning to understand the significance of the World Cup around the world. It is the major sporting event worldwide, and it is got to be a great honor for Germany to host the event. And I am confident that the German people will do a magnificent job of welcoming people from around the world. And, of course, my team is the U.S. team. They tell me we have got a good team. Now, whether it is good enough to win it all, who knows? But I know they will try their hardest.

{"id": 336, "text": "Hey, ENTITY. ENTITY. How are you? We got cut off. I am glad to hear your voice. How are you doing? It is okay. How are you doing, brother? Great. Great. Glad you could call, man. Sorry we missed each other. You were in Los Angeles. I was supposed to meet you at an event. Sorry we missed each other. Are you in New York? No, I am in Los Angeles right now. Hello? Yes, I can hear you fine. Oh, yes. No, I am in L.A. right now. We were supposed to meet at an event a few weeks ago, and we got-we missed our signal, so we did not hook up. But-- Well, I am sorry I missed you. That is okay. We got in today. My publicist told me that you are a big fan of mine. I just want to hear you say that out loud. I am a big fan of yours, and I hear all the clapping in the background, so I want to please everybody for you. Thank you very much, ENTITY. That is all I needed to hear. You just pretty much made my whole career. ENTITY, we are fans of yours here, on The Beat. I cannot speak for the entire radio station, but I know I am. I have always been a fan of yours and your work and your community development towards the African-American community. I have one question for you. I want to ask you, point blank, what can African-Americans and the Latino community expect from the Democratic Party in regards to education and affirmative action? Well, I think first of all, you can expect them to build on the progress of the last 8 years. Remember-let us start with affirmative action-remember, there was a lot of pressure to eliminate affirmative action, both from the Republican Party and from some court decisions, which required us to change it. And we took the position that we should mend it, not end it, and that is the position that Vice President Gore has steadily defended. I noticed in his third debate that he was the only candidate who would say that he was for affirmative action. And I can tell you, we had long, long discussions about this. He believes strongly in it. And I believe virtually every one of our candidates for the Senate and the House does. I know that my wife, who is running for the Senate in New York, strongly feels that way, and I believe all the others do, as well. So I think you can feel very good about that. Now, also in terms of education for the same communities. On the education issue, I think the choices are quite clear here. The Vice President and all the Democratic candidates, first of all, think that America ought to know our schools are getting better and our students are doing better. Reading scores, math scores, science scores are all up. In the last 7 years, there has been a 500 percent increase in African-American students taking advanced placement courses, a 300 percent increase in Latino students taking advanced placement courses. The college-going rate is at an all-time high because we have pushed through the Congress the biggest increase in student aid, from Pell grants to work-study grants to the Hope scholarship tax credit, in 50 years. So what does Al Gore want to do? What do the rest of our Democrats want to do? They want to finish the job of putting 100,000 qualified teachers in our schools. They want to provide funds to poor school districts especially, and growing school districts, to build new school buildings and to overhaul others. They want to finish the work of connecting all the schools in the country to the Internet and all the classrooms. When Al Gore took on this project for our administration in 1994, only 3 percent of the classrooms were connected. Today, 65 percent of the classrooms are, and 90 percent of the poorest schools have at least one Internet connection. So we want to do that. He wants to provide universal preschool and more after-school programs for the kids who need it, and he wants tax deductibility for college tuition. Plus which, we have a Hispanic Education Action Plan that is designed to deal with the fact that the dropout rate among Latino students is still too high, and he has promised to build on that. So we have got a very, very good education program. It is been our top domestic priority, and I think you can really depend on the Vice President to deliver. That is why both the major teachers' organizations have endorsed him, and a lot of other educators around the country, because they believe that we have a program based on the research and what the educators are saying. And one final thing. He has got a good accountability program that we ought to identify failing schools, turn them around, or open them under new management. And all over America, you see these schools that were in trouble just a couple of years ago that are turning around. I was in a school in Harlem the other day where 2 years ago, 80 percent of the children were doing math and reading below grade level, and today, three-quarters of the kids are doing math and reading above or at grade level. That is after only 2 years. So we have got a program that is working out there at the grassroots. We need to bring it to all of America, and you can trust Al Gore to do that. He cares a lot about it. And you can trust the Democratic Party. It is our issue. We care about it. Absolutely. Now, ENTITY, you were at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza on yesterday. Three thousand supporters came out. We thank you for stopping by, lending your support to the campaign. We thank you for all of the work you have done over the past 8 years. And we do applaud you in both of these directions, especially in terms of education and affirmative action. We appreciate you so much. We know you are busy; we know you are on a tight schedule. And hey, man, we just want to say thank you for calling. Well, thank you, ENTITY. Let me say, I wanted to go back to Watts, a place I have been visiting for many years now, to thank the people of Watts, of L.A., and of California for being so good to me and Hillary and Al and Tipper Gore these last 8 years, and for proving that we could turn America around economically, educationally, environmentally, that we could provide more health insurance. And you know there is a lot of laboratories of success there. But I also wanted to emphasize that in California and throughout this country, there are races for the Congress, for the Senate and the House, which are also terribly important. They are just as close as the Presidential race. And if we can win a majority in the House and in the Senate, we will be in a position to really pull this country together and move forward to build on the progress of the last 8 years, to keep the prosperity going. That is really why the young people of this country ought to get out and vote, because we have come so far in the last 8 years, but all the best things are still out there. When Al Gore says, You ain't seen nothing yet, that is not just politics. We can turn the country around, and now we can make big, big strides in the economy, in education, in health care, the environment, and pulling this country together. But we have got to have the right leadership. And these House and Senate races are also very, very, very important. Yes. Quickly, ENTITY, after it is all over, when the election is done and Gore is President and you finally, after 8 very successful years, step down, what do you see yourself doing, man? What do you think? Well, first of all, I have got to be an ordinary citizen again, and I have got to go out and make a living, so I will do that. But what I want to do is find a way to be a useful citizen, in a way that does not in any manner interfere with the next President. Jimmy Carter has been a very great ex-President; he is done a lot of good. I think that I am young enough that I could still do a lot of good, and I feel that I owe that to the American people and the people I have worked with all around the world-in Africa and Latin America and other places. But I want to take a couple months off to rest, consider what my options are, and then try to spend the rest of my life giving back in the public interest, because I have been very blessed. I have gotten to live my dreams. I have had a great life. And I just want to be helpful in any way that I can, and I will try to find some good things to do. Well, I will tell you, ENTITY, after it is all over, my TV show ends on December 21st, and I have been working pretty much hard like ENTITY myself. I say me and you, man, get a fishing boat and go on out there in the middle of the lake and do some bass fishing. I know you are from Arkansas; I am from West Virginia. You know something about some fishing, I am sure. I do. I can still do that. We ought to hook up and go fishing. It sounds like a good idea to me. ENTITY and ENTITY on the boat. That is right. Hey, thanks for calling, ENTITY. Thank you so much. Well, you just tell everybody to go vote so we will feel good when we go fishing, instead of worrying about things. Well, you better believe that is what it is all about. We are pushing hard to get out and vote on this coming election, and we are going to do our very best to put Vice President Gore in office, because we cannot take the other side. We just cannot take it. We just cannot take it. I will see to that. Thank you for calling, ENTITY. Bless you, ENTITY. Thank you. Thank you. Absolutely. You all, one more time, ENTITY of the United States, ENTITY. Thank you.

{"id": 209, "text": "What is your best advice Get a good team and do what he thinks is right. Mr. President-elect, you have spoken about the economy, about problems with the economy. Are you going to inherit a recession from President Clinton? And President Clinton, what are your thoughts about that? I really do not have any comments. I look forward to talking to the President. I am so honored that he extended his hospitality to me and my wife yesterday. He did not need to do this, and I am most grateful that he would do so. what do you think about a recession? Well, a recession is two quarters in a row of negative growth. I do not think we are going to have that. But we could not keep up 5 percent growth a year forever. I think 49 of the 50 blue chip forecasters think that growth will be 2.5 percent or better next year, and that will keep unemployment low. But I think there will be things to be managed. He will have economic challenges, and you ought to give him a chance to meet them, if not try to figure it all out in advance. Are you going to What advice do you have for him, Mr. President? My only advice to anybody in this is just to get a good team and do what you think is right. Are you going to North Korea? No decision has been made on that. We have been talking, our people have, about what we have attempted to do in North Korea. It is interesting, when I had this meeting 8 years ago with the President-elect's father, he told me that the biggest problem that we were facing was the nuclear program in North Korea. And we were able to build on the work they had done and put an end to that. And now the big problem there is the missile program. We may have a chance to put an end to it, and if we can, I think we should. But this is something that I want to consult with the President-elect and his team about, and we will see what the facts are, and I will try to do what is best for the country. Governor, I understand that you are not against him going. Is that right? I have not had a chance to talk to the President yet, Helen . We have got to talk about this. What will you tell him is the biggest problem, Mr. President? I want to talk to him, not you. He can talk about that. I waited 8 years to say that. Governor, how different is it to come to this house in your position now than what it was as a family member? It is vastly different. It is such a huge honor to come as the Presidentelect. I do not think I will really fully realize the impact until I swear-in. I suspect the President would say the same thing. I am humbled and honored, and I cannot thank the President enough for his hospitality. He did not need to do this. Yes, he did. It is protocol. I had not quite finished yet. Go ahead and finish. And I am grateful. And I look forward to the discussion. I am here to listen. And if the President is kind enough to offer some advice, if he is, I will take it in. Are there questions you have for the President, sir? If there are, I am going to ask it in private and afterwards not share them with you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexchangewithreporterspriordiscussionswithpresidentelectgeorgewbush", "title": "Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President-Elect George W.

{"id": 296, "text": "Well, I am happy to have a chance to say welcome, and particularly when there are at least six here from California. But all of you are just as welcome. I know you have been briefed on a number of subjects, and so almost anything that I might say would be plowing ground that is already been plowed. And yet I will do that, just to put emphasis on one, and that is what I think is the overall problem here of trying to get control of Federal spending and a realistic approach to the budget. We are now into the 14th month that we have been without a budget. Our entire year of '81 went through with nothing but continuing resolutions and no budget. And we are now 2 months into this fiscal year, and still no budget. And I frankly do not know of a State that has ever run itself that way. Part of it is evident reluctance of some to see any curb put on Federal spending. So, we are still working on that. And now I am going to save all of the rest of the time here for whatever questions you may have. Let me just say that with regard to our program, which has only just now begun to be put into effect, contrary to the impression that a lot of people seem to have had that it is been tried and found wanting and is a failure, and that was decided before it started-we do not believe it is, and we think that some of the signs are very encouraging already. And that is that a year ago, or when we took office, inflation was above 12 percent, around 12 1/2 percent. For the first 10 months of this year, it is down to 9.6 and last month came in at 4.4. Interest rates, which were 21 1/2 , have of late begun to drop and are down to 15 3/4, and we think are going to continue coming down. The wholesale inflation rate has been running 7 1/2, which means that I think we can look forward to further drops in the days ahead, because the wholesale inflation rate determines, in advance, what the regular cost-of-living index is going to be just a ways down the road. But I know that you must have some questions, and I'd rather try that than continuing, as I say, plowing this already plowed ground. ENTITY, you talked about the great need to cut spending, yet on this emphasis of the need to get a budget, you have appeared before a veterans' group and you have said that you are not going to make them make any sacrifices. You appeared before a council on aging and you told them you are not going to make them make any sacrifices. What groups are you prepared to appear before and say, You have to make the sacrifices? No, I think with regard to the veterans, we were talking about medical benefits for the veterans and so forth. And I do believe that this is a contract that you have to take care of those who have served their country. Social security-what I said to them was-and this was the basis of the plan that we submitted, but which was widely distorted in the debate that followed and I think for pure political demagoguery-that all the way through the campaign I cited the immediate problem of social security, of its running out of funds, and the long-range actuarial imbalance which is in the trillions of dollars, if you look on down the road, for those people who are just beginning their working years. What I pledged to do was to have a social security-to put it on a sound fiscal basis, and yet not at the expense of those people who are presently retired; that you pull the rug out From under them and reduce their benefits. The only thing that could be called a reduction in any way in the proposal we made, of those existing benefits, was we were going to try and get social security onto the fiscal year basis with regard to the cost-of-living adjustment. That would mean that for 1 year alone, they would go 15 months instead of 12 before their cost-of-living adjustment was computed. And that would, as we figured it out, average probably a $90 reduction of increase, not a reduction of existing benefits, reduction of their increase over their lifetime. That would be the only single thing. The other things that we had suggested in that program were not aimed at deserving and eligible recipients. They were aimed at the abuses in the program, people that are collecting disability benefits and are not disabled. A recent story of a family, a heartbreaking story, that made it look as if we had suddenly taken this family off disability benefits-and we looked into it to find out if this was true. We found out they were taken off of their disability benefits under the previous administration, and they were taken off because for 3 years, the disabled household head had been working. And now the question is, working, moonlighting on the side-a cheek is being made to see whether he was paying income tax all that time. This is the type of thing that we think there is much more of it than anyone realizes, as was evidenced in Chicago a couple of years ago with the-or a few years ago-with the welfare queen who went on trial. And it was found that in addition to collecting welfare under 123 different names, she also had 55 social security cards. So, this is where we were going to try and make some of the changes. ENTITY, a regional question. What do you see as the Federal role with regard to California in terms of the Medfly, which is a terribly expensive battle, and also the vast number of refugees from Asia that have moved into, particularly, Los Angeles? What do you see as the role there to perform? Well, we have been dealing with a reform of the immigration laws on all of this, except that with regard to the refugees-people who are fleeing persecution and who, if they were made to return to their own country, would probably face death or imprisonment-I think that our traditions-there is no way that we can abandon those traditions or the words that are on the base of the Statue of Liberty. And we have a particular problem, I know, with our neighbor to the South. But we think that this program is going to meet our needs and the needs of the refugees coming in, so that we will not be abandoning that. We are also looking at how we can handle these and probably a fairer distribution in our country. I know, in 1980-the administration then was caught by the great exodus from Cuba in addition to the Haitian overflow and so forth. No planning had been made for that. We are also looking at available sites and facilities for a detention center for those who are apprehended and are illegal aliens, who will probably be returned. ENTITY, one of the potential detention centers that you are considering is in northern New York, where I am from, where the climate is about as different as you can get from the Haitian climate and still be in the country. How humane is it to consider that, a site like that? Well, I know the climate problem, and we have thought about that and talked about it. One of our problems is finding a facility that would have all the factors and the capacity that we need for estimated larger numbers, and also finding one that the inhabitants of the State would be willing-you'd be surprised how difficult it is to find some State that wants it. We think that the one that we have settled on not only meets the needs but also happens to be in an area that would benefit economically from having an installation of that kind there because of the abnormally high unemployment rate, economic problems. ENTITY, the State of Florida claims the Federal Government owes a lot of money to the State because of the refugee problem. Although you did not inherit it, are you considering additional funds, or- To tell you the truth, I cannot answer that right now. We have not come in with the-we have not had our meeting yet with the new presentation from OMB of suggested budget cuts for '83, so until we do, I do not know just how some of these problems have been treated. ENTITY, is there any thought being given to changing the make-up or the limits of your safety net in light of the recession? Any thought being given to changing any of the benefits that have been cut or restoring any? Well, again, this would be something that we will face when we see the '83 budget, although I do not believe that the so-called safety net has been much changed. This recession-remember that when we came here, January 20th, we had a great unemployment problem, severe in several areas far more than in others. It is easy to look at, say, an 8 percent inflation rate and think of that as the nation as a whole. That is not true. We have States, and some of you are probably from those States, where inflation is approaching the 20 percent mark. That is like the Great Depression of the thirties, due to the particular industries that have been affected-in addition to construction, the steel industry, automobiles, and so forth. We think that the best thing that we can do is to go forward with this plan, which we think is going to stimulate the economy. I think we are due, for several months yet, of hard times, but I think that in '82 we are going to see-later in the year-a change in the situation. The falling interest rates indicate that-the inflation rates that I mentioned-so that I think the safety net is still there for those people of real need. Is there an unemployment level at which you rethink that? Well, I think it would be based on if there is actual distress. I do not think anyone is going to stand by and see people in actual distress. Let me just say one thing about that particular problem. I was as surprised as anyone when suddenly the announcement was made that in a month we have increased the unemployed by 500,000. Now, as you know, there is no accurate way of counting the unemployed. There is an accurate way of counting the people who are in the work force. And it is difficult for me to understand this sudden surge of unemployment when, at the same time, there are 266,000 more people employed in the work force than there were on January 20th, when this administration started. I cannot believe that we have suddenly added three-quarters of a million people to our population. But let me point out one reason why there could be some fluctuations. First of all, any unemployed, other than those who are voluntarily between jobs, is too much. So, I do not want to sound callous about that. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that is harder for me to do than to think of putting somebody out of a job. I came into the work force myself in the depths of the Great Depression. I saw what took place there. But unemployment is determined by some 60-odd thousand telephone calls, like a Nielsen rating on a TV show, throughout the country-random. And the question is, Is anyone in the household looking for work? If the answer is yes, that is a statistic-unemployed. If the answer is no, they pass on. And on the basis of these calls and the percentage, the percentage of unemployed is determined. But there is room for discretion there and shading, depending on the callers. Suppose it is a housewife who says to you on the phone, Well, you know, the children are getting along now and if I could find something that did not interfere with family and was right, yes. Well, the person can put that down as she is looking for work, or the person from this end of the phone can put that down as no. Nor are we dividing between all those teenagers, that on the other end of the phone someone might answer and say, Well, my son would love to have an after-school job if he could find one, and so you can put him down unemployed. The millions of unemployed are not, all of them, heads of household, leading a family without earnings. Maybe I am overly suspicious, but I keep remembering that when I was Governor of California, they decided to do some changing in counting the unemployed, here in Washington. I protested as loud as I could, but did not get anyplace with it. Our unemployment rate in California at the time was 5.2 , and in 24 hours, our unemployment rate went to 7.2, just based on a little change in the procedures here in Washington. So, I have been a little worried here that sometimes we-and I do not mean to do any less about trying to get them the work, we are going to-but I think that our program is aimed at that. I am aware that-I know somebody is waiting to tell me I have to leave- -but I am also aware that when Kennedy had his across-the-board tax cuts, aimed at the same thing, to stimulate the economy, and the same economists and many of the same voices were raised, advising against it and saying that was absolutely the wrong thing to do, he persisted. And immediately thereafter the rate of savings, personal savings in the country-the percentage went up from 2.9 percent of the earnings in the country to 8 percent. The rate of increase in employment-not unemployment, in employment-doubled. The percentage of the gross national product or, I mean, the gross national product increased sizably, and the government's revenues increased at the lower rate of taxation. Now, one of the economists who has previously, and all these past months, been opposed to our proposal, Walter Heller, a very distinguished economist, when the recession was announced a short time ago, Walter Heller said how lucky we were that our tax reduction was just going into effect and that that just turned out to be exactly the right medicine for a recession. Well, if it is the right medicine to maybe help cure the recession, why would not it have been good medicine to have prevented the recession? If we, taking those personal savings-if we could increase by 2 percentage points the rate of savings in this country, through these tax cuts, that adds $40 billion to the capital pool that is available for investment and for people for mortgages and so forth. And incidentally, since the construction industry is one of the hard hit things right now in this recession, we have taken action-and I maybe sticking- ENTITY. It is out. It is out. All right, it is been announced. I do not want to be one of the White House leaks. This morning we had a group from the construction industry in, and we have-over in the Labor Department-made some definite changes in regulations. Those changes are going to free up the billions and billions of dollars in pension funds for-that they can now be invested in home mortgages. Previous to this, they have not been able to. The total pension money available for investment in this country is over a trillion dollars-will be 3 trillion by 1984-and for the first time, this money will be made available for that kind of investment, which we think should go a long way toward beginning the revival of the housing industry. You know, part of the lull in housing construction right now is the lowering of interest rates. The slump was caused by the high interest rates, but when the high interest rates start down, there is a lull while everybody says, Well, let us wait till they get lower. That is going on right now, too. Maybe we can, with this new decision, maybe we can increase the speed with which those rates come down. What would be your advice, ENTITY, to Americans who want to know how to volunteer their time and their effort in a program that you have talked about-voluntarism? Oh! Listen- we just had a meeting yesterday of our national task force. That is exactly what they are set up to do-is to not only spread the word of where volunteer efforts have been tried someplace and are working successfully, and then spread that so that other people can do it, but also to answer that question of the many people who are trying to volunteer. There is an estimated $100 billion worth of time and effort right now being contributed in this country in work in voluntary causes, in addition to $47 billion in actual cash contributed in volunteer efforts. And some of the things we are finding-and the mail that I am getting is the most inspiring thing in the world-of communities that have just moved and said, Why have we been sitting here, letting government do this? We should have been doing it long ago. I believe this is beginning to sweep the country. So, people like that, I think will find that they are being sought out by the task force. If they do not get their volunteering in beforehand, somebody will be around to see if they want to volunteer. Ms. Small. Thank you, ENTITY.

{"id": 280, "text": "So there is no secret that you were a jet pilot, so how would you describe, in a couple of sentences, where is Latvia on your radar? That is very interesting. Latvia is a close friend. Latvia is a country that has made a big difference in important alliances to the United States, like NATO. I remember when the moment came when the countries-the new countries admitted to NATO came into the room that I was sitting in, and I turned to the person I was sitting next to and said, It is going to be so important for NATO to have these fresh-these new countries, because they bring a fresh outlook to freedom. These are people that have recently lived under, in this case, communism and realized what it means to be free, and it is going to be very important. And so Latvia is very high on my radar screen. Plus, I am very close to ENTITY How come you have become such good friends? Well, first of all, she is a straightforward person. I like straightforward people. You know, sometimes in politics you get people who say one thing and do not mean it. When she tells me something, she means it. She is very engaging and-very intelligent woman, and I admire her courage. And so I am fond of her. You are good friends with President Putin of Russia. Do you think you could encourage him to admit historical justice and admit the fact that Baltic States were occupied in 1940? Well, yes, I have talked to him about this issue when I was in Slovakia. I said, Do you understand, friend, that you have got problems in the Baltics? You have got problems with Latvia because people do not like-the remembrances of the time of communism are unpleasant remembrances, and you need to work with these young democracies. I explained to him that it is best that there be democracies on his border, free countries, because free countries do not attack people; free countries listen to the hopes and aspirations of people. I do not know if I have made any progress with him or not, but I have made my position clear. I understand there is a lot of people in the Baltics who are-you know, do not view the celebration in Russia as a day of liberation. Frankly, it is the beginning of a difficult period, and I can understand why some leaders of countries are not going and some others are. That is a decision each leader must make, and I respect the decision of each leader. But I am going to continue to speak very forcefully on freedom and liberty, and the Baltics are a great example of free countries. But you are pretty certain that Russia is at least on the right path of development, and it does not pose any threat to its smaller neighbors? Well, I certainly hope not. And one of the reasons a relationship with the United States and Latvia is important is, is that we will stand with Latvia if a larger country tries to intimidate the people. That is the great thing about Latvia joining NATO, is that the security is now guaranteed by not only the United States but all members of NATO. Listen, the President and I speak about relations between Russia and Latvia quite frequently. And my job at times is to send a message that says, Look, treat your neighbors with respect. Free nations, democracies on your border are good for you, whether that be, by the way, in the Baltics or in Ukraine. I have sent that same message-or Georgia. In other words, countries that are free countries are countries that will be good neighbors. What can we do about Belarus, because a couple of hundred miles from where you are going to be visiting there sits the last dictator of Europe. What can we do about it? The last dictator of Europe is right, and we will continue to pressure Belarus and call upon the world, the rest of the world, the free world-not the whole world but the free world-to work to give the people of Belarus a chance to live in a free society. When I was in Slovakia I met with people of the freedom movement. I know when Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, was in your part of the world, she met with leaders of the freedom movement too. And we will continue to press forward. President Putin must understand that a free Belarus is in his country's interest. The sentiment of anti-Americanism, as I am sure you know, is quite widespread in Europe and in my country as well. Do you think there is any degree of your own fault in the fact that this sentiment is on the rise or-- I made some hard decisions. You know, going into Iraq was a hard decision. I can understand people not liking that. But I would hope people in Europe would understand that freedom is not owned only by Europeans, that people around the world deserve to be free. And as we act in our self-interest to fight terrorists, as we work to make sure terrorists cannot get weapons of mass destruction to cause great harm, that we will also work to free people. After all, the people of Latvia, of all people, ought to understand what it means to live under the subjugation of a doctrine that does not allow for freedom, communism. And here people are living in the Middle East, for example, under the brutal reign of tyrants, huge mass graves, massive death, people tortured. And now they are living free. And when 8 1/2 million people went to vote in Iraq, it sent a clear message that said, We will not let the terrorists intimidate us; we want to be free, just like people in the Balkans used to speak, we want to be free. You know, our country had a great history with the Baltics, that we said, Your Embassies will remain little havens for freedom. We never recognized the lack of independence in the Baltics. We always believed that you should be free. And I hope over time, the young people of Latvia understand that that is what we stand for in America. We stand for freedom. We do not believe freedom is America's gift. We believe there is universal desire to be free. And the world will be more peaceful. The hard decisions I have made I am confident will make this world a more peaceful place. Thanks very much, ENTITY. Welcome. I hope it is a good visit. I am confident it will be. I am looking forward to it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlatviantelevision", "title": "George W.

{"id": 417, "text": "And now, Democratic presidential candidate ENTITY is here with me in Milwaukee. Thank you so much, ENTITY. I appreciate your being with me. Great to be with you. This is a crucial state. You just heard Hillary Clinton say your campaigns are talking to each other about another debate. You have asked for one. Of course, as you are aware, earlier today, a Clinton campaign spokesman said your requests for debates are a quote/unquote, publicity stunt. Do you think she is serious about debating you? I certainly hope so. Look, there are huge issues facing this country. Our middle class disappearing. Grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality. A campaign finance system that is corrupt and a broken criminal justice system. And in New York State, there are additional problems. So I would hope that we would have a good debate. My understanding is she would like to do it in Brooklyn. I was born in Brooklyn. Let us do it! Game on for Brooklyn. Game on. The other big news, of course, you heard at the top of the program, you saw the video today from a Trump rally. But of course, Donald Trump's campaign manager charged with simple battery for an altercation with a reporter recently. Moments ago, he just defended that campaign manager. He said, I know it would be easy for to discard people. I do not discard people. Should Trump fire Corey Lewandowski? Well, let us see what happens in the legal process. He is been charged, and we do not find people guilty until you go through a process. But my campaign manager does not assault female journalists, let me just say that. You know, John Kasich came out and said he would if this had happened to him. He would go ahead and fire his campaign manager. If the roles were reversed, were you? Well, let me just say this. Let me just say this. What has concerned me very much about Donald Trump is the edginess of calls to violence around his campaigns. What I found absolutely shocking, not only this campaign manager's action. But he was prepared - or at least indicated that he was prepared -- to pay the legal fees for somebody who quite openly sucker-punched somebody - right, knocked them down. And when you say you are going to pay the legal fees for someone who commits a gross act of violence, what you are really telling your supporters is that violence is okay. But ENTITY, to me, all of that stuff is interesting political stuff. But what we are trying to focus on in this campaign are the issues that impact the American people. Which, frankly, is why I think our campaign is doing so well. One of the key issues that we are dealing with is a rigged economy in which millions of people today are working longer hours for lower wages. A broken trade system right here in Wisconsin. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost because companies shut down here, moved to Mexico, moved to China. We need a trade policy that works for workers, not just the CEOs of large corporations. Now, you are obviously making this case here in Wisconsin. You have the landslide wins on Saturday, right, in three crucial states. Yeah. Now you are here in Wisconsin. It is huge, right? You have got 86 delegates -- Absolutely. -- 96 if you count the ones up for grabs. Are you going to win Wisconsin? Are you confident? I am never into speculation. I will tell you that the night of the election, all right? I will tell you exactly what the results are. But it is silly to be talking about it. All I can say is we are going to work very, very hard. We have a lot of volunteers here in the state. We are going to be knocking on doors, we are going to be making phone calls. And our message about the need to create an economy that works for all people is in fact resonating here in Wisconsin. And I think you are going to see us do very well. So, one of the arguments you are making on that front, right, is free college. No, no, no - -- free public university - You see, every time I am on a show, somebody says free college. It is free tuition at public colleges and universities. OK, so on that front, though -- because it is important how you word it, your plan -- we have a federalist system. You would be chipping in money to the states, and they would then have the decision to make. Yes. Hillary Clinton says that is just not going to happen in a state like Wisconsin. Yes. Let me just play what she said, basically about you this afternoon. Here she is. I mean, Scott Walker turned down half a billion dollars in Obamacare. OK, let me just say the danger - let me just say this. Number one, in the year 2016, we have got to recognize that a college degree is pretty much the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. The world has changed. The economy has changed. We need to have the best educated work force in the world. Young people should not be denied the opportunity because they do not have the money. Or they should not have to leave school $50,000, $100,000 in debt. So we do believe, I do believe very strongly in making public colleges and universities tuition-tree. Now, what Secretary Clinton said is that Scott Walker may not go along with that. Well, you know what happens to the state of Wisconsin if he does not? California will, Vermont will, states all over this country will, and young, bright people will be leaving Wisconsin. And I think the people of Wisconsin will tell Scott Walker, you know what? This will be a disaster for the future of our state. Because when kids leave, sometimes they do not come back. So I think the idea is sound. It is paid for, ENTITY, by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. When Wall Street's illegal behavior destroyed our economy, middle class bailed them out. It is now time for them to help the middle class. What about, though, the issue on terms of the pure pay force, right? During the midst of the financial crisis when people said, let Bank of America go under. Let them go under. They do not deserve to survive, you know? You are not just talking about tens of thousands of people that would have worked for that bank, but also the millions of Americans that have -- own shares of that bank and their 401, their IRA. millions of Americans own stocks now. Middle class Americans who could end up paying for them. No, no, the vast majority of that speculation tax will be paid by upper-income people. And that is the way we have designed it. But at the end of the day, look, this campaign is not your typical campaign. It is not your Hillary Clinton campaign. We are thinking bigger and bolder. Now, you tell me, if Germany can provide in fact free college education, Scandinavia can do it, other countries around the world can do it, why cannot we do it? Why cannot we have the best educated work force in the world, which we are going to need if our economy is to survive? And let me also add this. In the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent. I know you do not talk about it too much in the media, but that is the fact. We are talking about trillions of dollars. So yes, I am running for president, and am telling the top one-tenth of one percent they are going to have to pay more in taxes. And just a question, let me take a step back about the whole idea. You say you want the best educated work force. When you look at the top-ranked countries, you are looking at places like Canada, like South Korea, like Japan. All of them require people to pay in most instances about what people pay here for public education. Listen, trust me. People are going to be paying for Harvard and Yale and all kinds of private schools. The way I see it, ENTITY, is that right now, and for the last hundred years, we have had public education which says that no matter what your income is, right? You are rich or poor, you can go from the first grade to the 12th grade for free. We take it for granted. All I am saying is that in the year 2016, with a radically changing economy, where young people need more education, let us extend that concept beyond the 12th grade through public colleges and universities. All right. ENTITY Sanders is staying with me. We are going to have much more in our exclusive conversation in just a moment in the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels. We are going to talk about that and the fight against ISIS. And we are also going to be counting down, of course, to the town hall for the GOP. Trump, Cruz, Kasich, less than an hour from now right across town here in Wisconsin Welcome back. We are live tonight in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where in less than an hour, the three remaining Republican presidential candidates will be going before voters at our town hall across town here and make their case. And of course, right now, I am talking exclusively to ENTITY, who is also come campaigning here in this must-win state up against Hillary Clinton. ENTITY, let us continue our conversation. The open primary here in Wisconsin is important. That means people can switch over. They can vote for whomever they would like, Democrats, Republicans. We have seen this across the country, people choosing between you and and Donald Trump. Some union workers, we understand here, are deeply considering whether they should vote for you or Donald Trump. Do you think they are crazy? What do you say to people who are making that choice? Well, I think we will get the vast majority of the union workers. Trump will get some, but I think we will get a lot more. I think what is going on, ENTITY, is there is a lot of anger in this country. For your average guy, he is asking why he has to work longer hours for lower wages. Why he is really worried or she is worried, mother really about the future of their children. And yet, almost all income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. People are angry. What Trump is doing is taking that anger and saying, it is the fault of the Mexicans or it is the fault of the Muslims. We have got to scapegoat people. Well, beating up on Mexicans who make eight bucks an hour is not going to deal with the real issues facing -- Are you, though, blaming rich people for it? It is not rich people, no. We are blaming a economic system right now where factually almost all the income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Where you have billionaires and large corporations that are not paying their fair share of taxes; there are some major corporations make billions a year in taxes, stash their money in the Cayman Islands, do not pay a nickel in taxes. And what I want to do is take that money, do away with that loophole, invest it in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We can create 13 million jobs over a five-year period with a trillion-dollar investment. That is roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants. It is not a question of blaming, it is a question of understanding the reality. It is a rigged economy. People on the top are doing phenomenally well; everybody else is doing worse. We have got to change that. Susan Sarandon is a supporter of yours, as you know. The actress, she said, Some people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in. Is Donald Trump more likely to bring about a revolution in this country -- and you have been having revolutionary talk. I know not of the violent sort, but in terms of making changes in this country. Is he more likely to accomplish that -- Well, I am not sure -- I heard that. I did not really see here Susan's context -- Susan's comment within a broader context. I think Trump will be a disaster for this country. I think the idea of insulting women and veterans and African-Americans and Mexicans and Muslims is precisely what this country does not need and does not want. Look, in every poll that I have seen, including a CNN poll, we were 20 points ahead of Trump. I do not believe Trump is going to become president of the United States. You do win in those head-to-heads, of course, in the polling. We spoke to some female Donald Trump supporters yesterday in Arizona. It was a fascinating conversation about why they do believe in Donald Trump, why they support him. Here is what one of them had to say. I do. Well, it is not only -- no, I do not understand his appeal to women. I do not think he is particularly popular with women in general. You cannot go around insulting women everyday and expect to gain support. But I understand where that woman is coming from. Look, people are sick and tired of establishment politicians. Politicians say one thing, they do another thing. You know, the Congress has a favorability rating of 15 percent or something. And Trump is, of course, very blunt and straightforward. But you have got to look at what he is saying. Does that woman really believe the billionaire class should receive hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks over a 10-year period? I doubt it. Does she not think that we should raise the minimum wage? Trump does not. Does she really think we should insult Muslims all over the world? I do not think she does think that. So, I think the appeal of Trump is his bluntness, is his straightforwardness. And by the way, this guy is a good entertainer. He has done a very good job manipulating the media. He is a professional at that. And he has been successful doing it. So, let me talk about Muslims and the issues that he has brought up on that. I was in Brussels last week. I spoke to a young man, and it was 10 to 15 people who have gone to Syria to fight with ISIS. I spoke to the brother of the Paris attacker - of one of the Paris attackers a few months ago in Brussels. He told me he knows many young men who are in Syria training to fight with ISIS. And they are coming back now. And yet, you can still, without a visa, get on a plane in Brussels and fly to the United States. How do you prevent these young men who say their ultimate goal is to attack the United States from coming here without racially profiling, as Donald Trump suggested? You do everything that you can. And that means you have information, and we have -- that is what intelligence services are all over the world. And you share that information. And if people are going to Syria, if they are going to training camps, they are not going to come -- or if they come back into Brussels or they come into the United States, they are going to be arrested in five minutes. We have zero tolerance for people who are going to hurt Americans or people anyplace else in the world. But intelligence services have not been coordinating. When people -- I know people in Brussels who said my son - one of - the bomber here, they said, my son is in Syria. And authorities did not care. So if they do not know the names who is there, they do not know who is coming back. But Brooke , look. No one is saying -- first of all, let us look at the broader issue. Number one in Iraq right now, ISIS on the defensive. They have lost about 40 percent of the territory they controlled. And I believe that if we are smart, if we do a good job in training the Iraqi army, and the Muslim nations, they can be destroyed in a year or two. That certainly is the goal. And second of all, we have got to do everything that with can. No one has any magical solutions. But we do have to improve our intelligence capabilities. We do have to make sure that federal, state and local law enforcement is much better coordinated in preventing these types of attacks. Before we go, federal officials, as you know, this week say they have unlocked the iPhone of one of the shooters in San Bernardino. Now, they had been suing Apple to force Apple to do just that. They figured out how to do it themselves. I know you have said you are fearful of Big Brother in America. But this is a terrorist's phone. Is it a good thing the FBI broke into it? Look, I think that clearly, we need to get all of the information that we can to stop terrorism. But at the same time, we have to be mindful that in a free society, you do not want the government, I suspect, into your telephone. Would I be correct in saying that? So, what the correct balance is what we have to determine. But I am concerned about civil liberties -- Even protecting someone's phone that massacred Americans? No, not protecting -- that is the balance. Of course, you are going to go after people who are killing Americans. That goes without saying. But it is one thing to go after a terrorist; it is another thing to have millions of people being -- having their e-mails or their websites surveyed when the vast majority of them have nothing to do with terrorism. So how you balance in a free society, the civil liberties and the constitutional rights of our people, while on the other hand, going after terrorists. That is the balance that we have got to establish. All right. Well, ENTITY, thank you very much for your time. Nice talking to you tonight. Nice to see you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitherinburnettcnn", "title": "Bernie Sanders Interview with Erin Burnett of CNN", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-erin-burnett-cnn", "publication_date": "29-03-2016", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Bernie Sanders"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 234, "text": "Thank you for speaking with us. And my first question is about your trip. You are going to Latin America, the longest trip an ENTITY has taken to the region. Why now? Why at this moment when Democrats control the Congress and there are issues that might be in their hands? Well, thank you for asking that question. This is not my first trip since I have been ENTITY I have been in traveling the neighborhood, I think, maybe three other times. But this is a long trip, and the reason why is, I want to remind people throughout our neighborhood that America cares about them. And I bring a message of hope, a message that says, we care about the human condition and a message of accomplishment. I do not know if you know this or not, but since I have been the ENTITY, our bilateral aid to Latin America has increased from 800 million to 1.6 billion. And the reason I say that is, the American taxpayer has been very generous about providing aid in our neighborhood, and most of that aid is social justice money; in other words, it is money for education and health. And yet we do not get much credit for it. And I want the taxpayers I want the American people to get credit for their generosity in Central and South America. Your daughter Jenna is writing a book about her experiences in Central America. She will be focusing on a single mother with HIV. Has she been part of your eyes and ears in the region now that she is been there for quite a while? Well, she is. First of all, I am very proud of her. She is an accomplished woman. She came back I have not seen a lot of her because she is been spending a lot of time in Central America as a UNICEF volunteer but she came back and talked to me about this young girl that she has befriended. And she is deeply concerned about alienationists in our world, and is going to try to raise some money to help the education programs there. To me, her book and her example is what America is all about. We have got compassionate people, and when we find suffering and see income disparity or see poverty, we'd like to help people lift themselves up. You have talked about the importance of free trade. Opponents of free trade in Latin America say it is one-sided and favors the U.S. Opponents of free trade in the U.S. That is right. say it is one-sided and favors those countries. So who is right, and what are you trying to do with this right now? They are both wrong. The opponents of free trade are wrong, in my judgment, because free trade a good free trade agreement and those agreements are signed by administrations and ratified by their elected assemblies fair trade agreements are beneficial to both, and that is what we want. All you have got to do is look at the trade between the United States and Mexico after the free trade agreement we signed between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. And the amount of trade has gone up appreciably, significantly. And I truly believe that one of the most effective ways to eliminate poverty is through free and fair trade. But there is no question, there is protectionist sentiments in the neighborhood and in our own Congress. And I we got the CAFTA vote by one vote in the House of Representatives, and I am going to have to work hard to get more free trade agreements through. But the fact that it is hard will not deter me from doing what I think is right. They say you are exporting American jobs. Well, that is what Americans say. I look at it differently. I think what we are doing is, we are creating opportunities for business people, small-business people, to be able to sell products in other markets, whether it be U.S. products into Central America or South America and vice versa. I also know that trade enhances the wealth of all people. I mean, it is in our interests that Mexico generate wealth so that people can make a living. If you are a person deeply concerned about immigration and as you know, this is a hot issue here in the United States does not it make sense to encourage trade so that people can find a job at home rather than feel compelled to try to find work elsewhere? And trade is you can track the success of a trade agreement and I repeat again, the success of the trade agreement with Mexico. Brazil, you are going. Ethanol seems to be at the top of the agenda. How important is this ethanol? Some analysts say that you will bring Brazil closer to the U.S.; you will develop ethanol plants in Central America and have ethanol for U.S. consumption. First of all, the alternative fuel issue is a huge issue for the United States. I mean, we are too dependent on oil. It is in our national security interests and our economic security interests and for environmental concerns to develop alternatives to gasoline. Ethanol is the is what we are investing a lot in here in the United States to do that. Brazil has been very successful, so it gives us common ground to talk. I like the idea of helping Central America, by the way, develop an ethanol industry. I think it would be good for their national security and economic security interests. But my discussion with Brazil is more than just ethanol. Brazil is a very important country in South America. We will be talking about the Doha round of global trade. I will be talking with my friend President Lula about international matters. Brazil is an international player, and the United States looks forward to working with Brazil to promote peace. Are you is free trade is this trip a way to show what the U.S. is doing and counter what other leaders might be doing? For example, Hugo Chavez, who called you the devil and says many things, said he will be in Argentina on Friday. The trip really is to remind people that we care. I do worry about the fact that some say: Well, the United States has not paid enough attention to us ; or, The United States really is not anything more than worried about terrorism. And when, in fact, the record has been a strong record. And I will be going to promote to look at programs that are have benefited from the generosity of the American people. And so it is I say, our country is a compassionate country. And there is significant connections between people inside America and people outside America. And it is in our interest that we promote those ties, and we promote and I remind people about the generosity of our country. It is not a given, by the way, that people will continue to spend that the Congress will spend money. And therefore, it is important for me to show that we are not only spending money but the effects of spending money, the positive things that are happening as we help elevate people's lives. ENTITY, I want to ask you about the conviction of Lewis Scooter Libby. Your critics are saying that his conviction makes the promise that you made to bring honor and dignity back to the White House, that this promise will go unmet. Yes, first of all, this was a lengthy trial on a serious matter, and a jury of his peers convicted him. And we have got to respect that conviction. Secondly, this is an ongoing legal matter. In other words, there is more legal procedures to take place, and, at this time, it is inappropriate for me or the administration to be issuing comments about this serious matter. On a personal note, I was sad. I was sad for a man who had worked in my administration, and particularly sad for his family. As Commander in Chief, what do you say to the veterans who have gone through a very hard time at Walter Reed and other hospitals? There are commissions; there are solutions that are being proposed. But, what do you, as Commander in Chief, say to those veterans in I say, anything other than excellent care is unacceptable. And I have been to Walter Reed a lot. There is some fantastic doctors and nurses and healers. And yet we found that there was some substandard care in part of that organization, and we are going to correct it. And I put the Commission together a series of commissions, to make sure that there that we fully understand the truth, fully elevate the problems, so we can solve them. I had Bob Dole and Donna Shalala in today. They are chairmen of this very important commission I put together that will analyze the care our soldiers get from the battlefield into the Defense Department, then into the Veterans, and then into community. And I want to make sure there is that is a seamless transition of excellent care. Muchas gracias, ENTITY.

Rabin had watched it live. What? Rabin had watched it live. And I could not tell whether Mubarak did or not. I think he did, but we had kind of a staticy connection, so I could not be sure. But everybody seemed to be pretty positive about it. Anyway, looking back over the trip, I can say without any hesitation that it certainly met all of our objectives when we went on the trip. Everything that we hoped would happen did. And I think there were basically three big elements to it. The first was the prospect of really uniting Europe for the first time since nations have been on the landscape there. I am very encouraged by the initial reaction to the Partnership For Peace. All the Central and Eastern European countries and the Visegrad nations have said they want to join. Russia, Ukraine expressed an interest. We have now heard some interest from Romania. So I am feeling quite good about that. Even the Swiss said they wanted to think about whether there was some way they could support it even if they did not join, given their historic neutrality. I feel very good about it. The second important thing, of course, was the nuclear breakthrough, the agreement with Ukraine following the agreement that had been reached earlier in the year with Belarus and Kazakhstan, not having our nuclear weapons targeted at anybody, not having their nuclear weapons targeted at us. It is a really important next step. And we also had some important discussions with the Russians about going in and making sure that START I is completely ratified and implemented and that START II is ratified and implemented and that we keep thinking about what further steps there ought to be. So this was a very good meeting trip in that respect. And then the third aspect of the trip was the whole movement toward not only uniting Europe economically and politically but kind of getting growth back into the system. I met with the leaders of the European Union. We talked about how to implement the GATT agreement, how to follow up on it, how important it was to get the growth rates up in Europe again, how important it was to open new markets to Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union. And then, of course, I talked about economics in Prague and then spent a lot of time dealing with it in Russia. And I must say, even though they have had a really tough time, I think they are on the verge of having some good things happen economically. For all the criticism of the pace of reform in Russia, one of the little-known facts about it is that in terms of privatizing companies, Russia's actually running ahead of the pace of the other former Communist economies. There is some other problems they have to deal with, their inflation problems and just having a legal framework that will attract more investment, but I feel quite good about that. Just from my experience in Moscow, I really think that while there are, as you would imagine, uncertainties among the people there because of all the hardships and the difficulty of sort of visualizing the future, I think there is a lot of emotion to the idea that the people ought to rule the country. I did not get much sense in anybody that they wanted a more authoritarian government. I think they like the fact that the voters are in the driver's seat, even though they are still trying to come to grips with exactly what that means and how to translate it into policies. So I would say on grounds of building a united Europe in terms of security, where all the neighbors agree to respect one another's borders, moving to continually reduce the nuclear threat to the world, and supporting economic and political reform in Europe and the former Communist countries, this was a very, very successful trip. And that is before we did the Middle East thing today. I went to this meeting hoping that we could get a signal from ENTITY Asad that was clear and unmistakable that he was ready to make a complete peace. Today was the first time he had ever explicitly said he wanted an end to the hostilities with Israel, willing to make peace with Israel as opposed to saying something like peace in the Middle East, and that peace to him meant normal peaceful relations, which is a general term that encompasses trade, tourism and travel, and embassies. So that was very significant. That sends a very clear signal now back to the Israelis. He also said that he did not want just Syria alone to be resolved, he wanted to see the Jordanian peace completed, and he wanted to see the Lebanese peace completed. And he said something that everybody wanted to hear in the Middle East, which is that he wanted Lebanon to be an independent country with a peace with Israel. So I was quite pleased with that. So from now on, the question of the differences between Syria and the United States, which we spent about an hour on today, spent a significant portion of our meeting on it, because I thought it was important that neither one of us be under any illusions about the differences that are still there and because I think it is important in this peace negotiation that we both have absolute credibility with each other. So we thought we had to spend some time on it. We agreed to try to get beyond sort of a general and accusatory level by letting the Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of Syria develop a process to specifically identify these things that trouble the United States so much and to give them a chance to specifically identify things about our policy toward them or the Middle East in general that trouble them and to try to set in motion a process for working through it. Because every report I have gotten over the years of the encounters and you know, Asad's spent a lot of time talking to Westerners because of the Middle East issue things always stop, in my judgment, at a level that is too general, where people are charging and countercharging and there is no real effort to lay the kind of factual basis that has to be laid if you are going to really argue that people should change their policies. So I feel pretty good about it. Were you satisfied, sir, that there was no Syrian involvement or complicity in the Pan Am 103 bombing? First I raised that, and he raised it again. I can tell you that we have absolutely no evidence of it and that he flatly denied it. And he reminded us and me that a Syrian was killed on Pan Am 103 who was the only son of a woman from his home area. And he said it was a he characterized it as a cruel and senseless thing had no point, killing all those students. And he said, This is an issue I will never close or never consider closed. If you ever have any evidence that any Syrian is involved, you just let me know, and we will take the appropriate action. Back on Russia, when were you told about that Mr. Gaydar was going to resign? Who told you that, and how serious do you think it is? All the days kind of run together. Yeltsin told me that here is how he characterized it. I was not quite sure exactly how to he told me that he thought there was a strong possibility that Gaydar would decide that he needed to devote all of his time to leading the party that he took into the Duma and building his political strength both in the Parliament and out in the country and that he was concerned about building it up politically and making it effective in the Duma. He said the reason, you see you say when I am trying to remember. I think it was sometime during the first day as opposed to the second day's conversations that he said it. But I am sorry I cannot remember when. What are your impressions of Asad? Let me answer the question. He also went out of his way to tell me, though, he said, We are not going to reverse our reform course, and we do not want to slow it down, but we do want to cushion the impact of it better. We want to have a better sense of how it affects people. And he said, We also want to try to demonstrate the successes more clearly. We want to be able to show people that this has been done. And in that connection and you know what he asked? He was very pleased with a lot of the initiatives that I told him we worked on, like we were working to get the G-7 to make sure that the countries that buy oil from Russia, for example, that buy energy from Russia, could pay for it in a timely fashion so they can use that money to help them build their country. That is a big deal to them. He was interested in getting his next IMF money in a timely fashion. He was interested in making sure that the accumulated debt, once he is making payments on it, can be rescheduled. In other words, he did not want to slow down reform. He wanted to make it work better, and he wanted to make sure that they had some strategies for cushioning the impact on ordinary people. He also said that he would keep a team that was reform oriented, and it would be a good, competent team. Gaydar left the government once before, and the reforms did not stop. So the only thing I encouraged him to do was, I said, You proved you are committed to democracy. You have stayed with this reform. You have still got some tough decisions to make. I told him, I said, I contacted the G-7 before I came up here. We want to help cushion the impact of reform, and we want to help make sure the people of Russia know what you are doing to help the economy. And if you are going to keep on the reform path, it'll be easier for us to do that, because then we will be able to make sure that the IMF and the World Bank support you as well as these individual countries. I found it to be a satisfactory conversation. You know he is in some the political situation over there is not free of difficulty. I mean, you just only have to look at the makeup of the lower House of the Parliament to draw that conclusion. But I think he will try to hang in there, mostly because if you look at the go-slower approach, you look at Ukraine and you see they are in worse shape than Russia. And one of the things and let me just say that this is something I did not even talk about on the trip but one of the things I want to spend a lot more time doing when I get back, and have our people try to be helpful on, is trying to dissect what we mean by reform, because there are at least three big elements to it. There is the privatization of government-owned companies, which Russia is doing very, very well, better than anybody else. There is the management of fiscal and monetary policy, which means you have got to keep inflation down at a reasonable level to get private investment, which means you cannot just keep on printing money to pay for subsidies in a dying industry. They are having trouble with that, although they are doing better than they were last year. Then the third area is making sure you have got the infrastructure, if I can use that much-maligned word, that will attract investment from outside the country and will permit the markets to work. That means you have got to have a system of laws relating to private property, contracts, bankruptcy, clear, unambiguous taxation laws, that sort of stuff. If you look at Czechoslovakia, which is the most I mean, the Czech Republic, which is the most successful of the former Communist countries, they are behind Russia on privatization but ahead on the infrastructure. So the one thing that I think we need to focus on is now that they have got a constitutional democracy, and all of them, even the ones who want to slow down reform, want more investment, which is interesting they all want more investment, even the ones that think, Well, reform has gone too fast they might be for the first time in a real position now to write some of the laws in such a way that will attract a lot more investment. For example, if you want to make an energy investment in Russia, you may not care what the rate of privatization of small companies is, but you do want to know if you put the money in there and who you are investing with, is your investment good, what do you do in case of breach of contract, what are your tax obligations if you make money? Just clear, simple, straightforward stuff that we take for granted, that I think they now have to do a little more work on. How concerned was Yeltsin about the rise of ultranationalist sentiment? And did you give him any counsel on how to alleviate those feelings of humiliation? Well, let me see how I should answer that. I do not want to talk in great detail about our conversation, because I think he should be able to answer that. I do not want to read his mind for you. I think that he believes that the more the voters know about some of the positions taken by the ultranationalists, including Zhirinovsky, the more likely they will be to pull away from them. And he believes that the promises which were made by the ultranationalists could not reasonably be expected to be kept. So I think that his view is that what he needs to do is try to do the best he can with his job, turn things around, show some successes, and that that is the best way to dampen them down. One thing I did say to him was that just following the campaign from afar, as we all did, that the ultranationalists seemed in some ways in some ways the Communists did, too to lay too much of an uncontested claim to the feelings of national pride. That is, the reformers, we all know, did not run in a coherent bloc and did not present a coherent message. And as the Democrats know in the United States I kicked him on purpose because he is talked about this it is sort of like the problems that the Democrats had for the last 20 years winning the Presidency. You could say, here is a problem and here is my four-point solution to the problem, but if all you get is the good government vote, that is never going to be a majority, especially when people are hurting. So the only counsel I gave him was that Yeltsin cut through all the traditional barriers when he stood up on that tank, or even earlier when he became Gorbachev's successor. He embodied the change and the pride of Russia. You did not have to choose. You saw the pride of Russia and the change in a person. And by his actions he did that. And what I suggested to him was that his group, they needed to find spokespersons, and they needed to find ways of saying what they were about that also says, We are pro-worker, we are pro-family, we are anticrime, and we are for bringing the pride of this nation back. And our plan will make the . Because I think to be fair to them, their task has been so daunting that they would naturally become absorbed in the overwhelming burdens of just doing the details of it. These other guys were never in government, you know; they had the freedom of just going out and making speeches. And the only thing I cautioned to Yeltsin, I said, Look, I saw the Democrats in America get killed for years because they go out there and they talk about problem X, Y, and Z and have a four-point program for every one. And they might be right, but if it did not resonate with a larger concern to the voters, it could never be translated into a national mandate. And I think we had a great conversation about it, and I think he was interested in it, because he understands that that is how he got to be ENTITY in the first place, change and pride. You do not think he is emotional enough? Oh, no, I think he is deeply emotional enough. But in the last election, keep in mind, he put all of his prestige and effort into passing the Constitution. And he prevailed. So a lot of people voted for Boris Yeltsin and his constitution and also voted for the Communist candidate, the agrarian candidate, Zhirinovsky and his crowd. That is the point I am trying to make. And he needs to win the overlap. He cannot let them win the overlap if he is going to govern the country and move it forward. Hafiz al-Asad of Syria How about Asad, what are your impressions? Smart. Very tough. What is that? He is very smart and very tough and has a very clear view of what he thinks has happened in the Middle East in the last 25 years and what he thinks ought to happen. On the other hand, I think that he has reached the conclusion that it is in the interest of his people, his administration, and his legacy to make a meaningful and lasting peace. I believe that. talk about moving his troops out of Lebanon at all? Well, he said, first of all, that he thought that he agreed with me that there ought to be a peace in Lebanon agreement that operated and was developed in parallel with the Syrian track and that the end of it ought to be a fully independent Lebanon, an accord consistent with the Taif accords, which then therefore, the inevitable answer is yes. Did he ask you, if there was peace between Israel and Syria, we would follow through on our commitment to commit U.S. troops to the Golan Heights in order to keep the peace? He did not ask it just like that. He said that there needed to be mutual security guarantees, that Israel's security was not all that was at stake, that Damascus was closer to the Golan than Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, and that artillery would go up the hill quite nicely. That is what he said. He said, We are not talking about rifles here. He said, Rifles all the advantage goes to the people on top of the Golan. When you are talking about artillery, it is a mixed bag. He did not breach that. What he said was that both sides would need security assurances. We would be willing to commit our troops if there was a serious peace agreement? What I said to him and what our country has said repeatedly for years now is that, obviously, if both sides made an agreement and both sides wanted this, we would have to give it serious consideration; that is something I would have to talk to the Congress about, do other things, that I could not make any kind of commitment, particularly in the absence of an expressed decision by Israel and Syria, but we would certainly give it consideration. You certainly think you pushed the momentum on this. Oh, yes, I think it is forward now. We have pushed it forward. It is clearly the biggest step forward since September 13th. Maybe in some ways a bigger one because we all knew on September 13th that in the end the only way to hold this thing together was to get the rest of it done. Did you bring up the issue of the Syrian control of Hezbollah and other terrorist groups that are operating through Syrian-controlled Lebanon in attacks upon Israel? I brought up Hezbollah, the Jibril group, and the PKK specifically, as I said in my press conference that I did. I did. And he gave his view that he is stated many times. He stated his position; I restated mine. I said, Look, we are not going to resolve this today, but that we cannot have normal relations between the two of us, as opposed to what is going on in the Middle East, until they are resolved. And so I suggested that we give the Secretary of State and the Syrian Foreign Minister the opportunity to develop a mechanism to try to honestly and openly deal with these issues and let us bring our concerns in real specificity to them, let them respond, and see if we can work through it. What was the real highlight of your trip? What will be the thing that you truly remember, sentimentally, emotionally, spiritually? Well, the sentimental highlight was walking across the bridge in Prague for the first time in 24 years with Havel with this enormous sense of pride I had at the freedom that he had brought to the country and what I remembered from all the young people when I was there in Czechoslovakia 24 years ago, how deeply anti-Communist they were 24 years ago, how desperately they wanted to be free. And just walking across the bridge with me, this guy who had gone to prison for his beliefs and who so completely represented the best of his culture, you know, was the ENTITY of the country. And then we walked across the bridge, and then had dinner in that little pub with the couple that I stayed with 24 years ago. That was the sentimental highlight. The emotional highlight was going into that cathedral that has just been resanctified that Stalin tore down and turned into a public restroom and being invited by the priest to light a candle for my mother. Those are just personal things, you know. Any disappointments? No. I still think we have got to I would not call it a disappointment because to be disappointed it has to fall short of your expectations but I think we have got some work to do within NATO in defining this whole area of out-of-area missions. Is NATO going to have a military mission beyond protecting the security of its members and the Partnership For Peace? I am more convinced than I was when I went there that the Partnership For Peace is the right idea at this time and that we are giving Europe a chance to have a different history than its past, and it is enormously significant. But we do not have the NATO NATO was never organized or set up for out-of-area missions. They have done a terrific job with the airlift. I talked to some of our personnel today in Switzerland who were working with the airlift. They have done a great job with the mechanics of the embargo. It was never conceived that NATO would use force in any way, even in a very limited way, outside guaranteeing the security of its members. And I just think that, not only in terms of Bosnia but just generally, that whole thing has to really be thought through. Just a last question. Did you expect it to take off, the whole question of partnership, like it did? And, two, who thought of the idea first? Was this an NSC saying we have got to go there with something positive? The answer to the first question is, I did not know what to expect. But it is taken off; it is exceeded my expectations. I mean, I just knew how passionately I felt that it was the right approach. And I knew that I had to work through in my own mind, sort of; it was one of those things that the more I thought about it, the stronger I felt about it. It is not something, as you all know, that just knocks you off your feet once you hear about it; we all know that. But the more I thought about it, the stronger I felt about it. And I think what is happened was there began to be a consensus in Europe that this was what made sense; that we had to try for a better future, not just a better division than we had before the cold war but a future without division; and that if we could do it in a way that would permit us if circumstances turned against that dream to still do the responsible thing by those that clearly were part of the West that wanted to be part of it, then we ought to do it. Tony would have to answer the other question in terms of the label and all that, but it was an American idea. We started by consulting all the allies; we realized that there were a whole range of reasons for reservations for immediately expanding membership. And then there were some who had some question about whether NATO had any role at all. And we talked through what our objectives were independent of NATO. What would you like to have happen in Europe in 10 years? What is it we are trying to get done? And then all of our folks went back together and came back with that idea. I have no idea who thought of it, who labeled it or who I got it through the NSC and State and Defense. We all talked it through before I got there, because it was essentially a military training and planning concept. And I am sure somebody knows the answer to your question, but I do not . I am sure that it was a synthesis. Yes. I think it is something they just sort of came to.

{"id": 507, "text": "Good morning, ENTITY. We are very pleased to have this opportunity for this first radio interview with you. Some foreign policy questions, if I may, to start off. What will be item number one on the table when you sit down with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Malta? To be sure that we are not operating in a way that there will be unnecessary misunderstanding. In other words, I use the analogy of two big ships passing in the night: I do not want that to happen. I want to be on the same wavelength as much as we can. So, I would say the meeting is designed to see that the two ships do not pass in the night for lack of light. But what specifically will you bring up first? Well, as I say, we have not ever set an agenda. Clearly, I will be interested in getting his views on the dynamic changes taking place in Eastern Europe. We will have detailed conversations about his economy, and I will be glad to talk to him about ours. And so, I think along those two areas you will see a lot of discussion. And also, I will be bringing up, and I expect he will be prepared to discuss, regional tensions: problems in this hemisphere, support for Nicaragua, for example; Afghanistan; other areas where Soviet interest and the United States do not parallel each other. You sent him a message in reply to his earlier cable, again saying that you support the reforms going on in his country and in Eastern Europe. Do you support them to the extent that you'd put your money where your mouth is, so to speak, and grant the Soviets some sort of economic assistance to spur those reforms? Well, I am perfectly prepared to discuss economic reforms and what the Soviets would like to see in terms of interest from the West. But I noted with great interest Mr. Shevardnadze's view when asked a similar question. He said: We are not looking for aid. We are not wanting somebody to bail us out. That is good. They are a sovereign state, have a high degree of pride but clearly, there will be a discussion of economic matters as they affect the Soviet Union. When you say, as you did in a speech this week, that the Malta summit the Malta meeting, as you all here prefer to call it will not be used to negotiate the future of Europe, what does that mean? Are you taking something off the table there? No. What I am saying is we are not going to have a Yalta. To what extent? When you are not To the extent that it is not the role of the United States of America and the Soviet Union to divide up things or alter borders or do some of the things that took place at the meeting I have just referred to. We are not going to get into that. It is a broad, general meeting we would not do it anyway. Another part of the world. Have you, indeed, approved a covert plan that allows the CIA to recruit people to overthrow Manuel Noriega in Panama? Of course I'd love to see Noriega out there, but you know I never discuss intelligence. I was head of the intelligence community for 1 year, a little over a year about a year and one thing that I know you do not do is discuss covert action or rumors about covert action, or confirm or deny covert action. And I wish other people would conduct themselves in that same manner, and then maybe some of the efforts of an intelligence community could be more effective. So, I will not confirm or deny anything of that nature. Now, if you'd like me to state would we like to see Noriega out of office absolutely. I know you want him out of office. How far will you go to get him out? Well, that is a question that is so open-ended it cannot possibly be answered. Well, let me ask you this. Since you will not answer that and you will not talk about the specific plan, do you still feel that your hands are tied? I am not saying there is a specific plan. Okay. Since you will not even confirm whether there is a specific plan Now we are going, now we are talking. do you still feel your hands are tied by Congress on matters like this? This matter specifically? No, not on this matter specifically, and if there were to be a plan and I think we have a pretty good understanding with the Intelligence Committee at this point, in the Senate and in the House. Back to Eastern Europe. Is reunification of the two Germanys is that inevitable? I gave my view on that, and I said that that was a matter for the people of the Germanys to determine. And it is a highly sensitive matter as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, and it is better to leave it right there. But when you look at the way events are going there, is it inevitable in your opinion? Well, that is very hypothetical because there are so many things that can intervene. And I would say it is a matter for the determination of the German people. Well, many people look at the history books, and they worry about that prospect. Is that a legitimate concern? Well, we have had discussions with countries that express concerns in this regard because of certain historical precedents, but I do not think that history need repeat itself if there evolves a single German State. But that is down the road, and it is not something that is being pressed. And I repeat: That is a matter for the determination of the German people. Some Members of Congress look at this situation in Europe, and they see it as ripe for debate on considering cutting the defense budget, taking a big chunk out of it. Does that make sense to you? No, it does not make sense to me. Military Reductions in Europe What about reducing NATO and Warsaw Pact forces there? A lot of people think We already have made proposals. We have a bold proposal, a leadership proposal by the United States that has wide support amongst our allies, to do exactly that. Will that be on the table in Malta? Well, it is on the table now. If Gorbachev comes in, and he says why do not we agree to it here? a lot of experts think that he will come in and say that. He is already agreed to it in principle. The Soviet Union has there is no great debate on the principles of the reductions that we have proposed. But the problem is we are hammering out a lot of detail now that cannot be done at a Malta meeting or that has to be done in a multilateral forum. And so, I have been very pleased that the Soviets have been quite supportive of this United States-NATO initiative. Would you be willing to use the Malta meeting as a setting to sign off on such an agreement once I do not want to elevate the expectations of a watching world. That is not going to take place at Malta because the details have not been worked out in the multilateral forum where they are being discussed in Vienna. It just will not be ready by then. Quick domestic question My hope is that it can meet the timetables I set and the alliance set. And they were very ambitious. But it is not December 2d. Quick domestic question. Will you sign this DC appropriations bill that includes allowing the use of local funds for abortions for poor women? I have made very clear that I they can test me all they want; they can package it any way they want, but if it expands the use of federally appropriated funds for abortion, I am not going to sign it. And I have been very honest and direct with the District. This is local funds. Well, let me see what it is then, if there is something different. But if it is appropriated federally, why, I have great difficulty with that, and have been very open with the Congress on it. This is still a very painful subject for you, is not it? It is, I do not like it. I know that our party is big enough to have people in it who differ on this question. There is no question about that. If that were not true, I guess I would not have been elected ENTITY, because this issue was widely presented to the American people and very openly debated in debates with Mr. Dukakis, who felt quite differently about it. Well, if the party is big enough, why is it that policymakers in the health area are required to share your views before they are Because I was elected to perform on certain things. They do not have to share them on every iota crossing every t and dotting every i but I am I was elected to do certain things. And I want somebody in housing that can support the general initiative on housing. I want people on health that share my respect for human life. I want people in Treasury that like to see this deficit come down in a certain way. That is not such a radical concept. They tell me the time is up. I have to ask one kicker. Can you confirm these widespread White House stories that your dog has been eating rats and squirrels? She is doing her part. Has she been eating rats and squirrels? Not eating them. Just killing them. Our dog is a fearless hunter, and what she does on her own time that is her business. What does it tell us that there are rats in the White House yard here? Look, I just want to keep them out of the swimming pool. One jumped in there when Barbara was swimming. And we are relying heavily on Millie to cut that down. ENTITY, thank you very much. There was a mouse in this very room you are sitting in. I hope that does not terrify you, but he was done in the other day, too. Thank you very much for joining us, sir.

{"id": 531, "text": "Listen, were you there in person? Yes. One, I am really glad I came. There was never any question I would come. Last night we hosted a reception at the Embassy for many of the leaders of the Catholic Church at home, and they were very grateful that I came and Laura came and Dad came and President Clinton came and Condi came as well as others. And I told them, to a person, that it is such an honor to represent our country at a ceremony honoring a truly great man who is and will always be a great historical figure. I knew the ceremony today would be majestic, but I did not realize how moved I would be by the service, itself, by the beautiful music. I was struck as an aside struck by the fact that the sound was so clear in this huge facility. It was as if we were inside the cathedral listening, and the voices were so pure. I thought the homily was really good. We were given an English version, fortunately if you have not read it, maybe you have seen it? Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautifully done. I was struck by the response of the crowd. And I think it is interesting to note the moments where the crowd responded. One in particular is when His Eminence spoke to His Holiness's relationship to the young of the world, and there was a great outpouring of enthusiasm for that line. And then I think the thing that struck all our delegation most intensely was the final scene of the plain-looking casket one of three, by the way, lead, wood, and wood being carried and held up for the seal to be seen, and then the sun pouring out. This will be one of the highlights of my Presidency, to have been at this great ceremony. So off we go to home now. Your predecessor suggested that the Pope would leave a mixed legacy, even though he was a great man. Since you differed with him on the war to such a great degree, do you also think it will be a mixed legacy? I think Pope John Paul II will have a clear legacy of peace, compassion, and a strong legacy of setting a clear moral tone. You are going to see Prime Minister Sharon soon. There is been some talk in Israel that maybe you are not going to raise this issue of this latest settlement expansion. Are you going to do that? I have raised the issue of settlement expansions publicly. I mean, it was upon the prompting of your question. You bet. What I say publicly, I say privately. And that is, the roadmap has clear obligations on settlements and that we expect the Prime Minister to adhere to those roadmap obligations. And the roadmap has got obligations for the Palestinians. We have a great opportunity we, the world, has a great opportunity to help a democracy grow begin and grow, starting in the Gaza. The Prime Minister of Israel has decided to pull out of Gaza. As you know, I applauded that decision at the White House, with him standing by my side. And I think now is the time to focus the world's attention on what is possible. And we have already started that process of realizing the possible by having General Ward work with the Palestinians to streamline and coordinate Palestinian security forces so that, upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, there is a security presence that will protect people. We have got to do more. We have got to make sure that an economy can flourish there. So you are going to try to talk him out of this latest settlement expansion he is talking about? My position is clear, and I will I stated, obviously, now the second time in a brief period of time, and I will say so privately as well. I think you need to know what the successful strategy will be. And that is there is more than just security in Gaza. We need to have institution-building, and there needs to be an international effort that encourages and fosters economic vitality so that a government which does emerge in Gaza will be able to better speak to the hopes of those who live in the Gaza. And success in the Gaza will make success on the West Bank easier. And so one of our I will be talking to the Prime Minister about the need to work with the Palestinian Government, President Abbas, to facilitate success, to enhance success. Let me make sure I go back to the first answer on His Holiness. I said I think my answer was, is that what did I say? I asked if you thought it was a mixed message, and you said, I think John Paul II will have a clear legacy of peace. A clear and excellent legacy, if you do not mind adding the word excellent. Clear and excellent. Yes. In other words, a strong legacy. I wanted to make sure there was a proper adjective to the legacy I thought he left behind. It was more than just clear. Okay. Yes, you said strong legacy of setting a clear moral tone. Fine. Okay, good. Getting back to the Middle East for a moment, there have been hopeful signs in the region lately. But some in the region think that some of our allies there, particularly Saudi Arabia and Egypt, still are not doing enough to help foster democracy in their own countries. Do you think they are doing enough, or are you encouraging them to We will continue to encourage democracy. But I also have said many times that it is important for those of us who live in a democratic society to remember two things: One, our own road to democracy was a little bumpy; we have a Constitution and a Declaration of Independence but, nevertheless, had slavery for a long period of time, for example. And secondly, that we should not expect others to adapt that which we think we should not try to impose our democracy on other nations. What we should say is, We will work with you to develop a democracy which adapts to your own cultures and your own religions and your own habits. I am fully aware that there is work to be done. But I think it is also our job to encourage those nations and, at the same time, recognize that all nations are not starting at the same spot in order to achieve democracy. I mean, Iraq, it is very important for us in Iraq to recognize that we we transferred sovereignty 10 months ago. Remember we all traveled to NATO to the NATO summit? And it may seem like an eternity to you all but 10 months in the greater scheme of things is a short period of time. And nevertheless, during that short period of time, the Iraqis have voted, and today they have announced their Prime Minister. The Government will be up and running, the Government Assembly there, to write a constitution. In other words, things are happening quite rapidly, which is positive. But nevertheless, there is a certain there is got to be a certain realism about how fast things can possibly happen, given where different nations have started from. Now, I will continue to press forward on encouraging democracy and reform in every nation, because I believe that is the ultimate strategy to defeat the terrorists. In the short run, we will continue to find them and work with nations to find them and share intelligence to find them, bring them to justice. In the long term, the spread of freedom and democracy democracies reflecting the nature of the people and the history of those countries will mean that generations will more likely grow up in peace. When you sat there surrounded by that incredibly array of world leaders and looked forward to the kind of spread of democracy you are talking about, is there something about just that assemblage there? Who did you talk to? Who did you see? And did it strike you that this was a remarkable ability to pull together such disparate people? I was most attentive to the ceremony, itself, and was amazed by the size of the crowd. We came walking out of the grand stairway, and it was a very inspiring sight. And the flags. And the flags and the statues and just yes, the bishops and the archbishops and different leaders of the churches right across the way from me. Of course, the cardinals you know, a handful of whom I know, have gotten to know quite well and admire greatly, by the way. So that was pretty well my focus there. When I first got there when Laura and I first got there, we shook hands with the folks around us. Obviously, Jacques and Madam Chirac were right next door; I spent some time visiting with them. But everybody there was there was not much chitchat. There was intense focus on the ceremony. But what it represented, to have that many people No, I understand. I believe that is part of the power of Pope John Paul II. And he was such a believer in freedom. I saw Lech Walesa, for example. I was struck by the number of Polish flags that were in the crowd. You know what was really interesting? There were some signs urging that His Holiness be made a saint. Now! Now, yes subito. You know, I really did not reflect that much on the politics of the moment during the ceremony. I was more I thought a lot about Pope John Paul II. I mean, here is a person who has shown that a single individual can make a big difference in history and that, in my judgment, he received his great power and strength from the Almighty. Just to follow up on that, ENTITY, a couple questions about the Pope. One, I noticed at one point you had your glasses on, and you were following along I am not sure if you were looking at the homily at that point or maybe, did you have one of those guides that I did. It is hard to follow my Spanish is not very good nevertheless, it is decent enough to pick up sounds that then can help me follow the Italian. Had you ever been to a Latin mass before? I imagine you have been to an English mass. No, never been to a Latin mass. The other question was, we never had a chance to you talked about a lot about what struck you from this ceremony. We never got a chance to talk to you about, by contrast, how you were struck by the wake, if you will, when you went through the other night. How do the two ceremonies you know, different kinds of emotions in the two? I felt I mean, obviously, we were surrounded by a crowd at the wake, but I felt when I was kneeling there, I felt I am trying to think of the right word alone is not the right word, because I was aware of people, but felt much more in touch with a spirit. I really did. I was very much felt at peace there and was prayerful. And at the other ceremony, it was probably just because of all the sights and sounds and majesty and colors that, you know, I felt more like a spectator than a participant, but more of a spectator. You knew him personally, I mean, to kneel there and see his body after you have met with him so many times and had I mean, that must have been quite powerful and My relationship with Pope John Paul II was a very good relationship. He was such a gentle man, and at the end of his life he made his points to me with his eyes. The last visit, as you know, he was pretty physically he was struggling, and yet his eyes twinkled, just real clear. Much of the communications was done by paperwork, which Did he speak English? Some, but it was hard to really understand him because he was struggling. That is why it is really interesting for people to note that there was a lot of testimony and in my remarks, I tried to witness that as well that his struggle at the end of his life and the dignity with which he struggled was a clear example of Christ's influence in his life. I was honored to see that firsthand. He is one of the great vigorous leaders mountain climber, educator, instructor who then had to struggle using the very tools that enabled him to be a vigorous teacher, outdoorsman, freedom fighter, and yet, nevertheless, he still could communicate clearly through eyes which were, you know, crystal clear. And I remember the Castel Gandolfo, when Laura and I went to visit him. And he took us out on the balcony. The Castel overlooks this fantastic lake; it is a spectacular lake. And he was much more conversant then. I think it might have been my first trip? It was 2001. Yes. Right before or after Genoa, the G-8 in Genoa. And he had a sparkle; he really wanted to show us this beautiful setting. I would define Pope John Paul II as a clear thinker who was like a rock. And tides of moral relativism kind of washed around him, but he stood strong as a rock. And that is why millions one of the reasons why millions came to admire and love him. I was asked by some of the leadership of the Church, was I surprised at the turnout? I said, Not at all, because millions from all religions, millions of Catholics and millions of others admired his strength and his purpose and his moral clarity. How did the Pope struggle with his health at the end of his life and his example throughout his life strengthen your own faith? Well, you know, it is as clear example of Christ's influence in a person's life that he maintained such a kind of hopeful, optimistic, clear point of view amidst struggles in his case, physical struggles. And that is a lot of Christians gain great strength and confidence from seeing His Holiness in the last stages of life. Do you think that will help you in the months and years ahead, in your own life? Well, I think all of us get touched in different ways if you are on a faith journey we are all affected differently. But yes, I think my relationship with and Pope John Paul II's example will serve will be a moment in my life that will strengthen my faith and my belief not just me, more significantly, millions of people whose life he touched. I think we might have witnessed I do not know perhaps the largest funeral in the history of mankind. I am not sure if that is true or not; somebody said that might be true. But there is a reason why the largest crowd ever to come and pay homage to a human happened, and it is because of the man's character, his views, his positions, his leadership capacity, his ability to relate to all people, his deep compassion, his love of peace. There is a reason why. Again, I repeat, I was honored to be one of many there, and I know you all were as well. Besides the pomp and the majesty and the colors, there was a spirit that was an integral part of the ceremony. For me, the spirit was also at the wake, but more personal at the wake. That was a personal moment. ENTITY's Faith If there was ever a moment where you ever had any doubts in your own faith, what out of the past public things would strengthen your resolve and firm up your relationship with your God? I think a walk in faith constantly confronts doubt, as faith becomes more mature. And you constantly confront, you know, questions. My faith is strong. The Bible talks about, you have got to constantly stay in touch with the Word of God in order to help you on the walk. But the Lord works in mysterious ways, and during all our life's journeys, we are enabled to see the Lord at work if our eyes are open and our hearts are open. And today you can analyze, and you can look at the coffin being held, with the sun shining on it, anyway you want. I happen to feel it was a special moment that was part of a special ceremony for a special person. And it helped strengthen my faith. And you can have your faith strengthened on you can have your faith strengthened when you stand up at a faith-based initiative and see someone standing up and testify to what their love has done to help a child or how a child's life has been helped. My faith gets strengthened when I went to the school the other day and saw the mentoring relationship between a young professional woman and a young kid who is going to go to the SEED School where there is a 95-percent chance that kid is going to go to college. And that helps strengthen my faith. So there is , you know, ways whether the moment be majestical or whether the moment be a part of just an average your average moment in life, you can find ways to strengthen your faith. And it is necessary to do so, in my judgment. There is a it is called a walk. It is not called a moment or a respite ; it is a walk. It is a constant maturing of an understanding of a and today's ceremony, I bet you, for millions of people was a reaffirmation for many and a way to make sure doubts do not seep into your soul. Given that, how difficult do you think that it will be finding a successor to fill his shoes? Look, I am interested in working with whoever the successor is. And I think that, as Cardinal McCarrick said at the ceremony on Saturday, the day His Holiness died, asked for prayers as he began his journey as one of the electors, as a Cardinal. You know, I am not going to prejudge the selection process. Are there any qualities that you are specifically looking for? I am not a part of the selection process. I will be a ENTITY representing a great nation in dealing with a great institution with which we have diplomatic relations. It is got to be a tough act to follow, though. ENTITY's Meeting With Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi Can you tell us a little bit about your dinner with Prime Minister Berlusconi? Did you talk, particularly, on Iraq? Did the subject come up, in terms of the intelligence officer who was killed by Americans? Yes, it did come up, and I expressed my regret once again and assured him that the investigation would be conducted in an aboveboard, transparent way. Did he say it had been a problem for him in keeping the support that there is in Italy for having troops in Iraq? No, he reaffirmed his commitment to which he has given in the past that we have got to make sure we complete the mission, that we help Iraqis to fight off the few. He knows what I know, that the sooner that gets done, the sooner our troops will be able to come home. But he is also aware that what we do not want to do is leave prematurely, so that we do not complete our job. And the new Government is just about to be stood up; we look forward to working with the new Government on a lot of things and a lot of fronts. But on the security front, it is to make sure we are in sync with our training schedules, make sure that the chain of command within the military and between the civilian government and the military are strong and capable and will endure. We have been waiting for this new Government so that we can then strategize. And as soon as the Government is sworn in, the appropriate folks, we can get Zal confirmed quickly, get him out there of course, we have a good, strong Deputy Chief of Mission there now, upon swearing in of course, I will be in contact with the Prime Minister. I have already spoke to And General Casey, as well as the Charge I mean, the Deputy Chief of Mission will be in touch with; Condi will be touch with her counterpart; Secretary Rumsfeld will be in touch with his counterpart as we strategize as to how to move forward. As we strategize on tactics, on how to implement the strategy which is clear which is, we want to train you and make you as efficient as possible as quickly as possible, so that all of us can begin to, you know, as I say, bring our troops home with the honor they have earned. Italy is going to pull out 3,000 troops, I think, by the fall. Will you be able to absorb that? I do not know why you say that. I am not sure why you said what you just said. I thought that was the number of troops Italy had in Iraq, and I They have got 3,300 now, and you said they are going to pull 3,000 out by the fall? Well, I guess I do not Okay. What I did hear was, is that the Prime Minister wants to work to make sure we complete the mission. But I am not sure where that came from. Do you think he will leave troops in if, in fact, enough have not been trained? I think we will work to complete the training mission of the Iraqis. And it is important we do it and get it right. The amazing thing is, is that if you really think about what is happened in the 10-month period, in spite of some very difficult days and in spite of some tragedy, loss of life, this country is there is a democracy emerging in this country. And it was really kicked off by the huge vote of over 8 million people. But no, we will work with all our coalition, continue to make sure we stay in touch with all our I had breakfast with Tony Blair this morning, speaking about coalition. You know, I stay in regular contact with the Prime Minister. Can I ask you about Tom DeLay, the statement he made in the wake of the Schiavo case, that judges were out of control and should be held accountable. What did you think about those? I believe in an independent judiciary. I believe in proper checks and balances. And we will continue to put judges on the bench who strictly and faithfully interpret the Constitution. ENTITY, I know you are not you have said you have often said you are not consumed by polls, but a fair amount has been written lately about your approval ratings, which in some polls are at sort of a low point. Some polls Some of them were going up the other day. Okay. Well, some say that You can find them going up, and you can find them going down. In general, what You can pretty much find out what you want in polls, is my point. What about the theory that your Presidency is moving from one dominated by foreign policy to one of domestic policy? Ironically, now that some of things are settling down in Iraq and Afghanistan and you are facing tough issues like Social Security, it is a little tougher road to hoe. What are your thoughts? My thoughts are the ENTITY has always got to balance foreign policy and domestic policy, and I will I did so in the first term. As you might remember, we were confronted with a recession, and I felt we needed to reform schools, and at the same time, I had to fight the war on terror. We are continuing to fight the war on terror. The war on terror goes on, and that is the important thing for me to continue to remind our fellow citizens. By the way, we will work to defeat the enemy by, you know, making sure our troops are well framed up, prepared, ready to move quickly. It is part of the transformation process that the Secretary is leading. And to make sure our intelligence services mesh and work closely together, I am looking forward to getting John Negroponte confirmed as quickly as possible, so we can deal with this crucial aspect. But there is also, obviously, a domestic component. There was a domestic component in the first term. There is a domestic component in the second term. I might remind you that at points during the tax debate, I can remember people had declared that tax relief was dead on arrival. Occasionally, somebody would say something that was not very positive about the process, and people would all of a sudden assume that nothing was going to get done. So I am accustomed to, you know, the process of getting a piece of legislation out. And I am very optimistic that when it is all said and done, the legislators will understand that the American people recognize there is a problem in Social Security and expect something to be done. And I look forward to being a part of that. I had laid out a timetable to make it clear to the American people my views about the problems inherent in Social Security. And I think we are making progress. I think slowly but surely, the American people are coming to realize there is a serious problem with Social Security not if you have retired. And that is the other aspect of making sure we succeed in the Social Security debate, is to make sure seniors know they are going to get their checks. And we have got work to do on that. Still think it will pass this year? I certainly hope so, because now is the time to fix the problem. Every year we wait costs billions of dollars more. And I fully realize some people would rather me not be discussing this issue. The job of the ENTITY is to set an agenda that deals with problems. And sometimes sometimes the legislature does not want to deal with the problem. But I am going to continue to remind all of us in Government that when we see a problem, we have an obligation to do something about it, no matter what some may think are the short-term political consequences. I happen to believe that not dealing with the problem will create political consequences when the public realizes how serious the problem is. If you do not deal with the problem or you go home and say, I am not dealing with the problem, there will be a political consequence. I have learned that lesson, as a Governor and ENTITY, that the people expect and respect people for setting agenda items and staying focused on achieving a solution to the problem. And I have set an agenda. I set an agenda on energy. We need an energy bill. You know, we have been talking about energy for 4 years. Now, I fully realize an energy bill reflects a longer-term strategy. But we need to we need to do a lot of things. Eventually what we are going to have to do is change our habits, change the types of automobiles we drive. I believe we will have a zero-emission coal-fired electricity plant. I saw the when we went to Cleveland or Columbus, we saw the technology involved with that. But Congress needs to get me an energy bill. And it seems like to me, with the price of gasoline where it is, that ought to be enough this time to cause people to get moving on the bill. But I will continue to push it. We need to get a budget. We passed I put a pretty good budget, a real good budget. It helps cut the budget in half the deficit in half over a 5-year period of time. Now they need to get their differences worked out and get it to my desk. I will be a part of that process as well. And then, eventually, we are going to have this tax relief commission come forward. In other words, I have an obligation to set agenda items. And when I set one, I will continue to work it and remind people that we have a duty to deal with these problems. I like the debate, by the way, as an aside. I am enjoying this. I am enjoying Even if a lot of because I feel I got elected for a reason. My nature is such that, if I came to Washington and saw a problem and did not deal with it, I would not feel very good about myself. I want it to be said that George W. Bush got elected and did what he said he was going to do, for starters. You covered my campaigns. Every speech, I talked about Social Security. And I started talking about Social Security in the year 2000, because I recognized a problem coming down the road. And it is a serious problem, particularly if you are a younger American. You have no problem if you are receiving a Social Security check. I do not care and I am going to say it like you have heard me say it it does not matter what the propagandists say, people are going to get their checks. You might remember the ads that they ran against me when I was running for office that said, If George W. gets elected, you are not going to get your check. I am sure you guys analyzed those and realized that upon election, people got their checks, which might say something about those who ran the ads, right? Well, they are saying it again. They are trying to frighten seniors in order to stop people from coming together. Now, in 2001, something that has lost a little bit of the focus of those covering this issue, I called together the Moynihan Commission, and I think it might be wise for people who analyze this issue to refresh their memory about the Moynihan Commission, because the Moynihan Commission, made up of equally Democrats and Republicans, came up with some interesting ideas to solve this problem. How deeply have you had to draw down on that political credit that you felt you had? I think you get I think you earn capital, you know? I think Are you spending any? I am spending a lot every time I go out. But you earn capital by spending capital; that is what the people expect. We have got trips I will be keeping going out, reminding people that there is a problem. And one of these days, we will be able to look back and say, You know, we were successful convincing the American people there was a problem, and we were successful reminding seniors that you are not going to have your check taken away from you. And then all of a sudden, it becomes a true generational issue, because the grandparents receiving the checks, they are going to start asking, Now that I am secure, what are you going to do for my grandkid, because the grandchildren are going to pay an enormous price. You heard those experts sit up there and say that if nothing happens it is likely younger workers are going to have to pay an 18-percent payroll tax. Now, I was born prior to 1950. But if I were my daughter hearing somebody predict that at some point in time she is paying an 18-percent payroll tax, I'd be suggesting to the old man me that I get something done. And that is what we are doing. We are working hard to get it done. Are you surprised that it is taken this much work, this long No. to make progress on this, because, you know No. And this is a difficult issue. I have heard Members say I am not going to tell you who they are nor what party they are from; I wish you had not have brought this up. We hear the talk out of Capitol Hill saying, Oh, darn, I wish the ENTITY had just focused only on the budget or maybe the energy bill. There are a lot of people who would rather not talk about this issue. I understand that. Again, I do not think that is part of my job description, avoid issues because it may be politically difficult. I think my job description is, if you see a problem, talk about it and work with members of both political parties to come up with a solution. And there is beginning to be some talk on Capitol Hill. But I am not the least bit surprised, because it is a tough issue for Members, for people who've got, you know, a relatively short-term horizon, 2-year horizon. They are worried about some of them are worried about elections. Some of them in both the House and the Senate from both parties, by the way are thinking longer term. And they are beginning to talk some ideas, and that is constructive. You know, I remember I was telling President Clinton, I remember watching one of his townhall meetings in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on this very subject. And I thought it was a very impressive presentation. By the way, a lot of the language happens to be pretty close to some of the townhall meetings we have had. But, no, I am not surprised people want to avoid this issue. What has it been like spending time with the former ENTITYs for 3 days? That is the longest time It is fun. Oh, it is great. You know, we share war stories, you know, a lot of talking, a lot of interesting experiences about different world leaders that we may all have met or all three of us met, just different experiences that, you know, my dad might have had or President Clinton might have had. There is a lot of interest, obviously, with former ENTITYs about, you know, policy, so I had them sit in on our policy briefings this morning with Condi and Steve and the CIA fellow traveling with us not this morning, yesterday and the day before, on Air Force One. And then yesterday at the Embassy, I wanted to include them in. And you know, we had a these CIA briefings a lot of time prompt policy discussions, you know, how is this process going. Steve and Condi, now that she is here both of them were able to bring Dad and President Clinton up to date on our strategy in dealing with a particular issue. It is interesting to get their points of view about their experiences in particular countries. It was fun. It was really a lot of fun. I was honored they came. Are you worried about them spending so much time together, those two? Well, you heard my gridiron speech. Listen, thank you all. Hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. Absolutely fascinating. By the way, I think when you discuss religion on doubt, there is no doubt in my mind there is a living God and no doubt in my mind that the Lord, Christ, was sent by the Almighty. No doubt in my mind about that. When I am talking about doubts, I am talking about the doubts that an individual struggles with in his or her life. That is important for you to make sure you get that part of the dialog correct, if you do not mind. Thank you. Got it? Everybody got it correct? All right. Thank you. What are your plans this weekend? Like Stretch, I am on the injured reserve list from running, so I will be mountain biking. I think Cat McKinnon is going come up from Austin. Oh, yes. And I will be fishing. I will be finishing my book, Peter the Great, by Robert K. Massie. Some of you old-timers have probably already read it. I am just now have you read it? Getting ready for the next Russia trip. Have you read it? No. I like when you said old-timer, and you looked at Steve . He probably had read it, and I was not going to look at Ann , of course, I am too polite. We will have briefings. Condi is coming to spend the night; Hadley will be spending a night there. We will start briefing the Sharon visit Sunday night. And then we will obviously greet the Prime Minister and then head off to Fort Hood on Tuesday morning and work on that speech probably Monday evening. Looking forward to getting back down there again. I may do a little cedar work depends on how sleepy the crew is. I will be fishing, just down the Bosque River. Really? Yes. I am sleeping at the Side Oats Ranch tonight. Tell them hi. Middle Fork has got some water in it. They do. The Middle Fork comes down to my place. Does it come down to you from his, or goes the other way? I think it comes down, does not it? Yes, I think he is west of me, so it is coming down toward Waco. The Middle Fork feeds into the Brazos. Consider yourself lucky you get to go down to Texas. I am delighted. You are not grousing about it, are you? Oh, no, no, no. I am sorry I missed Easter. I was at home for that. It may be I hope I have not heard, but it may be that the wildflowers, are they out yet? They say there is going to be a spectacular bluebonnet season this year; I mean spectacular. Is that in honor of the Baylor women's basketball team? I called, as a matter of fact, on the airplane flying to Rome, I called the coach, Kim Mulkey-Robertson, a fine person. I had met her before when she brought you all saw her, at least if you were on the pool, right? Let us see anyway, she was with the Midway girls softball team when they came out, the national champs softball team. Her daughter is a player on it, and so she came out with the parents. But she was one excited lady. And she did a heck of a job. Blew them out. They have got a great team. I am looking forward to welcoming them to the White House.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone1", "title": "Interview With Reporters Aboard Air Force One", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-reporters-aboard-air-force-one-1", "publication_date": "08-04-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 332, "text": "UCSD, University of California-San Diego, was the one you named today from this area? That is right. They have a project that will use composite materials that were part of the Stealth aircraft development to build and repair bridges. There are others; let me just tell you where the others are in southern California. We have one in Redondo Beach that Cal State-Fullerton was involved in; one at Newport Beach with Hughes Electric, G.M. Hughes; one in Torrance-two in Torrance. So if you want to mention any of them, we can. Joining us now to talk about what is called the first wave of the Technology Reinvestment Program grant is the author of the plan, more or less, president of the United States, ENTITY. Thanks for joining us today to talk about what we here in San Diego call the defense conversion. Can you give us kind of a short definition or explanation of what it is you want to accomplish here? Yes, we are trying to take the capacities, the skills, the technologies that were developed in the big defense build-up of the 1980's, and instead of just letting those technologies and the abilities of those people go to waste, we want to give them a chance to be used in the commercial sector in a way that helps both national defense by keeping that skill and that technology alive and helps to rebuild the domestic economy and to create jobs. Today we announced the first of what will be four announcements between now and the end of November in the technology research project, which involved 41 projects from California to Maine from former defense contractors or current defense contractors using technologies in defense for domestic purposes. In San Diego, the University of San Diego and Muller International and a company called Trans-Science Corporation are using the composite materials developed for the Stealth aircraft to build and repair bridges. And they are working on a bridge in San Diego now. And this is just one of, as I said, over 40 projects. California got a large number of these projects but so did several other States that have been hurt by base closing and defense cutbacks. They were all given out on the merits, I assure you, and now what the companies have to do is to negotiate with our defense conversion projects to make sure that the Government and the companies all put up a fair amount of money. Then they will start hiring people and going to work. We are very excited about it. ENTITY, some claim that if it was a good idea, a strong company would run with that idea. Do you run a risk of propping up a bad company or a bad idea? There may be some risk of that, but it is not much of a risk. After all, in terms of the potential expenditure of money, this is mostly seed money to get these projects started. A lot of these companies are quite well established, and these technologies have proven merit in the defense area. This is the sort of thing that our competitors in Germany, Japan, countries with lower unemployment rates and higher investment rates than we do, they do these things all the time. We know the technology, the skills, the ideas to make the conversion, but we are not organized for it. This simply helps us to organize to make this conversion from a defense-based to a domestic economy. It will create a lot of jobs. And I think that it will be among the most efficient Government programs ever seen because, keep in mind, we do not put up all the money; if the other side does not put up half the money, the project does not get done. So, that is a pretty strong incentive to make sure whatever is done is a good project. ENTITY, UCSD's $21 million-granted, nobody wants to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is really a drop in the bucket when you consider what San Diego has lost so far in cutbacks in the military and defense jobs. It is, but that is the point. It starts up a new business enterprise for which there must be a market in the private sector. We believe there is a huge market. That is why all these things are helping to start up a process. Keep in mind, too, that San Diego gained 5,200 jobs in the last round of base closings and consolidations, so those new jobs will be coming into your area over the next couple of years, and that will help some also. ENTITY, thank you very much for joining us today.

{"id": 75, "text": "How are we going to run this thing? Are you guys all taking turns? Yes, we plotted it all out. We did. And I think we all feel, not surprisingly, a question -- the first question would be what lessons are you taking out of the experience of passing the stimulus bill in terms of how you will deal with congressional Democrats, congressional Republicans, and for that matter, the country, in moving forward your agenda. What did you learn from this experience? Well, first of all, let me describe for you the process and the substance of how we put this package together. And then I will be happy to talk about the politics of it. During the transition I came in, and my first charge to my economic team was canvas economists across the political spectrum and present to me as diverse a set of views as possible, and a set of recommendations in terms of how we can get the economy moving again and put people back to work. Now, at that point when we started, we had not yet seen December's job report, January's job report, but we knew that things seemed to be worsening rather than getting better. Almost to a economist, there was a consensus that we needed a large stimulus package not as the silver bullet to solve our economic problems, but as a necessary component to solving our economic problems, and in terms of scope, that we were going to need something between $600 billion and $1.3 trillion. That was the range that was presented to us. There also was consensus among economists that the best approach to spending that much money and getting the stimulus out of it was to diversify a little bit, so have a tax cut component -- there was a generally strong feeling that tax cuts targeted at people who were most likely to spend would have the biggest impact; a state fiscal relief component, or a countercyclical spending component, so everything from -- food stamps to unemployment insurance -- again, stuff that would be spent out quickly and, in some cases, help prevent a worsening of layoffs and a spiral downward. And then a third component of infrastructure. Now, each of these components had pluses and minuses. For example, tax cuts, you can get them out quick, but the general view is that you do not necessarily see a dollar of spending by consumers for every tax cut they receive. Infrastructure, you get probably the biggest multiplier effect -- for every dollar you spend you might get $1.5 worth of demand out there, but necessarily you cannot get all those infrastructure projects done within a two-year time frame and the start-ups may be longer. So our whole goal was to provide a framework for Congress that presented the best mix based on the best available information that we'd gotten. I raise this because I think that some of the critics ended up fastening on this pet project or this program that they suggested was not stimulative; in fact, it would be hard to find economists who would argue that the guts of the program, the core of what just passed the House and hopefully will pass the Senate while we are in the air or shortly after we land is not pretty well designed to get the economy moving again. And one last point -- one last goal that we set out, and that was if we were going to spend this much money, our number one priority being to get jobs in place and to get the economy moving again, would not it also be helpful for us to make sure that we laid some made -- that we made an investment in longterm economic growth -- that we put a down payment on things that have been deferred for too long? So if we are going to spend money on education, then can we try to introduce some reform elements into the education portion? If we are going to tackle health care by making COBRA more affordable, can we also look at health IT as a way of driving down costs over the long term? How much infrastructure can we design around clean energy? Now, again, there is some tensions on that front because some of the most innovative down payments might not spend out in two years. One of the things I was pushing for hard was can we get the entire smart grid done, and it turns out that actually, historically, a lot of these lines are laid by private companies, so we could not spend as much as you would think on that part of infrastructure, but we have kick-stared it in the package. All right, anyway, that is all the substance of it. Now, in terms of what I have learned on the politics of it, I think what I have learned is that I have got a great team because we moved a very big piece of legislation through Congress in record time. And that was not easy to do. And I think the end product is not a hundred percent of what we would want, but it is a very good start on moving things forward. I made every effort to reach out to Republicans early to get their input and to get they buy-in. I think that there were some senators and House members who have a sincere philosophical difference with the idea of any government role in boosting demand in the economy. They do not believe in Keynes and they are still fighting FDR. And no matter what we did, said, whatever the process was, they just do not agree that this is the best prescription. And I think we can disagree without being disagreeable on that front. I also think that there was a decision made that was political and tactical on their part where they said, you know what, if we can enforce conformity among our ranks then it will invigorate our base and will potentially give us some political advantage, either short term or long term. And whether that is a smart strategy, I think you should ask them. The last point I would make, though, is that given the urgency of the situation right now, my consistent goal throughout this process is: Are we getting the most immediate, most effective relief possible to American families who are losing their jobs, losing their homes, losing their health care? I welcome Republican participation in that process, but ultimately I am answerable to the American people. And my determination was to get it done, and I think that we are going to get it done. Just to follow up -- well, I was going to ask, do you think you let it hang out there too long, getting attacked and let the House -- there was this effort to split you and the House, and Republicans are saying, oh, Obama is not really for this. Did you leave that out there too long to create a -- Look, I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that once a decision was made by the Republican leadership to have a party-line vote -- a decision that I think occurred before I met with them -- then I am not sure that there was a whole host of things that we were going to do that was going to make a difference. But again, my bottom line was not how pretty the process was; my bottom line was am I getting help to people who need it. Going forward, each and every time we have got an initiative I am going to go to both Democrats and Republicans and I am going to say, here is my best argument for why we need to do this. I want to listen to your counter-arguments; if you have got better ideas, present them. We will incorporate them into any plans that we make, and we are willing to compromise on certain issues that are important to one side or the other in order to get stuff done. There are 535 members of Congress; they are not potted plants. Their job is to represent their constituents and they have got ideas, too. So I am not interested in bulldozing them. On the other hand, I am answerable to the American people in an emergency economy. And what I will not do is to engage in Washington tit-for-tat politics and spend a lot of time worrying about those games to the detriment of getting programs in place that are going to help people. ENTITY, you got no votes in the House on the stimulus package and only a tiny number of Republicans in the Senate. Is there any way to say that the Republicans made a good-faith effort to function in a bipartisan way on the stimulus package? Well, look, as I said, I do not want to question the sincerity of some of the Republicans who opposed this plan. They just may have a different theory about how the economy works. Now, I have to say that given that they were running the show for a pretty long time prior to me getting there and that their theory was tested pretty thoroughly and it is landed us in the situation where we have got over a trillion dollars' worth of debt and the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, I think I have a better argument in terms of economic thinking. But, again, I do not question their sincerity. I do think that over time, as we keep on reaching out, and as I think the American people express their view that we need to start actually doing something about jobs, housing, health care, education, and so forth, that there will be some counterveiling pressures to work in a more constructive way. Do you think -- I will just close, maybe, this subject - - has this experience changed your expectation of what you might be able to achieve in terms of Republican support, or the way you will seek it? Has it changed what you think is possible? You know, I am an eternal optimist and -- that does not mean I am a sap -- -- so my goal is to assume the best, but prepare for a whole range of different possibilities in terms of how Congress reacts. Keep in mind, I do think that because we had to lead with a recovery package that touched on sort of a -- one of the core differences between Democrats and Republicans, this particular debate may have exaggerated some of these issues. And when we start talking about how we are going to manage the budget, or when we start talking about how we are going to approach entitlements, or when we start talking about foreign policy, that there is going to be greater flexibility. But we will have to see. ENTITY, you had to give up quite a bit to really -- in order to try to make a deal with the Republicans. What would you like to restore first? Well, look, first of all, let us get this package passed. I think it is a great start. And -- well, if you think about the number of jobs that are going to be created, the amount of progress that we can make on, let us say energy, for example, where we are doubling alternative fuels, where we are going to be retrofitting buildings to make them energy efficient, where we are providing a whole host of incentives to start innovation in new technologies; if you look at what we are going to be doing on education and teacher training and encouraging new approaches; when you look at what we are doing on health care, where we do have money now to do what every expert says, Republican and Democrat, says we should have done 10 years ago or 15 years ago, and get everybody's medical records in digital form; when you think about the roads and the bridges that are going to be repaired -- there is a lot of stuff in there that I think is going to be very helpful. And that is before you start talking about the immediate relief provided to families that are hurting. Now, I think that some of the changes that were made were - - you can argue either way at the margins. I think that there were some legitimate concerns about programs that were initially in the House bill that I actually support as policy, but were not designed to boost the economy. I will say that that accounted for between one and two percent of the overall package. And this is an example of where -- somebody was asking me about sincerity -- I think that from a purely political tactical point of view, I understand why somebody would gin up the National Mall or family planning. From a practical point of view, that was not remotely close to being the core of the bill. I do think that we probably could have done more on the education innovation front. I think we could have done more with some of the health care reforms that would lower costs. I think that if you ask governors, Republican and Democrat, around the country, about their budgets, they would argue that cuts in help to the states is going to put them in a very bad bind, particularly if the economy does not turn around fairly soon. So those are all issues where again, I might have designed it a little bit differently, but ultimately this is a framework that is going to create between 3 and 4 million jobs. And that was my bottom line. I think we are going to get some good investments and I think it is an enormous accomplishment. I wanted to ask a quick question. You often -- on Monday night, for example, you talked about the catastrophe that could happen -- of course we do not know for sure what will work -- what does catastrophe look like? I do not have a crystal ball, and I do not think anybody does, but I think that you can imagine very easily a scenario in which we duplicate what happened in Japan in the '90s, where we paper over core problems in the banking system. Despite some efforts at stimulus, we never fully get private credit flowing again, and the economy contracts severely and then sort of limps along for a very long period of time. Keep in mind, though, that even in that scenario, Japan had an awful lot of foreign currency reserves, they had a surplus from a positive trade balance. And the United States was pulling a world economy along. In this situation you have got all the economies around the world, even including China, decelerating at a fairly rapid rate. So if what happened in Japan is duplicated here in the United States, there is nobody else to help drive the engine of growth, you could end up seeing an even more protracted and prolonged worldwide contraction. And I think that would have a severe impact on our quality of life. Could I ask you on that, the reaction -- put aside Wall Street's reaction to Secretary Geithner's plan, and lots of, to use your phrase, economists left and right said that they were, A, concerned that there were not enough details there and why did you put it out then, but, B, substantively, that it may not go far enough and that there may be -- in order to avoid Japan you might have to do Sweden -- could you talk about -- Let me, first of all, emphasize that the recovery package was critical to help families right now. Unemployment insurance extensions, health care through a COBRA that is affordable, some immediate job creation -- those are very important. That is only one leg of the stool. As I said in my press conference, the second leg of the stool is getting credit flowing again. And what the first round of TARP accomplished was to avert potential -- I hate to use the word again, but potential catastrophe in the banking system. I mean, things could have melted down much worse. Because of a lack of clarity, consistency, transparency, what you did not see was a market rebound and credit moving the way it needs to. So the credit markets still are not functioning the way they should. Now, this is a hard problem, and that is why I said, I think on Nightline the day that Tim Geithner spoke, there are certain market participants who think that there is some painless, quick fix here. There is not . Because what happened was that you had banks making bets, leveraging $30 off of one dollar of subprime assets; that was duplicated throughout the system, and deleveraging, sort of working through all those bad debts is going to be really tough. Now, we started talking about this, by the way, in transition as well, and so along parallel tracks, even as we were working on getting the recovery package done, we were also talking about how do we get credit flowing to home owners; how do we make sure that we are getting small businesses the resources they need; how do we make sure the banks trust each other in terms of lending, and even blue-chip companies are able to shed corporate debt, so they can make payroll and keep people working. And as you pointed out, sort of along the spectrum there are two ways of handling this. There is the Japan model -- as I said, they sort of papered things over, never really bit the bullet, took their medicine, and so you never got credit flowing the way it should have and the bad assets in their system just corroded the economy for a long period of time Sweden, in contrast, took over their banks and took out the bad assets and then resold the good banks, the fixed banks to private hands. And they were up and running pretty soon. And as I said when I was asked about this the other day, you can make a good argument for the Swedish model, except for this fact: They only had a handful of banks. We have got thousands of banks. The scale, the magnitude of what we are dealing with is much bigger. We have got global financial markets that are reacting in all sorts of unpredictable ways. And so what we have to do is to we have to pull the Band-Aid off so we do not duplicate what happened in Japan. But we have also got to make sure that in pulling the Band-Aid off we do not just start doing so much damage that things end up getting much, much worse. Finding that sweet spot is what we have been working on for the last several weeks and what Tim Geithner is going to continue to be working on over the next weeks, months, probably through then end of this year. So are you saying that -- do you foresee a point where it would be necessary to follow the Swedish model and have the government take over some of these banks? Or is that -- are you ruling that out as impractical -- even at a point down the road? My absolute goal is to make sure that our financial system is set and that we get credit flowing again, that homeowners, small businesses and large businesses will get -- invest and create jobs and get this economy going again. I am going to be very practical in terms of how to approach it. What we want to do is to make sure that we get this right on the front end. What Tim Geithner did was to provide a framework. He is presenting then a timeline of how this is going to roll out over the next several months: When do we start applying these stress tests to the banks; opening up their books; making sure that everybody knows for sure exactly what is going on in there; structuring plans to attract private capital to help deal with some of these weaker institutions. Some of the smaller institutions that do not pose systemic risks, if it turns out that they are in really, really bad shape, then we may have to reevaluate how we approach some of those institutions. He is also working the Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC to open up lines of credit that immediately provide some relief to small businesses and consumers. There are a whole bunch of credit markets, like student loans or credit cards, that are locked up right now, but actually the underlying assets in these securitized markets are not that bad, so we may just have to use a variety of different tools to give private investors some confidence on that front. But here is the bottom line: We will do what works. It is going to take time to lay out every aspect of this plan and there are going to be certain aspects of any plan that was designed which will require reevaluation and then have some experimentation -- if that does not work then you do something else. What I am confident about is that the basic framework that we have put forward is the right one, and that it balances a whole host of issues, including, by the way, the issue of making sure the taxpayers are not just carrying the whole freight on this thing, and that we are sharing -- that institutions on Wall Street are sharing the burden of cleaning up this mess. We want to help because -- not because I am particularly happy about how Wall Street has been running its businesses, but because if we do not fix the banking system and the credit markets, then businesses cannot make payroll and we continue to see pain among ordinary Americans. On the other hand, I think that folks on Wall Street have to understand that these burdens have to be shared, and so restrictions on executive compensation, transparency, making sure that shareholders are more effectively involved, all those things we are taking into account. And by the way, the market is not always going to like some of those decisions, because ideally what they'd like to do, they'd like to continue business as usual and not pay a price for a whole bunch of really big mistakes that were made. Just to follow up, if I hear you correctly you are saying that you could reach a point where you have to go further in terms of the government. If what you are doing now does not work -- I think what you can say is I will not allow our financial system to collapse. And we are going to do whatever is required to get credit flowing again so that companies and consumers can do their business and we can get this economy back on track. ENTITY, if I could ask you about infrastructure, You have got infrastructure spending in the stimulus package. The need is much faster than that and the money is tight. Do you anticipate any significant further additions in federal infrastructure spending in the reasonably near future, and are you making plans to establish an infrastructure bank? Well, number one, we have got the transportation reauthorization bill that is going to be coming up. So one thing to keep some perspective about on the recovery package is this is supposed to provide a jolt to the economy above and beyond what we are doing already in the federal budget. And so I expect that Secretary LaHood, working with the various transportation committees are going to be moving forward on a transportation bill. I would like to see some long-term reforms in how transportation dollars flow, and I will give you just a couple of examples. I think right now we do not do a lot of effective planning at the regional level when it comes to transportation. That is hugely inefficient. Not only does it probably consume more money in terms of getting projects done, but it also ends up creating traffic patterns, for example, that are really hugely wasteful when it comes to energy use. If we can start building in more incentives for more effective planning at the local level, that is not just good transportation policy, it is good energy policy. So we will be working with transportation committees to see if we can move in that direction. The idea of an infrastructure bank I think make sense -- the idea that we get engineers, and not just elected officials, involved in thinking about and planning how we are spending these dollars. I may get some objections from my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, on the Hill about that, but I think there should be some way for us to -- just think how can we rationalize the process to get the most bang for the buck, because the needs are massive and we cannot do everything, and if it is estimated that just on infrastructure alone it would cost a couple trillion dollars to get our roads, bridges, sewer systems, et cetera, up to snuff, and we know we are not going to have that money, then it would be nice if we said here are the 10 most important projects and let us do those first, instead of maybe doing the 10 least important projects but the ones that have the most political pull. Can you do that without an infrastructure bank? I think that an infrastructure bank is important potential tool for getting that done. As I said, there is probably going to be some resistance that does not fall along partisan lines, but rather has to do with legislators being understandably protective about their ability to influence these decisions. ENTITY, when you see the market plunge, if you will, after Tim Geithner's announcement, or after congressional action this week, this makes the public like me nervous. What do you tell them? You are famous for keeping your cool through times of negative turns and all, and radiating confidence. What do you tell people about market reactions? What I tell them is, is that the market has been volatile and will be volatile for a while because there is a lot of uncertainty out there, but I am not planning based on a one-day market reaction. In fact, you can argue that a lot of the problems we are in have to do with everybody planning based on one-day market reactions, or three-month market reactions, and as a consequence, nobody was taking the long view. My job is to help the country take the long view, to make sure that not only are we getting out of this immediate fix but we are not repeating the same cycle of bubble and bust over and over and over again; that we are not having the same energy conversation 30 years from now that we had 30 years ago; that we are not talking about the state of our schools in the exact same ways we were talking about them in the 1980s; and that at some point we say, you know what, if we are spending more money per capita on health care than any nation on Earth, then you'd think everybody would have coverage and we would see lower costs for average consumers and we'd have better outcomes. So my goal is to say let us use this crisis as an opportunity to think long term, and let us see this as a wake-up call to make America more competitive. The one other thing I'd say to people, though, is we have been through tougher times before. I mean, in some ways, part of this is generational. I think that -- you know, I am 47-48 -- getting older by the day -- getting older by the day -- - You are going on 68 -- So I am 48 years old. The last very bad recession we had in '81-'82 I was still in college. So for a huge number of people out there, they are just not accustomed to seeing a bad economy with really high unemployment and very bearish markets. But you know what, we went through this in the '80s, and that was combined with unbelievable inflation. In the '70s, right after the oil shots, we had an economy that was limping along, and I do not have to tell you what happened in the '30s -- what we are going through now is nothing compared to what our grandparents went through during the Great Depression. So I think that we have to take it seriously and I am constantly trying to thread the needle between making sure people understand this is really serious and we have got to take some drastic action, but also letting people know we have been through tougher times, America is incredibly resilient. We have -- I forget who had the quote -- and I do not even know the exact quote, but to paraphrase, basically we always wait until we are in absolute crisis and then somehow we figure out a way to get the political process working to yank ourselves out of it. It would be nice if we had a political system that could anticipate these things and deal with them in a more regular fashion. Is part of that balance between, look, this is serious, but not wanting to scare people to death -- what -- everyday Americans, what should they do? I do not think they know what to do. George Bush said go out and shop. Here is what I think people have to do. I think people have to continue to have confidence that the same productive capacity that we had before is still there; our kids still need to go to school and still need to buy computers and still need to eat; people still need to drive cars and still need to get to their jobs. There was over-building in the housing market, much like -- there is sort of a parallel to what was happening in the financial markets, but housing prices have fallen to the point where you are going to start seeing, starting some places quicker, but some places later, that existing inventory absorbed. New young families are coming online and they are going to need places to live. And over time as the population grows you are going to start seeing housing prices stabilize. So -- What creative ways -- I mean, things that have not been thought of yet that can be done -- for example, you have got GIs coming home from overseas; you have got empty houses in Florida with weeds growing up in the driveway. Is anybody thinking outside the box? Absolutely we are thinking outside the box. This is where the political debate is joined, and I am going to keep on making the case that government action in these circumstances is entirely appropriate and not at all inconsistent with the primacy of the free market and capitalism. I have no interest in expanding government, contrary to what some critics might say -- -- quote of the day. I do not . I have an interest in fixing the problem. In fact, keep in mind that one of the exercises that I am going through right now is how do we set up a long-term budget that is sustainable. I inherited a trillion-dollar-plus budget. That is a structural budget that was engineered by some of the very critics of this package. Now, I would love nothing more than to be able to walk into the presidency, roll up my sleeves and just start paring away at that budget because everything had been taken care of. We did not have deteriorating infrastructure. Families had health care at affordable prices. The schools were working and we had enough teachers, and the banks were fat and happy and lending money and people had jobs, and we did not have two wars going on. And then I could -- I would say, you know what, give me just one of these problem, I will take them. Unfortunately, what they handed off was all of these problems simultaneously. So what we are going to do is to work with anybody who wants to work with us constructively to solve the short-term problem of putting people back to work, and the recovery package was part of that. We are going to get a financial system that gets credit flowing again. We are going to put forward some regulatory architecture that ensures that we do not see these kinds of systemic risks again. We are going to put forward a housing plan as part of the overall financial approach that we are taking that just provides some immediate relief to people who are on the brink of losing their homes but have been doing everything right. And some of this is going to cost money short term and we are going to try to pull off the hat trick of, at the same time, starting to chip away at our enormous long-term budget deficit. Can I ask you then, talk a little about your priorities for the rest of the year and whether the large cost of this -- what you have got to invest in this stimulus package changes your view about whether you can move forward on some of them, particularly your health care plan, which does have a substantial cost. This will be the last one so we can -- Can I ask one more after -- thanks. My priorities for the rest of the year. Number one is to get the right structure for the successor to TARP; spending the $300-some billion that has already been authorized as wisely as possible, and injecting transparency and trust into the financial system. Having a housing program that provides relief to people who are at risk of losing their homes. Financial regulations that ensure that the crisis does not happen again. A innovative and aggressive push for health care reform that focuses not just on access but also on costs, and trying to just provide relief to working families. And a push for an energy policy that puts us on a path to sustainability. You asked given what we inherited, are we going to be able to get all this done. Some of these reforms do not cost money. They will still be heavy political lifts because there are philosophical arguments about how to approach it. Some of these problems are very complicated. Health care is a classic situation where it may cost money on the front end and save enormous money on the back end and what we are going to have to figure out is what can we do now to start getting that ball rolling, because the longer we put that off, the worse off we are financially. Medicare and Medicaid on their current trajectory cannot be sustained. And the only way I think we are going to fix it is if we see those two problems in the broader contest of bending the curve down on health care inflation. The problem is not just demographics. Peter Orszag, before he joined us, loved to make this presentation -- you sat through the chart -- that, yes, people are getting older, but that is not the problem. The problem is health care costs going up 6, 7, 8, 10 percent a year. Now, those are the things that need to get done. I should add one more thing and that is a budget process that starts bending the deficit curve down. Some of these -- I think that all these goals are complementary. I also think that the American people understand we will not get everything done overnight. The U.S. government and the U.S. economy are enormous ocean liners, they are not speedboats. So what we will do this year is to try to get them on the right trajectory and hopefully that means at the end of my term you will look back and you will say we are at a different place than we would have been had we not made these changes. The one message I want to send to the American people is that on all these fronts my consistent bottom line is how do we make sure that the American people can work, have a decent income, look after their kids, and we can grow the economy. That is my criteria. I do not have an ideological agenda in how we are approaching it. My second message is to Congress: We cannot afford to get bogged down in some of the bad habits that have accumulated during the process over the last several years. I wonder -- you speak more about history I think than most politicians, maybe even than most presidents. And you have also been talking a lot about Lincoln. But you seem to put yourself in historical context a lot. And so sort of in a way, I just want to ask, when you think about this, how much do you think you make history or history makes you, or how much do you think Lincoln made history or history made him? That was a profoundly abstract and philosophical question that you asked. Which you talk about all the time, I believe. Got a couple more hours on the flight -- Look, I think that there are certain moments in history where big change is possible. It is not a certainty, but it is possible -- at certain inflection points. And I think that those changes can be for the good, or they can be for the ill. And leadership at those moments can help determine which direction that wave of change goes. I think it is very hard to -- for any single individual or politician to unleash historical momentum on its own. But I think when that historical wave is there, I think you can help guide it. Good answer. Are we in one of those moments? Yes. Yes. I firmly believe that. We are in one of those moments? I think we are -- which is part of what makes it scary sometimes, but is also what should make people determined and excited because I think that we can really solve some problems that have been there for a long time and we just could not get the collective focus to tackle them. Now may be one of those moments where we can. All right, guys.

{"id": 856, "text": "It is been my honor to welcome to Washington and to confer with President Azcona of Honduras. And we have had extremely useful discussions today. We both expressed our appreciation for the positive and solid relationship that our two countries enjoy. We reviewed recent developments in Central America, including the summit meeting this past weekend. President Azcona and I are in full agreement on the necessity of working for greater economic growth in Central America and the importance of democratic institutions to the cause of peace in the region. I reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to cooperate closely with Honduras, both in helping to build its economy and in bolstering its democracy. I expressed to President Azcona my personal thanks and that of the American people for his government's responsible stand on regional issues. Our two governments share a serious concern over the threat to peace, stability, and freedom posed by the Communist regime in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Communists, with extensive Soviet and Cuban support, persist in repressing their own population and in backing the subversion of their democratic neighbors. This endangers all of Latin America and ultimately the United States as well. In this regard, I underscored to the President our promise to stand by Honduras in defense of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, as is in accordance with our reciprocal international rights and obligations. A joint communique will be issued today reiterating this mutual commitment. President Azcona and I agree that our countries and the other democracies in the region must act together to end the conflict that plagues Central America, but it is not just up to us. Securing regional peace will require an end to Communist aggression as well as national reconciliation and democratization within Nicaragua. Honduras has been diligent and persistent in its pursuit of a comprehensive and verifiable solution within the framework of the Contadora negotiations, and, Mr. President, you have our support in these efforts. The United States continues to believe that a realistic and enforceable agreement, based on the full implementation of the Contadora Document of Objectives, is one way to bring peace to Central America. And finally, it was a great personal pleasure to meet President Azcona. I look forward to continuing our work in the same spirit of friendship and respect that was so evident in our meeting today. So, Mr. President, we thank you for coming. Godspeed on your way home. President Azcona. It has been a great pleasure to talk with President Reagan. I believe that these exchanges of views, held in a climate of great cordiality and frankness, are always beneficial, because they lead to greater understanding and a better relationship between our governments and peoples. With President Reagan, we have reviewed the various aspects of the harmonious bilateral relations between our two countries. I am happy to say that in the economic field he was receptive to the points I made to him. So, I am certain that his great country will give broad support to the measures which my government is taking to reactivate the Honduran economy and reduce our present high unemployment levels, as a complement to Honduran short- and medium-term efforts, all without neglecting our security needs. I have told President Reagan about the efforts we are making in Honduras to develop our country. In this context, I reiterated the fact that our government assigns the highest priority to foreign investment, while at the same time recognizing that at present we also require the participation of government and the cooperation of friendly countries, among which the United States is one of the closest. Because of the fact that we believe in the necessity of offering the foreign investor a climate of tranquillity, encouraging his participation in the effort being made by Hondurans to develop our country, and of offering him guarantees which ensure the protection of his legitimate rights, I have authorized the Foreign Minister to sign during this visit the treaty on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states. This treaty will provide the foreign investor in Honduras with access to international legal mechanisms of recognized impartiality and competence, which together with those offered by Honduran law will guarantee to him the full enjoyment of his rights. In the political field, we reaffirmed our identity as a regime governed by rule of law and based on the effective exercise of democracy and on respect for human rights. When we examined the situation in Central America, we noted with concern that conditions jeopardizing peace and security still exist. We agreed that major new efforts must be made to find a negotiated solution to the crisis, based on concrete actions for national reconciliation, on free and honest elections, on disarmament, and in general, on the creation of a climate in which freedom and security for all can guarantee the economic and social development of the peoples of Central America. To that end, it is necessary to conclude fully verifiable, juridical arrangements among the Central American States. President Reagan reiterated to me that, in accordance with the special security relationship which exists between our two countries, as long as grave threats to Honduras security and to the stability of our institutions persist, the Government of the United States will be prepared, in the case of armed aggression against Honduras, to render it any necessary assistance which the Honduran Government may request. Finally, I would like to say how very gratified I am that in the course of this visit, the relations of friendship and cooperation which exist between Honduras and the United States have been strengthened within a framework of trust and mutual respect.

{"id": 680, "text": "Thank you very much, and good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, because this is the only time I am going to be before the press today, at the outset of my remarks I'd like to say a few things about the situation in Iraq. For more than 3 months, the United States and the international community have very patiently sought a diplomatic solution to Iraq's decision to end all its cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq's continued refusal to embrace a diplomatic, peaceful solution, its continued defiance of even more United Nations resolutions, makes it plainer than ever that its real goal is to end the sanctions without giving up its weapons of mass destruction program. The Security Council and the world have made it crystal clear now that this is unacceptable, that none of us can tolerate an Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity. Still, Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM. Just yesterday his own neighbors in the Arab world made it clear that this choice is his alone and the consequences, if he fails to comply, his alone in terms of responsibility. Now, let me say to all of you, this is a very good day for the United States. I want to thank Officer Sandra Grace from New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Detective Gary McLhinney from Baltimore for their service, for sharing their stories, for representing their organizations so well, for reminding us why all of those here have worked so hard to pass the laws that in a few moments I will sign, laws to help us honor the memory of law enforcement officers by helping to prevent the kind of gun-related crimes that took their lives and by supporting the families they leave behind. I'd also like to thank Secretary Rubin, Attorney General Reno, Director Magaw, the ATF, Assistant Secretary Johnson, and the others who are here from the Treasury and Justice Departments; Attorney General Curran from Maryland, who joined us today. And a special word of thanks to my good friend Senator Biden, who had to leave; and to Congressman Stupak; Congressman King, who spoke so well and did so much. And thank you, Congressman Fox, for joining us here today in celebration of the work you did that I hope you will be proud of all your life, sir. Thank you very much. This is a special day for me personally because I was attorney general of my own State. I was Governor for a dozen years. I have spent a lot of hours riding around in State police cars with officers. I have been to altogether too many funerals of law enforcement officials killed in the line of duty. And because I come from a small State, very often I knew these people well. I knew their families, their children, their circumstances. Just last weekend I went home to dedicate an airport, and the first people that came running up to me were the three State police officers who were assigned to work the event. And we stood there and relived a lot of old times. So this issue is very, very vivid. And I think, again, we should thank, especially, the Members of Congress who are here; the police officers; Gil Gallegos and the FOP; Thomas Nee and the National Association of Police Officers; Jerry Flynn, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers; Rich Gallo, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; Sam Cabral, the International Union of Police; and Debbie Geary from the Concerns of Police Survivors. I'd like to ask you all just to give them all another hand. Six years ago when I became ENTITY, one of my most urgent priorities was to put the Federal Government on the side of supporting our police officers and reducing the crime rate. At the time, the crime rate was on the rise; gangs, guns, and drugs were sweeping through our neighborhoods, terrorizing our families, cutting off the future of too many of our children. The thing that bothered me most when I was out around the country seeking the Presidency was that there were so many people who were full of hope and optimism for our country, but when it came to crime, they seemed almost to have given up, to have simply accepted the fact that a rising crime rate was a part of the price of the modern world. We were able to galvanize, all of us together, the energies of the American people to fight back. I never met a law enforcement officer who believed that a rising crime rate was inevitable. Every law enforcement officer I met believed that if we did the right things-if we were tough, yes, but tough was not enough; we had to be smart, too-that if we both punished people who should be punished and did the intelligent things to prevent crime from happening in the first place, that the crime rate could go down. And we passed in 1994 a historic crime bill, along with the Brady law, which among other things focused on community policing, aggressive prevention, and tougher penalties for violent repeat offenders. Now we are ahead of schedule and under budget in putting those 100,000 police on the street. We have gone after gangs and drugs with the full authority of Federal law. The Brady law has prevented about a quarter of a million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying firearms in the first place. Crime rates have fallen to a 25-year low. All across America, robbery is down; assault is down; murder is down. Respect for the law is on the rise. You can see it in little ways: fewer broken windows, less graffiti, cleaner streets in city after city after city. We must never forget that this victory was won, however, at a very high price for some of our law enforcement officials. We must never forget that police officers put on their uniforms, their badges, go to work every day knowing that that day could be their last, just by doing their jobs. Officer Bradley Arn served on the police force of St. Joseph, Missouri, for the last 7 years. He was a cop's cop. He patrolled the streets by day and worked his way through college by night. At 28, more than anything else, he wanted a better life for his wife and his 2-year-old twin daughters. On Tuesday, just a couple of days ago, he answered a distress call. A career criminal with a semiautomatic gun was terrorizing pedestrians. He responded to the call and was brutally gunned down. According to the police, the murderer had a deadly goal, quote, He wanted to hurt people in black-and-white cars wearing dark blue uniforms. Only the bravery of a fellow officer stopped the shooting spree. Every year there are too many police officers like Bradley Arn who make the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe. Not very long ago, I went up to the Capitol to honor the two police officers who were killed there. But we have to do more than build monuments to honor these people. We have to take action to prevent more needless tragic deaths, to work for those who have given their lives, and we have to take action to help families they leave behind. Two years ago we acted to provide college scholarships to the families of slain Federal law enforcement officers. Last year I pledged to make those same scholarships available to the families of State and local law enforcement officers and all public safety personnel. Today the legislation I sign honors that pledge. From now on, children and spouses of public safety officials who lose their lives in the line of duty will be able to apply for nearly $5,000 a year to pay for college tuition. I should point out that because virtually 100 percent of these families will be people on very modest incomes, they will be eligible also for the $1,500-a-year HOPE tax credit in the first 2 years of college, tax credits for the junior and senior year, expanded work-study programs, student loan programs-a student loan program which in most places allows them to pay the loan back as a percentage of the income that they earn-and the IRA that can be withdrawn from without penalty if the money's used to educate children. Most of that was the product of the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997. So we believe that if you look at this scholarship amount with the other things that have been passed in the last couple of years, as Peter King said, with overwhelming bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans working together on these issues, we will be able to protect the families and the children in their education and, in so doing, to honor the families and the law enforcement officers. It is the least we can do, and we have to do it. The bill I am about to sign was enacted in memory of U.S. Deputy Marshal William Degan, the most decorated deputy marshal in our history, who lost his life in a brutal shootout. His son, Billy Degan, was the first young person to benefit from this program. He recently graduated from Boston College, and he is here with us today. I'd like to ask him to stand and be recognized. Now, let me say just a brief word about the other legislation that I am going to sign; Mr. McLhinney talked about it. I am very proud that we are announcing these scholarships, but I cannot wait for the day when there is not a single person eligible for one. And I think that all of us should think about that. We know from painful experience that the most serious threat to the safety of police officers is a criminal armed with a weapon. Most police officers who lose their lives die from gunshot wounds. That is why we fought hard to keep guns off the streets, out of the hands of criminals. Brady background checks, as I said earlier, have prevented nearly a quarter of a million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying guns. Last week I announced a new step to close a loophole in the law that makes it easier for gun traffickers and criminals to avoid those checks at private gun shows. Make no mistake, the insidious practice of sidestepping our guns laws is not an idle threat. The city of Chicago recently concluded an undercover investigation of gun dealing. And as you saw, I hope, in the morning press, it has just filed suit alleging widespread practices by gun dealers in the Chicago area of selling guns illegally, counseling purchasers on how to evade firearms regulations, even selling guns to purchasers who say they intend to violate the law. We know legitimate gun dealers make every effort to comply with the law, but these charges in Chicago, if proven true, would demonstrate that at least some parts of the gun industry are helping to promote an illegal market in firearms. Such disrespect of our law endangers our people, and we will be watching the progress of this lawsuit closely. The ATF already vigorously investigates gun dealers and other gun traffickers who violate Federal laws. We will continue to work closely with State and local police to trace the crime guns back to their source and prevent illegal gun sales, especially to criminals and juveniles. But there is more we can do to protect our communities and police officers. You have heard a little bit of it from Detective McLhinney, but let me just say again, for several years now criminals who have used guns to commit their crimes have been subject to stiff mandatory penalties under Federal law and virtually every State law in the country. Today we go a step further. To protect our families and police officers, the bill I sign today will add 5 years of hard time to sentences of criminals who even possess firearms when they commit drug-related or violent crimes. Brandishing the firearm will draw an extra 7 years; firing it, another 10. A second conviction means a quarter century in jail. This is very important to try to reduce the threat of violent crime. Just a couple of days ago on Veterans Day, as I have every year since I have been ENTITY, I laid a wreath on the tomb of the unknown servicemen who gave their lives in service to our country. Today it is with great pride that I stand here with many of our law enforcement officers who every day are prepared to make the same sacrifice. Together, we are working to make America stronger in the 21st century. And again, let me thank you all. Now I'd like to ask the Members of Congress and Officers Grace and McLhinney and Mr. Degan, if you would come up here, I'd like for you to stand with us as we sign the bill, please.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigninglegislationeducationalassistanceforfamiliesslainofficersand", "title": "Remarks on Signing Legislation on Educational Assistance for Families of Slain Officers and on Penalties for Criminals Using Guns", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-legislation-educational-assistance-for-families-slain-officers-and", "publication_date": "13-11-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 651, "text": "Good morning. For too long, the people of Darfur have suffered at the hands of a government that is complicit in the bombing, murder, and rape of innocent civilians. My administration has called these actions by their rightful name: genocide. The world has a responsibility to help put an end to it. Last month, I announced that the United States was prepared to take new steps if the Government of Sudan did not allow the full deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force; if the Government did not begin living up to its many commitments, that the United States would act. I made clear that the time for promises was over, and that President Bashir had to do something to end the suffering. I held off implementing these steps because the United Nations believed that President Bashir could meet his obligations to stop the killing and would meet his obligations to stop the killing. Unfortunately, he has not met those obligations. President Bashir's actions over the past few weeks follow a long pattern of promising cooperation while finding new methods for obstruction. One day after I spoke, the military bombed a meeting of rebel commanders designed to discuss a possible peace deal with the Government. In the following weeks, he used his army and Government-sponsored militias to attack rebels and civilians in south Darfur. He is taken no steps to disarm these militias in the year since the Darfur Peace Agreement was signed. Senior officials continue to oppose the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping force. The result is that the dire security situation on the ground in Darfur has not changed. And so today, at my instruction, the United States has taken the steps I announced in April. First, the Department of Treasury is tightening U.S. economic sanctions on Sudan. With this new effort, the United States will more aggressively enforce existing sanctions against Sudan's Government. As part of this effort, the Treasury Department will add 30 companies owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan to its list of Specially Designated Nationals. We are also adding an additional company to the list, a company that has been transporting weapons to the Sudanese Government and militia forces in Darfur. All these companies are now barred from the U.S. financial system. It is a crime for American companies and individuals to knowingly do business with them. Second, we are targeting sanctions against individuals responsible for violence. These sanctions will isolate these persons by cutting them off from the U.S. financial system, barring them from doing business with any American citizen or company, and calling the world's attention to their crimes. Third, I am directing the Secretary of State to consult with the United Kingdom and other allies on a new United Nations Security Council resolution. This resolution will apply new sanctions against the Government of Sudan, against individuals found to be violating human rights or obstructing the peace process. It will impose an expanded embargo on arms sales to the Government of Sudan. It will prohibit the Sudanese Government from conducting any offensive military flights over Darfur. It will strengthen our ability to monitor and report any violations. At the same time, we will continue to push for U.N. support, including funding for the African Union peacekeepers, who remain the only force in Darfur that is protecting the people. We will continue to work for the deployment of a larger, hybrid force of AU and U.N. peacekeeping troops. We will continue to support the diplomacy of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We will continue to insist on the full implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement. We will continue to promote a broadly supported and inclusive political settlement that is the only long-term solution to the crisis in Darfur. America's commitment is clear. Since this conflict began, we have provided more than $1.7 billion in humanitarian and peacekeeping assistance for Darfur. We are the world's largest single donor to the people of Darfur. We are working for the day when the families of this troubled region are allowed to return safely to their homes and rebuild their lives in peace. The people of Darfur are crying out for help, and they deserve it. I urge the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, and all members of the international community to reject any efforts to obstruct implementation of the agreements that would bring peace to Darfur and Sudan. I call on President Bashir to stop his obstruction and to allow the peacekeepers in and to end the campaign of violence that continues to target innocent men, women, and children. And I promise this to the people of Darfur: The United States will not avert our eyes from a crisis that challenges the conscience of the world.

{"id": 807, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. I want to say a deep thank you from the bottom of my heart for your warm welcome to this wonderful State of sunshine here in Arizona. This is not a day for politics. This is a day for God, and since this is God's day I will leave very shortly and go with my old and longtime friend, Roy Elson, down to hear his preacher. He recommends him pretty highly, and I want to see if he is as good as the preacher I would have heard at Johnson City had I gone to church at home this morning. The reason I did not go to church at home this morning was because that beloved and venerable and wonderful man, than whom there is no other like him in all the world, Carl Hayden, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said to me, I think if you are going from your ranch in Texas to the sidewalks of San Francisco, you better not do it without stopping in Arizona. And when the Chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee makes a slight suggestion to the President, I hope the President is smart enough, and I know he loves Carl Hayden enough, that his suggestion is my command. So here I am. I want to thank Governor Fannin and Governor McFarland, my old boss that taught me so much and I love so much, and Edna, for coming out here to meet me. I want to tell you how grateful I am that Arizona furnishes one of our Cabinet members, Stewart Udall, and his lovely wife, and I am very proud of him. He is doing a wonderful job. We have done the best work on water and on power and on conservation that has been done any years since I have been in Washington. This has really been the conservation Congress. I want to thank Congressman Udall and Congressman Senner for coming here and welcoming me this morning. I am going to leave with Roy now in just a moment and I will not be seeing you any more, but I am coming back to these wonderful, happy, smiling faces, and this dry air and this fine sunshine because it is good and it invigorates you. It makes you count all your blessings and think about really how fortunate we are to be Americans. Now, all of you people out here have faith and have hope and have vision or you would not be in this Promised Land of Arizona. If you were afraid, and if you were doubters, and if you did not have vision, you would be in some ghost town somewhere instead of a State like Arizona and a city like Phoenix that is a Go-Go State and a Go-Go City. Do you know that by the year 2000--and we are really closer to the year 2000 now than we are to the year 1918 when we had our last war, even when I was born, 1908, we are pretty close to the year 2000--in the year 2000 Arizona's growth will be twice what it is in the rest of the Nation, the Nation's average. I do not want that to be repeated out where it gets back and drifts back over into Texas because some of my opponents over there will be saying I said Arizona is twice as good as Texas, and I do not want to say that. But I do say that your resources, your people, your management, your faith, your vision, your 20th century methods, your modern ideas, your great electronic industry and other industries that are coming to Arizona--that you will be growing twice as fast as the rest of the Nation in the year 2000. You have one problem, and it is a mighty big problem. No, no, now. I told you this was not going to be a political day and it is not. You get the wrong impression. Now wait a minute. You have one big problem, and that problem is--water. I never go down a corridor of the Capitol that Roy Elson does not catch me by my coattail and say, Cannot you help us with the problem of water in Arizona? I never went into the Appropriations Committee but what Carl Hayden did not catch me by the lapels of my coat. I am not that intimate with your other Senator, and I did not come out here to advertise him. But I do want to be fair and frank. He has talked to me a good many times about your water problem, and he wants to help on it. And he has wired me, urging me to take certain action in connection with water for Arizona. So it is not a partisan thing between Democrats and Republicans and Independents. We all have to find an answer to this water problem because that is going to be the answer to the 20th century. I will tell you what I am going to do about it. We are going to continue under the program that Stewart Udall has working now, and we are making progress on it every day. In your child's lifetime, if not in yours, and I think in yours, but in your child's lifetime we are going to be using the water from the sea to make the deserts bloom. Just think about what a wonderful land this will be when all the people are smiling and happy, when all the grass is green and we have nothing but a beautiful vista on the mountainside, where our cattle and our sheep can graze and our children can play. Now, that is the kind of a world that we want. I want to leave you with just one little thought for today. I am not your preacher, and I hope you all go on from here to church. But I want to just leave this thought with you: A great man named Abraham Lincoln, of another party, said, I trust, sir --when someone said to him, I trust, sir --meaning President Lincoln, that God is on our side, in a very hectic period in our national life, Lincoln replied, Well, let us hope that we are on God's side. What I want to say to you this morning is that all of you made great sacrifices to come out here and be courteous to me and be kind to me. I do not interpret it any other way. I think that you are really warm, and I hope not only that God is on our side, but I do hope that all of you are on God's side.

{"id": 688, "text": "Thank you very much. Peter, thank you very much for the introduction and the invitation. Laura and I are thrilled to be with you. We have just come from Texas. I spent this morning in San Antonio with some small-business owners. They were rightly concerned about our economy and their ability to get credit. They were wondering about a man they know who believes strongly in free markets and wondering why I promoted a significant piece of legislation to deal with what I believe and others believe is a significant problem, and that is the inability of credit to move as freely as we want. And I told them, if I thought that the problem would be contained only to Wall Street, I would have taken a particular point of view, but I told them I was concerned about them-just like I am concerned about you-and therefore proposed with the Congress a big rescue plan to deal with a big problem. I believe that this plan will work over time. I signed the bill on Friday. It is going to take time for the Treasury Department to put a plan in place that will not waste your money and that will achieve the objective. I believe in the long run this economy is going to be just fine. It is a resilient economy; it is a productive economy with good workers. This is a reminder that we have been through tough times before, and we are going to come through this just fine. And so I am telling my fellow citizens, like the three people I had coffee with there in San Antonio, that this plan is big for a reason. And the plan is going to take time to implement. And I-in the meantime, I told them to keep selling their products and working hard. So I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come and talk about judges, but before I did so I wanted to share with you my morning. And I am sure you hear the same thing; people are just wondering, are these banks going to freeze up? And my answer is, we got a plan to deal with it. And we got a plan to deal with judges too. It is something I have been implementing for 712 years. And so today I want to thank Peter and Chip Miller-happens to be the president of the Cincinnati lawyers chapter of the mighty Federalist Society; Fred Finks, the president of Ashland University; Gene Meyer, the president of the Federalist Society, for giving me a chance to come and talk about the judiciary. I appreciate Ed Meese, former Attorney General, for joining us; Paul Clement. The former secretary of State of Ohio-thanks for coming, Mr. Secretary. And thank you all. I understand there are members of the Federalist Society who are viewing this program from afar, over the Internet. So we welcome you via the wonders of modern technology. Before Oliver Wendell Holmes took his seat on the Supreme Court, he met a supporter who wished him well in his new duties. The supporter expressed satisfaction that Holmes would be going to Washington to administer justice. Holmes replied, Do not be too sure. I am going there to administer the law. Holmes was trying to make clear what he believed was the proper role of judges: to apply the laws as written and not to advance their own agendas. He knew that it was up to elected officials, not appointed judges, to represent the popular will. Our Founders gave the judicial branch enormous power. It is the only branch of Government whose officers are unelected. That means judges on the Federal bench must exercise their power prudently, cautiously, or some might even say, conservatively. And that means that the selection and confirmation of good judges should be a high priority for every citizen. We have seen the profound impact that judges can have on the daily lives of every citizen. We saw the power of judges in 2002, when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because it contained the words under God. We saw the power of judges in the Kelo decision, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court that ruled that governments could seize people's homes for private development. The government decided the seizure was for the greater good. We saw the power of judges in Boumediene v. Bush. There, a 5-4 majority rejected the carefully crafted procedures Congress established for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in response to a prior Supreme Court decision. And for the first time, the Court awarded foreign terrorists held overseas legal rights previously reserved for American citizens. Recently we have also seen the important role of judges in the rulings of a very different 5-4 majority. We saw this last year, when five members of the Supreme Court upheld a law banning the grisly practice of partial-birth abortion. We saw it again this June, when that same slender majority stood up for the plain meaning of our Constitution and upheld the rights of citizens under the Second Amendment. The lesson should be clear to every American : Judges matter. And that means the selection of good judges should be a priority for all of us. I appreciate that many people listening today and here in this room have worked hard to recruit more Americans to this cause. This work is in all our interests, but the truth of the matter is, the belief in judicial restraint is shared by the vast majority of American citizens. A lot has happened since 2000, yet I can still remember the heated debate over the kinds of judges Presidents should appoint. One group said that judges ought to look at the Constitution as a document that grows with our country and our history. This concept of a living Constitution gives unelected judges wide latitude in creating new laws and policies without accountability to the people. And then there was another side, which I happened to be a part of, that said we needed judges who believed that the Constitution means what it says. When asked if I had any idea in mind of the kinds of judges I would appoint, I clearly remember saying, I do. That would be Judges Scalia and Thomas. Judge Scalia recently gave an interview on the TV show 60 Minutes. I do not know if you are supposed to call it a TV show, kind of newsworthy show. He talked about the schoolchildren who visit the Supreme Court and proudly recite what they had been taught about the living Constitution. Judge Scalia noted that he usually had the sad duty of telling the children that the Constitution was never alive. He believed, as I do and many in this hall believe, that the Constitution is not a living document, it is an enduring document, and good judges know the difference. And I made a promise to the American people during the campaign that if I was fortunate enough to be elected, my administration would seek out judicial nominees who follow that philosophy. We would search from a diverse array of candidates and nominate those who met the highest standards of competence. We would not impose any litmus tests concerning particular issues or cases. Instead, we would seek judges who would faithfully interpret the Constitution and not use the courts to invent laws or dictate social policy. And with your support, we have kept that pledge. I have appointed more than one-third of all the judges now sitting on the Federal bench, and these men and women are jurists of the highest caliber, with an abiding belief in the sanctity of our Constitution. The judicial philosophy that I brought to Washington, DC, is demonstrated most clearly by the-some of the judges I have named to the bench-matter of fact, all the judges I have named to the bench. One of them is the son of an Italian American-schoolteachers from Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated from Princeton and Yale Law. He worked in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department, was the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, and served as a distinguished circuit court judge. When I announced his nomination, this good man was hailed by Democrats and Republicans alike for his keen mind and impeccable credentials. And America is well served by the 110th Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Samuel A. Alito. And serving with Justice Alito on the High Court is the former captain of a high school football team who worked summers in the steel mill to help pay for college. He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard in just 3 years and was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. He later clerked for William H. Rehnquist, the man he would replace as Chief Justice. At his confirmation hearing, this outstanding jurist put his philosophy this way: Judges are like umpires. Umpires do not make the rules, they apply them. It is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire. I was very proud to nominate for the Supreme Court a really decent man and a man of good judgment, and that would be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts. Chief Justice Roberts was so obviously well qualified that he received overwhelming support from Members of the Senate, including many Senators generally considered to be well left of center. Unfortunately, the broad, bipartisan, and timely support for Chief Justice Roberts has increasingly become the exception. Over the years, the advice and consent clause of our Constitution has been subjected to serious abuse. Members of the Senate seem to embrace the advice part; it is the consent part that seems to be the problem. Perhaps the best demonstration of this problem is the story of Miguel Estrada. Miguel was one of my first nominees to the courts, and he had an inspiring personal history. He was an immigrant from Latin America who came to the United States with little knowledge of English. He came to live the dream. He studied hard, and he worked hard, and he made his way to Columbia Law School and then Harvard Law School. He was a Supreme Court clerk. He prosecuted crimes in the U.S. attorney's office in New York, and he served in the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton. When Miguel Estrada was nominated for a seat on the DC Circuit Court, he received a unanimous well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. Yet for more than 2 years, he awaited a simple up-or-down vote in the United States Senate; he never got one. For the first time in history, the Senate used a filibuster to block a nominee to the Court of Appeals. This fine American endured years of delay; he had his character unfairly attacked and ultimately withdrew his name from consideration, all because a minority of Senators thought they would not like his rulings on the bench and worried that a ENTITY might one day elevate him to the Supreme Court. Miguel Estrada deserved better. He deserved a more dignified treatment from the United States Senate. And the American people deserve better behavior from those they send to represent them in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, Miguel Estrada's experience is not an isolated one. Many other well-qualified nominees have endured uncertainty and withering attacks on their character simply because they have accepted the call to public service. Those waiting in limbo include Peter Keisler for the DC Circuit Court, Rod Rosenstein for the Fourth Circuit, and dozens of other nominees to district and circuit courts across this country. Some of these nominees waiting for a simple up-or-down vote would fill court vacancies that have been designated judicial emergencies. While these vacancies remain unfulfilled-unfilled, legal disputes are left unresolved, the backlog of cases grows larger, and the rule of law is delayed for millions of Americans. The broken confirmation process has other consequences that Americans never see. Lawyers approached about being nominated will often politely decline because of the uncertainty and delay and ruthlessness that now characterizes the confirmation process. Some worry about the impact a nomination might have on their children, who would hear their dad or mom's name dragged through the political mud. This situation is unacceptable, and it is bad for our country. A judicial nomination should be a moment of pride for nominees and their families, not the beginning of an ugly battle. And the confirmation process should befit the greatest democracy in the world and not look like a bad episode of Survivor. It is clear we need to improve the process for confirming qualified judicial nominees. This process will always be somewhat contentious. But there are a few things that the American people expect us to agree on. First, the American people expect nominees and their families to be treated with dignity. Nominees should not have to wait years for the up-or-down vote that the Senate owes them. The American people expect their elected officials to do the job of screening judicial nominees. We should not cede to any one legal association the exclusive power to veto a nominee before he or she can make their case to Members of the Senate. The American people expect the nomination process to be as free of partisanship as possible and for Senators to rise above tricks and gimmicks designed to thwart nominees. For example, Senators have invented a new rule that bans the election-year confirmation of anyone not considered a consensus nominee, with consensus defined as only the nominees they happen to choose. In the end, the people hurt most by these partisan maneuvers are the American people. And that is not what our Founders intended, and Presidents and Senators from both parties ought to say so. In Washington, it can be easy to get caught up in the politics of the moment. Yet if we do not act to improve the confirmation process, those who are today deploying harmful tactics and maneuvers to thwart nominees will sooner or later find the tables turned. There are things more important, even in Washington, than politics as usual. Next month, the Senate will hold a lame duck session to finish their legislative business for the year. One item that should be at the top of their agenda is a long list of qualified judicial nominees still waiting for Senate action. If Democrats truly seek a more productive and cooperative relationship in Washington, then they have a perfect opportunity to prove it, by giving these nominees the up-or-down vote they deserve. Our democracy requires us to come together and to get things done for the citizens of this great republic. I am confident we can do that. And I am grateful that there are dedicated people like you all who are working so hard to help us put good judges on the courts and, equally important, to help invest the American people in the process. I salute you for your good work. Appreciate the chance to come and visit with you. May God bless you, and may God bless the American people.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecincinnatichapterthefederalistsocietycincinnatiohio", "title": "Remarks to the Cincinnati Chapter of the Federalist Society in Cincinnati, Ohio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-cincinnati-chapter-the-federalist-society-cincinnati-ohio", "publication_date": "06-10-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 906, "text": "Thanks for coming. One of the reasons I like this job so much is, you get to be introduced by your wife. And I appreciate Laura's love and compassion for all children, and I appreciate the job she is doing. I am a lucky man to be able to call her my wife. And thanks for coming. The kidnaping of a child is every parent's worst nightmare. Yet, too many moms and dads have experienced this nightmare across America. Too many have suffered. I have just met with parents-Laura and I met with parents-who have had the most precious person in their lives suddenly and brutally taken away from them. Some of these parents were eventually reunited with their children. Some are still hoping and waiting. Some know they will never see their loved ones again in this earthly life. When a child's life or liberty or innocence is taken, it is a terrible, terrible loss.And those responsible have committed a terrible crime. Our society has a duty, has a solemn duty, to shield children from exploitation and danger. At this conference, we are discussing the steps that parents and community leaders and law enforcement can take to prevent such tragedies. I want to thank the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for helping organize this important and vital meeting. And I want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate the senior members of my administration who are leading the sessions at today's conference. I thank our Secretary of State Colin Powell, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Secretary Tommy Thompson, Secretary Rod Paige. I appreciate the Director of the FBI, Bob Mueller, for coming. And I want to thank the Commissioner, Robert Bonner, of the U.S. Customs. I know there is a lot of Members of Congress who are here. I see the great Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, is here, as well as other Members of Congress. Thank you all for coming. Thank you for taking this issue seriously, and thanks for joining with a lot of concerned citizens. I appreciate so very much the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They do a really good job for America. I want to thank Ernie Allen-I want to thank Ernie, and I want to thank Carolyn Atwell-Davis, the legal consultant, for their hard work and for their care and concern. I also want to thank Margaret Spellings, who is Assistant to ENTITY for Domestic Policy, for moderating this conference. And of course, I have got to say something about John Walsh, TV star. But he is a guy who cares deeply about our country, about the safety of our citizens. And John, thank you for the service you do on behalf of the American people. Our first duty as adults is to create an environment in which children can grow and thrive without fearing for their security. That is what we have got to do. Because children are so vulnerable, they need the care of adults. Because they are so vulnerable, those who are cruel and predatory often target our children. We see the dangers to our children in the cases of abduction, many of which are known to us all. Each year, tens of thousands of children are abducted by non-family members, often in connection with a crime. And while the overwhelming majority of these children are returned from abductions, too many are not. One is too many, particularly for the mom or dad who suffers deeply. We see the dangers in the experience of runaway children who are often victims of hunger and sickness and sexual abuse. Every year, assaults and illness and suicide take the lives of about 5,000 runaways. One life is too many. The threats to our children are found not just on the streets, but they are found on the technology which we use in our homes. The Internet is a wonderful tool for our children to broaden their knowledge, expand their minds, but the evils of the world have crept into the Internet. In 1 year alone, one in five children between the ages of 10 and 17 received a sexual solicitation over the Internet. With expanding use of the Internet and the heightened activity of predators searching for underage victims, more children are being lured into harmful and even tragic situations. In every region in the world, children can be vulnerable, not just here at home but children everywhere. Each year, about a million girls and boys are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Such trafficking is nothing less than a modern form of slavery, an unspeakable and unforgivable crime against the most vulnerable members of the global society. All these dangers put children at risk. All these dangers demand action to protect our children from harm. The Justice Department has made the prevention and investigation of child abductions a major priority. We are providing State and local authorities with access to fingerprint records and forensic experts and training on missing-children cases. We want the local authorities to have the best available technologies and skills in order to respond quickly. The Department sponsors a 24-hour hotline for reporting missing children, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We are waging a nationwide effort to prevent use of the Internet to sexually exploit children. We are seeking to almost double the funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces, which will help State and local authorities enforce laws against child pornography and exploitation. We are vigorously prosecuting those who prey on our children. We need to send a clear message: If you prey on our children, there will be serious, severe consequences. Earlier this year, in Operation Candyman, the FBI dismantled a major child pornography ring: they made more than 100 arrests. I am pleased that the House of Representatives passed the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act this year to revise and strengthen our pornography laws. The Senate needs to work with the House to get legislation done before they go home. We need to do everything we can to protect our children from the evils of pornography. We will not forget the suffering and struggles of America's runaway children. The Federal Government supports hundreds of emergency shelters and programs that reach out to young people living on the street, offering them food and comfort and counseling. These programs are mainly administered by community and faith-based groups. After all, it is in our faith-based community where we hear that universal call to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. It is in our faith-based groups that we find deep compassion to help those in need and who are troubled. And many of the runaway kids are troubled and in deep need of love. There are as many as 100,000 runaway children every year. And these children are vulnerable; they are vulnerable to exploitation. There are some great programs in America, people who are soldiers in the armies of compassion, one of which is the Covenant House. We are honored today to have Sister Mary Rose McGeady here. She runs the Covenant House. And if you do not know anything about the Covenant House and if you are interested in helping, support the Covenant House or programs like the Covenant House, because these people help those on the street, those young, vulnerable children on the street, to realize there is love in our society and there is hope for a better way. On the international front, the United States is acting vigorously against the trafficking of young people. Last February, I established an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. The task force is working hard to prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent future trafficking. The past year alone, the Department of Justice prosecuted four times as many traffickers as it did 2 years ago. We are making progress. We have got to continue to work with our friends and allies to prevent this scourge from not only spreading but to stop it. It is, as I said earlier, slavery. And this Nation stands against slavery of any kind. The responsibility to protect America's children is shared throughout our society by government at every level and by parents in every home. Parents, of course, are the first line of defense against danger. To help our parents protect their children, the Department of Education has distributed a new guidebook providing practical steps that parents can take to make their children safer, practical steps that make it clear about how a parent needs to deal with their child about the dangers facing children. And this information, you will be pleased to hear, is written in ways so that the children can actually understand what is on the page. The book tells mothers and fathers how to rehearse with their children what to say or do if they ever feel threatened. It is a practical guide to explain to children how to deal with predators that are smooth and seductive, how to deal with somebody that is a stranger that sounds sweet-talking but may in their heart be dark and dangerous for our children. The book also lists web sites that provide information about protecting children. Information is powerful, and it is important for our parents to know. Parents need to pay as much attention to their children, by the way, when they are on the Internet as when they are on a playground. They have got to know what their children are doing on the Internet. They have got to know with whom they are conversing. This guidebook will help. We are passing it out to the Nation's schools, and the schools will then make it available to parents. And as well, parents can request a copy of the guidebook, a practical go-by as to how to train your children how to deal with potential danger. And you can find it on missingkids.com. If you are interested, if you want a practical go-by, call up missingkids.com on the Internet, and you will get some practical steps as to how to help your children avoid danger. Sometimes, in spite of a family's best effort, the unthinkable does happen, and that is really sad. It breaks my heart to know that that continues to happen in America. At that point, the parents need the sup-port-when their child is abducted, the parents need immediate support of their communities, quick action to find their children. Time is of the essence. One of the most successful programs to locate abducted children is what is called the AMBER Plan. It is a voluntary partnership through which police and local broadcasters issue urgent bulletins to the public as soon as a child is missing. The program began in a local effort in Texas, I am proud to report, in the Dallas area in 1996 after Amber Hagerman was abducted. My friend State Senator Florence Shapiro is with us-I believe, one of the panelists. She helped launch the AMBER program. I know that it makes her feel really good to know that AMBER, when in place, can really help people, just like it helped Sharon Brooks and her 16-yearold daughter, Tamara. This summer, Tamara and Jacqueline were abducted at gunpoint in Lancaster, California. Tamara told us her story. The police issued an AMBER Alert within hours and soon received tips that led to their rescue. People all across America shared a great feeling of relief when she and her buddy were rescued. One of the reasons they were is because of the AMBER Plan. There are gaps in AMBER, however. There are gaps in the AMBER Plan coverage which must be filled, and we can fill them. We will develop more AMBER Plans and better coordination among plans. We should not allow another day to go by without taking steps to expand the AMBER Plan's reach all across our country. And so the Attorney General today is appointing an AMBER Alert Coordinator to help State and local officials develop, enhance, and coordinate AMBER Plans all across America. The Department of Justice will establish standards for the issuance and dissemination of alerts. The Justice and Transportation Departments will take immediate action to provide a total of $10 million to improve the growing network of AMBER Plans. We want AMBER Plan Alerts to be issued as quickly and as effectively as possible, including electronic billboards along the Nation's highways. I support legislation passed by Senator Hutchison of Texas and Senator Feinstein of California to achieve the goals I just outlined and codify them in law. And I want to thank you both for your hard work. The House has not acted yet, so I am going to. And that is why I have just laid out the initiative. If possible, it would be very helpful if the House passed the Hutchison-Feinstein law before they go home. I also am pleased that good corporate citizens are involved with helping our children. And I particularly want to point out Toys R Us or Wal-Mart, Home Depot, as well as Ford Motor dealerships, which are providing free child photo IDs, so that parents can provide law enforcement with sharply focused head-and-shoulder pictures along with relevant biological information in the event of emergency. By the end of this year, more than 2 1/2 million children will have been photographed and identified to help recover them if they are ever abducted. I hope a lot of other companies follow these good citizens' example. I hope you make available resources necessary to help us combat-to fight against abduction and to help save those lives-save the lives of those who have fallen prey to one of the worst crimes in our society. This White House Conference on Missing and Exploited and Runaway Children is important for America; it just is. And I want to thank you all for coming. This is the beginning of a refocused effort at the Federal level to help save people's lives. This is an attempt-more than an at-tempt-this is the beginning of a successful strategy implemented at all levels of government and all parts of our society to recognize a real threat and to deal with it, to recognize there are some so evil in our society that they are willing to harm our most precious and most vulnerable citizens, and to be prepared to respond quickly when that happens, to help people prevent it from happening in the first place, to make it clear, if you do it and we catch you, there is going to be serious consequences for you. We can deal with this problem, because this is America. This is a country full of people who love and care. It is a compassionate and decent nation. This is the beginning of a concerted effort to do our duty as responsible citizens of the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Again, I want to thank you all for taking your citizenship seriously. I want to thank you for understanding that a patriot is somebody more than who just puts their hand on their heart; a patriot is somebody who is willing to do whatever you can to make this country the best-continue to be the best on the face of our Earth. May God bless your efforts. May God bless our children. And may God bless America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehouseconferencemissingexploitedandrunawaychildren", "title": "Remarks at the White House Conference on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-white-house-conference-missing-exploited-and-runaway-children", "publication_date": "02-10-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 627, "text": "Good morning. I am speaking to you this morning from the Gibbs Magnet School for International Studies in Little Rock, Arkansas. I am happy to be joined by the principal, Dr. Marjorie Bassa, members of her staff, and 30 wonderful elementary students, their parents, and other interested citizens here. This school and these people are living proof that the education reforms that were started when I was Governor of Arkansas and that are continuing now under the leadership of Governor Tucker are paying off. The young people who attend this public school are getting a head start on the 21st century. Beginning in kindergarten, they learn about other cultures. They receive foreign language training. They are already acquiring the skills that will allow them one day to compete and win in the new global economy. They come from many different racial and cultural backgrounds, but they all have a shot at the American dream. I want to spend a few moments telling you why I think education and training for all of our people is the most important thing we can do to keep the American dream alive in the 21st century. You know Washington's in the midst of a great debate today about the proper role of our National Government. On one side is the old view that big, one-size-fits-all Government can provide the answers to all of our big problems. On the other side is the view that Government is the source of all of our problems. In the real world, that is a false choice. Let us look at what started this debate. As we move toward the 21st century and the information age, jobs and incomes will depend more and more on what we know and what we can learn. That means that today, at the end of the cold war, we are able to create jobs, new businesses, new millionaires at a rapid rate, more than ever before. But at the same time, about two-thirds of our people are working hard for the same or lower wages and are quite insecure about their future. And we know we still have too many social problems we are not making enough headway on, crime and drugs, violence and family breakdown. In the real world, we have to face the fact that we have to create opportunity but deal with these problems of economic stagnation and social disintegration. And we are stuck with a Government that is too organized to meet the problems of yesterday and not enough able to meet the problems of today and tomorrow. I believe we have to chart a new course between the old way of big Government and the new rage of no Government, because I believe we need a Government that does four things: first, that creates economic opportunity-grow the middle class and shrink the under class; second, that enhances the security of the American people here at home, on our streets, in our schools, and abroad; and third, that reforms the National Government to make it smaller, less bureaucratic, to serve the interests of ordinary Americans, not special interests, to serve the future, not the past, and to demand more personal responsibility of our citizens. Fourth, and most important, we need a Government that helps our people raise their education and skill levels so they can make the most of their own lives. That is what I call the New Covenant, a partnership between Americans and their Government that offers more opportunity in return for more responsibility. Earlier this week, I convened a regional economic conference at Emory University in Atlanta with a group of economists, business and Government leaders. And working Americans discussed ways to strengthen our economy and to ensure a better future for our children. They were Republicans, Democrats, and independents. But the one thing we all agreed on was that the countries that will do the best job of developing the full capacities of all of their children and all of their adults will be the most successful in the 21st century. We all agree that higher education levels are essential if we are going to raise the incomes of working Americans, if we are going to grow the middle class and shrink the under class. That is why I and my administration have worked so hard to expand Head Start, to set world-class standards for our schools, to give parents and teachers more resources to meet those standards but also to give them more authority at the school level to decide how best to achieve excellence. We have worked to establish apprenticeship programs to prepare young people who do not go on to college to get higher paying jobs. And we have worked hard to make college loans more affordable for more students, millions of them throughout the country. By eliminating the middlemen in the college loan system, lowering the cost, and offering better repayment terms, our direct student loan program is giving more young people a chance to go to college while saving tax dollars at the same time. And we are demanding more responsibility in return. More students get loans at lower cost, but now they have to pay them back. Stricter enforcement of the student loan program has cut the cost of delinquent loans to taxpayers from $2.8 billion in 1991 to a billion dollars today. That is opportunity and responsibility. Because we have focused on education, for the last 2 years we have been able to cut Government spending, cut the deficit, cut hundreds of programs and over 100,000 bureaucrats from the Federal budget, and still increase our investment in education. Now, many in Congress think there is no difference in education and other spending. For example, there are proposals to reduce funding for Head Start; for public school efforts to meet the national education goals; for our national service program, Ameri- Corps, which provides scholarship money for young people who will work at minimum wage jobs in local community service projects; even proposals to reduce school lunch funding. There are proposals to eliminate our efforts for safe and drug-free schools altogether and, unbelievably, to cut the college loan programs. These are not wise proposals. Here at Gibbs, where students are preparing for the 21st century, close to 50 percent of the students depend upon the School Lunch Program for a nutritious meal. And all these young people, not just those who have the money to afford it, should be able to go as far as their talents will carry them. And if that means they need scholarships, student loans, and the opportunity to do community service, we ought to give it to them. Some in Congress want to cut education to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. I want instead a middle class tax cut that helps families pay for education and training, a tax deduction for education costs after high school. Now in the past, education and training have enjoyed broad, bipartisan support. Last year, with strong support from Republicans and Democrats, Congress enacted my proposals to help students and schools meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. Educational experts said we did more for education by expanding Head Start, expanding apprenticeships, expanding college loans than any session of Congress in 30 years. Now in this new Congress, some want to cut education, and that is wrong. Gibbs Magnet School is a reflection of what we ought to be doing more of in America. I do not know what political party these children belong to, but I do know we need them all and they deserve our best efforts to give them a shot at the American dream. We must begin when they are young, training our people to succeed, preparing them for a lifetime of learning. The fight for education is the fight for the American dream. Thanks again to all those people who are here with me today, especially our children. And thanks for listening.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress324", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-324", "publication_date": "01-04-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 681, "text": "Darn right. Bill, welcome, and Jane, thanks for coming. It is my honor to welcome your family here to the Roosevelt Room. And I am proud to welcome Bill Donaldson as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bill will be a strong leader of the SEC and a forceful advocate for the interests of investors. He is the right man at the right time. We are so honored you have agreed to accept this challenge, really appreciate it. Bill Donaldson spent a career preparing for this challenge. He has served as a founder of a leading investment banking firm, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, the founding dean of the Yale School of Management. He has set high standards throughout his entire career. He will lead an active and energetic agency. This agency has been working hard. They have last year filed a record number of actions for financial reporting and disclosure violations, sought the removal of more than 100 corporate officers and directors on the grounds of misconduct, and ordered corporations and executives to return to investors hundreds of million dollars in improper gains. This administration is committed to the enforcement of the security laws. We are committed to creating a climate of confidence in our markets. There is no better person to help achieve that commitment than Bill Donaldson. In the 2004 budget, I am asking Congress to increase SEC funding by 73 percent over the year 2002. We want to make sure the SEC has the tools necessary to pursue its important mission. This Nation is increasingly a nation of stockholders, who invest for their families and for their futures. Americans should be confident in the information they use in order to make investment decisions. All investors deserve to be treated fairly in the Tax Code as well. Investors should not be punished for saving and investing in America's future. Investors should not be- should be rewarded for taking risk in the marketplace. The Tax Code ought to treat these people fairly, and so that is why I have proposed that Congress end the unfair and unwise double taxation of dividends. This measure could improve corporate governance in America as well. Companies across America attract investors in a number of ways. One such way is to promise rapid growth, is to say, Even though we may not have cashflow, the future of our company is magnificent. Therefore, invest with us. Another way, of course, is to promise a steady source of income in the form of dividends. Eliminating double taxation of dividends would give more companies a reason to distribute their profits through direct cash to investors in the form of dividends. With dividends serving as a stronger foundation for long-term value, companies that pay them will have less motive to artificially inflate profits just to cause temporary increases in stocks. Our law should not discriminate against those companies that focus on stable, long-term growth. Eliminating the double taxation of dividends is good for American investors; it is good for American seniors; it is good for corporate reform. I am glad Bill Donaldson has agreed to take charge of an agency with the vital purpose of showing the American investor that they are -can rely upon the data on which they use to evaluate investments, to really say to the markets loud and clear that we expect there to be corporate integrity throughout our system. This is a man who has not only set high standards but has achieved them. He is got a lot of talent and a lot of drive, a lot of wisdom, and a lot of integrity.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheswearingceremonyforwilliamdonaldsonchairmanthesecuritiesandexchange", "title": "Remarks at the Swearing-In Ceremony for William Donaldson as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-swearing-ceremony-for-william-donaldson-chairman-the-securities-and-exchange", "publication_date": "18-02-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 1078, "text": "Well, first let me thank Reverend Jackson. And Jackie, thank you. And Dick Grasso, thank you for having all of us here tonight. This is the first time I have ever spoken from this microphone. You know, as ENTITY, I am superstitious, and we have had such a good stock market. I do not ever comment on it except I like the way it finished today. I wanted to say just a couple of things very briefly. First of all, I want to thank Dick Grasso for his leadership in the Wall Street Project. A lot of people do not know that the stock market was organized over 200 years ago so that there would be a mechanism through which bonds could be issued to finance America's debts in the war for our independence. So, in the beginning, this stock market had not just a profit motive but a public interest purpose. This man has infused the stock market not only with its greatest success in history but with a public interest purpose, to include all Americans in our prosperity. And we thank him. Most of you were with us today in the afternoon, and I will not make you sit through my speech againor stand through my speech again, even though I'd kind of like to, because this is the first crowd in a long time when I have been guaranteed a standing ovation. I just want to make two points. One, I want to thank Jesse Jackson for being there on this issue for a long time, saying we would never be the country we ought to be until we really had economic opportunity for allthat's what the Wall Street Project is all aboutand that it would be good business, as well as good morality. The second point I want to make, that I made today and I leave with all of you is, this is the only time in my lifetime we have had a booming economy, improvements in all of our social fabric, the absence of crisis at home and domestic threats, and the absence of threats to our security around the world as big as those we faced in the cold war. None of this has ever happened before. The big question before us is, what are we going to do with this magic moment? Are we going to take the long look into the future and do the big things that America needs, or are we going to indulge ourselves in shortsighted frittering away of our present wealth and serenity at home and stability around the world? I am just telling you, we will never be the country we ought to be until every person, including the people and places that have been left behind in this remarkable recovery, has a chance to live the American dream. We will never be as safe a country, as whole a country, the one America we ought to be, until everybody has a chance. That is what the Wall Street Project is all about. That is what my new markets initiative is all about. And I want to implore you to use this millennial year of 2000 to ask all of our fellow Americans to think about those who could be a part of what we celebrate and thank God for every day, but are not yet. If we make them a part of it, we will really give a gift to our children and to the 21st century. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswallstreetprojectconferencereceptionnewyorkcity", "title": "Remarks at a Wall Street Project Conference Reception in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-wall-street-project-conference-reception-new-york-city", "publication_date": "13-01-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 1011, "text": "We have been through an arduous campaign. It has been almost unique as a campaign of education in the great domestic and international problems which have arisen out of events of the last 15 years. I have endeavored to place these problems before the people as I see them from the facts and experience that have come to me in these past years. I wished the people to realize more intimately the difficulties with which their Government has been confronted, the disasters which have been averted, and the forces which have been mobilized for their support and their protection. I hope from these discussions that the people will realize the great crisis that we have successfully passed and the unprecedented measures taken which have been designed solely that we might protect and restore the system of life and of government endeared to us over 150 years--a government that has given to us protection from distress and allayed the forces which would otherwise have wrecked our homes and our firesides. But more than that, I hope I have given an understanding of these measures that have been designed for counterattack upon this crisis. These measures are now demonstrating their strength and effectiveness not only at home but abroad, evidences of which are multiplying throughout the country in the return of more than half a million men to work monthly, and that we have again resumed the road toward prosperity. I might add that the figure which I have given during the last few days of the return of 1 million men to work since the adjournment of the Congress have been added to during the day today by the estimates of the American Federation of Labor which increased the estimates, which I have given to you, by nearly 300,000 men. I wish to emphasize the greatest function of the American citizen, the one which each of us should perform tomorrow. The ballot is that most sacred individual act which preserves the great system of self-government which we have inherited and which should carry forward at any cost. It is a direct opportunity for every man and woman to express their views in terms of equality with every other citizen as to the policies and kind of a government that they wish carried out in the next 4 years. And I have a deep feeling that the choice that you make now is more than the choice for another 4 years. There is great divergence in the philosophy of government between the parties which may affect events over a generation; a mistaken choice may hazard the welfare of our children and our children's children. I have been fighting that the wrong course may not be adopted, not by appeal to destructive emotion, but by truth and logic. I have tried to dissolve the mirage of promises by the reality of facts. I am a believer in party government. It is only through party organization that our people can give coherent expression to their views upon public issues. There is no other way except by revolution, but we in America have ordained that the ballot shall be used for peaceful determination and not violence. We are a nation of progressives. We wish to see our Nation march forward. We differ strongly as to the method to progress. I differ widely with the principles and views advocated by our opponents, but it is not my purpose to review them at this moment. I feel deeply that the Republican Party has been the party of progress in our history from the days of Abraham Lincoln. It has built the progress of the Nation upon the foundations of national principles and national ideals. We are a nation of homes from which the accomplishment of individuals is nurtured by the maximum freedom in an ordered liberty. The ultimate goal of our progress is to build for security and happiness in these homes where the inspiration of our religious faiths will implant in our children those principles of social order and idealism, and where our Government will contribute in safeguarding their future opportunity for them. The action of our Nation has been modified and benefited by the enfranchisement of women. They equally with the men bear the shocks from economic disaster. With them lies largely the guardianship of the fundamental ideals, because concentrated in their lives and their responsibilities is a solicitude for the preservation of the home and the inspiration for the future. And in these labors our Government can contribute to strengthen their accomplishment and their influence. Our women give with lavish hands, not only to childhood, but, as well, to the creation of those conserving customs upon which are builded all the blessings of our ordered Government. They thus give to government a large measure of the true strength of its foundations. It is but just that they receive back, in return, all that the Government can give them to assure them of security and the enlargement of the equal opportunity to their children and to themselves, to widen the field for the use of their own powers of mind and spirit. It is they who are mobilizing new public regard to our obligations to home and children of the future; it is they who are mobilizing the public opinion on the maintenance of peace in the world. The men of our country carry the frontline of battle through their initiative, their enterprise, their hopes, their courage. The immediate question before our country is in whose direction shall be the measures by which we shall emerge from our present difficulties. In the longer view our problems are the questions that the world should have peace; that the prosperity of the Nation shall be diffused to all, and that we shall build more strongly the ideal of equal opportunity amongst all our people; that we shall secure that obedience to law which is essential to assurance of life in our institutions; that honesty and righteousness in business shall confirm the confidence of our people in our institutions and laws; that our Government shall contribute to leadership in these matters. It is my deep conviction that for the welfare of the United States the Republican Party should continue to administer the Government. Those men and women who have supported the party over these many years should not be led astray by false gods arrayed in the rainbow colors of promises. They have but to review the performance and the sense of responsibility, the constructive action, the maintenance of national ideals by the Republican Party, in every national crisis including the present, always in opposition to the destructive forces of sectional and group action of our opponents. Election Day is more than a day set aside for casting of our several ballots. There is a solemnity in the feeling of that day, the sense of being in the presence of a great invisible power when the united people of a great nation give their final judgment on great issues. We cannot feel that any human power alone can give us such emotions; rather we must trust that we are sensing the movements of that Ruler of the universe in whose beneficence and in whose favor we have been blessed throughout our history. As a final word, I wish to convey my deep gratitude to the many hundreds of thousands of people who have come to stations and to meetings to welcome and encourage me during this past month and to the many millions more who have responded to me over the radio. I wish to express my gratitude to the young men and the young women who have organized their special movement to my support, for in them lies a special energy and idealism which drives and inspires the country; to the veterans' service leagues whose tested patriotism has supported me in this campaign; to the devoted women who, realizing the results at stake, have worked untiringly for the return of this administration; and to the organizations of men throughout the country who have been unceasing through this campaign in their presentation to the American people of the principles and ideals for which I have stood.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationfromelkonevada", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation From Elko, Nevada.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-from-elko-nevada", "publication_date": "07-11-1932", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Herbert Hoover"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 596, "text": "Thank you very much for coming. Second only to Georgia in the primary, does anybody here know which State gave me the biggest margin of victory when I ran for President? Right on. And I have come to thank you for that. Not too long ago, the Congress and I restored full citizenship to President Jefferson Davis. And since Camp David, the Congress and the people of the country have done the same to me, and I want to thank you for that, too. For any Democrat coming to Tennessee, and particularly coming to Nashville, is a homecoming, because Andrew Jackson, one of the greatest Presidents who ever lived, the father of our party, has made Tennessee a homecoming place for all Democrats. He was a man of great courage. He was a man who was independent. He was a man who loved his home State. He was a man who founded the principles of our party, that said that those who hold public office have to put our faith, our confidence, our responsibility to the average, common, good American citizens who put us in office. That was Andrew Jackson's commitment. That is the commitment of the Democratic Party today, and we are going to keep it that way. There has been a time in the last few years when Tennessee strayed temporarily from the Democratic Party and from the principles of Andrew Jackson. But that time is gone. And in the last few years, we have seen a major shift back toward Democrats by Tennessee, and that is going to keep on the next 2 weeks. Georgia, my own State, has always been close to Tennessee. We share a lot with you. When it snows in the north Georgia mountains and the northwestern part of our State, our State legislators have to come through Tennessee to get home to Atlanta to act as legislators. We have always kept those borders open, except one time when General Sherman crossed them on the way from Tennessee through Atlanta. But with that one exception, we bind ourselves to you. We will keep those lines open. And I am proud to say that as Tennesseans, I consider you my brother, and I am glad to be here as that, too. In addition to Andrew Jackson, Tennessee has provided some great Democratic statesmen: James K. Polk, President of the United States; Cordell Hull, one of the greatest Secretaries of State our country has ever seen; Estes Kefauver, who ought to have been President of the United States. Kefauver was a man who went throughout the country, standing on street corners, standing in factory shift lines early in the morning, shaking hands with the American citizens and saying, What can I do for you if I am the nominee of the Democratic Party? I believe he entered 13 primaries. He won 11 of them. He was not elected President, but he set a standard of campaigning that I followed very closely when in 1976 I entered 30 primaries and won a fairly good number of those which gave me an avenue to the White House. I want to recognize, too, a great United States Senator who served at the same time, Senator Albert Gore, who is been an inspiration to a lot of southerners. As you well know, when the South was going through those difficult days of changing from a segregated society to one where we gave all American citizens equal rights, regardless of color, Albert Gore, Estes Kefauver set a standard for the rest of us to follow. Their courage has made the southland a better place to live for blacks and whites. And I want to thank them for what they meant to me and to my own people. I will always remember the Democratic convention when Frank Clement made an inspiring address, and his son, Bob,2 has brought the same kind of approach to Democratic politics in this State. And he supported the Democratic nominees as a loyal Democrat should, in this same status with the same tradition as his father, Frank. I cannot come to Tennessee, especially Nashville, without mentioning Dick Fulton, a man who was in the Congress, who could have stayed there as long as he wanted to, who was doing a great job, but felt that he could do a better job and be closer to you if he came home as mayor of Nashville. And I hate to miss him in Washington, but I am glad you have got him. And I am very thankful that he is doing such a great job here as your mayor, and I want to make sure that everybody knows about that. Some people said he came to Nashville to be closer to country music. But that is not true any more, because you cannot get any closer to country music that originates in Nashville than you do in the White House when I turn my record player on or my radio on-that is the kind of music I really love. And we have had a lot of great music performers from your city come to entertain us and many others in the White House since I have been President. The night before last, my wife and I were on the telephone talking to June Carter and also to her husband, as you know, about the unfortunate loss of Maybelle Carter. She set not only a standard in country music that is inspired Johnny Cash and many others as well as her own family, but she also set a standard of common, ordinary people who love one another, expressing their views, their hopes, their dreams, their fears to the world through music. And I want to thank you for her. As June knows, I always claim kinship with her, particularly after I started running for office. And that family means a lot to me and to the rest of the country. I just want to mention two other people. Al Bissell, a great mayor of Oakridge, has provided us with a standard of leadership at the municipal level, and I predict that his son, Keith, will do an equally good job as public service commissioner next year. Jay Solomon, a Tennessean, came to Washington at my request. He did not much want to come, but he is a great businessman from Chattanooga, and he took over as Administrator of the General Services Administration, the GSA. And he is done as much to let us know about waste and corruption in Government as anyone. He is fighting the battles for you to make the Federal Government be better, cleaner, more decent, more honest. He is the kind of fellow who issues the contracts now after he opens the bids. And I want to thank Tennessee for giving me Jay Solomon. I have really come here today to get you to work hard for the nominees for Governor, United States Senate, State offices, and the U.S. Congress, whom you have already chosen in an open, tough, difficult, closely contested Democratic primary. You have chosen a man to come to Washington with me 2 years ago, who is done an outstanding job already. And I want to express my deep thanks to you for sending Jim Sasser to Washington, who has already carved out for himself a position of leadership. One of the most important responsibilities of any Senator is to pass the appropriations bills, deciding where money goes for every possible service the National Government provides. Jim Sasser just happens to be on the Appropriations Committee. Another important job, of course, is preparing the budget to cut down on deficits and to make sure the Congress toes the line when they spend your money. It just happens that Jim Sasser is on the Senate Budget Committee. Another important job is to give government reorganization a chance to let us have a better government. We have passed now a very fine civil service reform law to put our good civil servants to work a little harder for you. It just happens that Jim Sasser is chairman of the Civil Service Reform Committee, and I want to thank Tennessee for giving me this strong ally and friend and supporter in Washington. I have only got one complaint to make about Jim Sasser. He is a little too independent. When it comes down to deciding what I want him to do, compared to what Tennessee wants him to do, he always does what you want him to do. Now I want to comment on one man who is had maybe a more difficult youth than I had. When I was 14 years old, because of the TVA and because of the REA, we got electricity and running water in the house I lived in. Jake Butcher did not get it until he was 16 years old. He is a man who comes from humble beginnings. He is a man who exemplifies in my mind the true spirit of Tennessee. He is worked hard. He has cast his lot with the people of this State. He is a competent, successful businessman. When I was Governor of Georgia, I spent about 25 percent of my time trying to bring industry into my State. I spent that time trying to revive the possibility of jobs for Georgians, to make sure we were a dynamic, growing State, to make sure the State government was run economically and efficiently as a business ought to be. And you have a true treasure coming up next year in Jake Butcher as your Governor. And I hope every one of you will help him. I have particularly admired his. positive campaign. He has not run a negative campaign. He is pointed out to you how Tennessee could be a better State with good leadership. And he has got a particularly soft spot in his heart for senior citizens. If he is elected Governor-and I am sure he will be-he is promised all those over 65 years old that you will not have to pay sales tax on food. That shows where he stands. That shows one of the things that he will do. And now I want to mention a woman who, next January, is going to make Jim Sasser senior Senator from Tennessee-Jane Eskind. In the Tennessee primary-and there is no other like it in the whole United States-you had nine candidates for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator. Nobody thought Jane Eskind had a chance. Jane Eskind thought she had a chance. She put her political future in your hands. And she came through on top. The reason is that she is tough, competent, she knows government. She will come with a clear eye and a clean-sweeping broom. She is cast her lot with the little people, the common, ordinary, good working people of Tennessee. And she will bring to Washington the true spirit of Andrew Jackson. And I hope all of you will help her when November 7 comes. I will have to express my thanks as a peanut farmer to Ed Jones, the dean of the Tennessee congressional delegation and one of the leading members of the Congress in passing agricultural legislation for our country. Albert Gore, Jr., fits in well with Tennessee. He is on the committee responsible for science and technology. And Tennessee, with a dynamic economy and a clear vision of the future, is certainly benefiting from his incumbency, and I am sure he will go back into office. And you have got here in Nashville a man to fill some big shoes, your next Congressman, Bill Boner. Ron Arline will be the next Congressman; Gordon Ball, Margaret Francis. We have got the most wonderful Democratic slate you have ever had, and I hope you will help me get all of them elected in 2 weeks, November 7, Tuesday after next. Will you do that for us? Very good. Now I'd like to say just a word about our Nation. Tennessee is the Volunteer State. You got that title and that reputation because you have always been willing and eager to defend our Nation when it was in trouble. And as your Governor pointed out, since I have been in office, we have not called on a single Tennessean nor a single American to lose a life or to shed blood in conflict in another country. And I want to keep that record as long as I am in the White House. Our Nation has taken the leadership in trying to preserve peace for our own people, in trying to bring peace to others. We are negotiating now to conclude a SALT treaty, to make sure that we lessen the threat of nuclear weapons for people in our own country and throughout the world. We are trying to negotiate, with some success already, peace in the Middle East, between Israel and Egypt. This is a difficult undertaking, and we need your help, your prayers, and your support. We are trying to strengthen our ties with our own allies, to let NATO be stronger. We have got a strong defense, ever improving. We are the strongest nation on Earth militarily, and as long as I am in the White House, we are going to stay number one in defense. Tennesseans believe in hard work. So do I. When I was elected President, we had 10 million Americans, 10 million Americans who could not get a full-time job. We had 7 million Americans or more who could not get a job at all. But we put America back to work. We have had, since I have been in office, an increase of 6 million net new jobs for America, and we are going to keep on giving our people a chance to work for themselves and for our country. We are trying to provide better education, better housing, better highways, a good agricultural program. With your Congressmen's help, we passed a farm bill about a year ago that is already improved farm income 25 percent. We have got the highest level of agricultural exports in the history of our country last year. This year, it is going to be even higher; next year, higher still. We are trying also to make sure that we have a good energy program, and for the first time in the history of our Nation, we now have a good, sound energy policy that is going to be better in the future with your help. 3 yesterday, I signed a bill to deregulate the airline industry. We are trying to get Government's nose out of the business of the people of this country, and we have made good progress already. We have had a decrease in airline fares, a tremendous increase in the number of people who can now afford to fly in airplanes, and the profits of the airline industry have gone up. And by 1985, we will have eliminated a major Federal regulatory agency, the CAB, the Civil Aeronautics Board, because we have proven that the American free enterprise system can work if competition is put in and the consumers are protected. That is the kind of government we are trying to give you. The Democratic Party has always been a party with a heart. We believe in people and giving our people a better chance to live. But we are also a party that knows how to manage government. When I was running for President in 1976 and you helped me so much, we had a Federal budget deficit of $66 billion. In 1 year, we cut it down to the fifties. We have now cut it down to the forties. By the end of next year, we will have cut it in half, and we are going to keep on working until we have a balanced budget for the Federal Government and responsible to you. At the same time, we have cut taxes. Better services, lower taxes, lower budget deficits, better management, zero-base budgeting-these are the kind of things that we believe are important. We are cutting out corruption. I signed an ethics bill this morning to make public officials accountable for where their income is derived and how they spend the money and whether they are honest. This will go a long step forward. And the next big undertaking is to control inflation in our Nation. For the last 10 years, the inflation rate in our country has averaged 6 1/2 percent. As I said the other night, the 3 years before I became President, it averaged 8 percent. And I want to ask your promise as the last thing today, will you help me with our anti-inflation program to control inflation in this country? Will you help me? Right on. Well, I want to close by saying this: You have shown your confidence in me as a Georgian, as a neighbor, as a southerner, as an American. The Presidency of the United States is not an easy job. But I feel at ease with it, in spite of the difficulties, in spite of the challenges, in spite of the promises that need to be kept, in spite of the problems that face me every day, because I cast my lot with you when I ran for President. I also stood on street corners, in factory shift lines, went through city halls and courthouses, met you on the street, shook hands, asked for your advice and your support. That is where my strength comes from, from you. That is where the strength of Andrew Jackson came from, from you. And I hope to maintain your confidence in me and improve your confidence in the Federal Government by good management, by peace, by openness, by strength, and because you control me and your Government. This is what the Democratic Party stands for also. And I hope on November 7 that all of you will do the best you can to elect the fine slate of Democratic officers and make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future. Thank you very much. Are we going to win in November? Right on. Are you going to work and help us win? Right on. Thank you very much. I love every one of you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsnashvilletennesseeremarksstatedemocraticpartyrally", "title": "Nashville, Tennessee Remarks at a State Democratic Party Rally.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/nashville-tennessee-remarks-state-democratic-party-rally", "publication_date": "26-10-1978", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1065, "text": "Thank you so much. Thank you, Chief Emerson, Sheriff Kolender, District Attorney Phingst. Chief Sanders, thank you very much for the tour of your activities this morning and your statements. Thank you, Congressman Filner. Thank you, Madam Attorney General, for all the great work you do. I'd like to also say a word of appreciation for some others who are here who have not spoken today: our United States Attorney, Alan Bersin; the Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner, Doris Meissner; the person who was very active in helping me pass the crime bill which put these police officers on our streets, former Congresswoman Lynn Schenk, I am delighted to see you here. I want to thank all the officers who are here from the Customs, the Border Patrol, Immigration, from Chula Vista, from San Diego. I especially want to thank these uniformed officers who give their lives to make our lives safer and all the community citizens groups who work with them. Thank you all very much. Ladies and gentlemen, when I came to California and to San Diego 4 years ago and I listened and attempted to learn what was going on here, I saw an enormous amount of potential and a lot of stress. Mostly what people talked to me about then were two problems, the economy and the problem of crime and illegal immigration. I spent a lot of time here 4 years ago and had the opportunity to come back often since. If you will forgive me just one personal note, this is the first time I have come back to San Diego since the death of my friend Larry Lawrence, who served this country so well as our Ambassador to Switzerland, and I miss him now, coming back here, and I want to thank him for what he did for me here. Anyway, what we tried to do was to develop a serious approach, to work with you, to help you seize control of your destiny, and to help you do more of what you were already inclined to do. On the economy, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Because we are building two new ships for our national defense, the San Diego shipyards are busy, securing another 4,000 jobs until the year 2000. I think that is a good and positive step. Because in 1993 and 1994 the Congress agreed to invest in defense conversion, in high technology research and development and new environmental technologies and biotechnology, jobs are being created here that have a real future to grow in number and to strengthen and diversify the economy of this area. Because we have started work on a new sewage treatment plant and we are proposing to step up our sand reclamation efforts, thanks in no small measure to the relentless efforts of Congressman Filner, we are ensuring that the San Diego beaches will be enjoyed by children and their children for generations to come. But we all know that America has had, building over years and years and years, a serious problem of illegal immigration which has aggravated the crime problem along our borders. The Attorney General talked about some of the progress we have made. She gave me a report today which reviews where we are and what we have done. So as we have worked hard to bring the crime rate down all over America, we have made special efforts in our border communities, because we know that we have special responsibilities there. Immigration laws are national laws, not State laws. They have to be enforced, and the consequences of their enforcement or their failure to be enforced have to be borne primarily by the National Government. I have done what I could to get more money into California in very difficult fiscal circumstances in Washington to help you deal with the costs of illegal immigration-more than ever before- and I will continue to work on that. But the most important thing is we have to be able to work together to prove that we can do better. I agreed with what the district attorney said when he said there is a difference in being a safer community and a safe community. I agreed with what the sheriff said when he said that we'd never fully solve this problem until both the United States and our friends in Mexico are working together in a long-term and consistent way. But think about how far we have come in the last 3 1/2 years. Three and a half years ago, many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in America would return the very next day to commit crimes again. For a lot of years people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but did not do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words. It is a pretty good practice in a lot of areas of life, and I think it is worked pretty well here. Our message has been simple: We will work with you to give you the tools you need to patrol your streets, protect your children, secure our common border. And you have to do what you can to help the police to bring the crime rate down and make your community safe. Well, you heard what the prosecutor said: San Diego has the 5th lowest crime rate in the country of the 75 biggest urban areas. I actually believe when the numbers come out this year, you will be even lower than that. And it is a great tribute to the work that you have done together. Let me say, again, while the job is far from over-and we have a lot of work to do-the report I got from the Justice Department makes clear that we have begun to turn border communities under siege into communities where law and order and safety and security are once again the order of the day. I want to say too, again, I am glad that we are working to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America, that we are putting community policing in every community in the country that is willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it. Today I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the San Diego citizens patrol in the Safe Streets Now program. They are also helping your communities to be safer. The RSVP program is helping your community to be safer. So I ask you, do not stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you are surprised when you hear about a crime, then you will know you have got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it. The second thing we are doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they do not belong here in the first place, they are being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of January of last year, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem. We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We have added Border Patrol agents, in San Diego alone increasing by 762 the number of agents who are working for you by the end of this year. In El Paso, our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. Here in San Diego, control has been taken back of Imperial Beach from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built miles of new fences, installed thousands of watts of new lighting. There is more to do. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing San Diego residents in East County, particularly with the onset of the fire season. Today I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, to send 20 more law enforcement officers to Cleveland National Forest, and they will be there by the close of business today. Let me say one final word of appreciation here to the cooperation between the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials. What they have done here today, over the last several months-I mean, it ought to be something that we all take for granted. It ought to be the rule in every jurisdiction in America. It is a shame that it is rare, but it is rare, and we can be grateful that here there is one American law enforcement team. And I tell you, that is what we are trying to create for all the citizens of the United States, wherever they live. And I am very proud of what they have done. They have put aside politics and put the people of this community first, their safety first, their future first. That is why there has been an 84 percent increase in felony drug prosecutions in one year. That is why murders and robberies and car thefts have dropped so much, because they are all working together and working for you, instead of protecting their turf and playing politics. And I say, God bless them, we need more like them all over this country. Let me just say one other thing that affects Americans a long way from you, but I bet you have all identified with them in the past few months. Even as we crack down on illegal immigration and do more than has ever been done before on that, we must never forget that we are all a nation of immigrants and, except for the Native Americans, we all came from somewhere else. I say that to make this point: Our incredible diversity is a source of our rich potential as we move into this global society. Anybody who is willing to work hard, obey the law, respect their neighbors, and follow the values inherent in the Constitution ought to have a chance in America, and that ought to be the rule here. And because we are people and because we are imperfect, the country will always have problems. There will never be a time when there will be no problems. But we really fall into a dangerous trap when we start blaming our problems on other people just because they are different from us. I say that because even though I am a long way from there, my heart has been in my native South for the last several weeks as we have dealt with this incredible rash of church burnings. That is just another way of people finding a way-trying to blame somebody else or put down somebody else or put distance between them and someone else in a totally dehumanizing way, forgetting that everybody should be treated equally before the law, in the eyes of our fellow Americans, just as we are before God Almighty. And to burn a church is a terrible thing. Just 2 days ago, I reported to the American people about what we were doing to deal with the church bombings. And then barely a day later yet another congregation, this one in Greenville, Texas, found its church in flames. We have got to stop these things. We do have a team of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials working overtime to investigate these crimes. Just this morning, Federal investigators made an arrest for the burning of the church in Charlotte, North Carolina, last Thursday. And I do want you to know that for all the partisan fights you hear about in Washington, there is a bipartisan bill before the Congress, sponsored by a Democrat from Michigan, John Conyers, and a Republican from Illinois, Henry Hyde, to make it easier to prosecute anyone who attacks any house of worship, of any religious faith, of any race in America, and I urge Congress to pass it without delay. We need to come together as one America to rebuild our churches, restore hope, and show the forces of hatred they cannot win, just as we need to come together as one America to say we are a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws. If you want to be in our country, you should be here lawfully. We will protect our people. We will enforce our laws. We will secure our future. And we will do it together. Thank you, and God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia", "title": "Remarks to the Community in San Diego, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-community-san-diego-california", "publication_date": "10-06-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 1034, "text": "Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Distinguished Members of the Congress, Secretary Middendorf, Admiral Holloway, Admiral Cousins, Captain Compton, Mrs. Lay, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: At the outset, let me thank the Secretary of Defense for his more than generous comments, and let me simply reiterate the theme that he set forth. We are strong, we will continue to be strong, we will keep our commitments, and we will remain a great country. As each of us looks upon this great ship, a single thought must seize our minds: Only the United States of America can make a machine like this. There is nothing like her in the world today. We have witnessed the magic moment when an intricate mass of steel and cable and sophisticated marvels of engineering suddenly become a living thing with a unique personality. No matter how many commissionings you take part in, breaking the pennant and setting the first watch involves a special reward for all of us who love the sea and the United States Navy. I thank you very much, Captain Compton, and all of the ship's company for the privilege of being here. The Nimitz is now a United States Ship. I congratulate all who helped build her and all who man her, as well as their loved ones who-as many of you know better than I will do a lot of waiting for the sake of our country and of freedom everywhere. Their allegiance and their service to the country is also in the very best tradition of this great Nation. We all regret that Mrs. Chester W. Nimitz, St., cannot share this proud hour with all of us, but I am happy that Mrs. Lay and other members of the admiral's family are here. It is also gratifying to have Admiral Rickover here, for without these two farsighted submariners, Fleet Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Rickover, we would have no nuclear Navy. Few of us remember that it was Admiral Nimitz, as he was completing his career as Chief of Naval Operations in 1947, who recommended to the then Secretary of the Navy that the Bureau of Ships and the new Atomic Energy Commission get together to design and to build a nuclear propulsion plant for a submarine. Admiral Rickover took it from there. I see this great ship as a double symbol of today's challenging times. She is first of all a symbol of the United States, of our immense resources in materials and skilled manpower, of our inexhaustible energy, of the inventive and productive genius of our free, competitive economic system, and of our massive but controlled military strength. Wherever the United States Ship Nimitz shows her flag, she will be seen as we see her now, a solid symbol of United States strength, United States resolve made in America and manned by Americans. She is a movable part and parcel of our country, a self-contained city at sea plying the international waters of the world in defense of our national interests. Whether her mission is one of defense, diplomacy, or humanity, the Nimitz will command awe and admiration from some, caution and circumspection from others, and respect from all. There is no need for me to dwell on the importance of aircraft carriers in today's and tomorrow's defense planning though as an old carrier man myself, I might like that role. During recent days, I think it is worthy to note, we have seen the most convincing demonstration of their readiness and their flexibility in the successful execution of national policy. Without the five aircraft carriers which served as the nucleus of our forces operating off South Vietnam, without the skill and the heroic performance of Marine Corps and naval aviation and support personnel, without the Air Force helicopter crews who operated from the carrier decks, we could not have rescued all of the remaining American citizens and thousands of endangered Vietnamese from Saigon within 20 hours. And I congratulate, on behalf of all of you, the work that was done on that occasion. The Nimitz joins the fleet at an auspicious moment when our determination to strengthen our tics with allies across both great oceans and to work for peace and stability around the world requires clear demonstration. Along with our other forces worldwide, the Nimitz will make critically important contributions in our continuing quest for a peaceful planet, a planet whose surface is more than 70 percent ocean. As I see the United States Ship Nimitz as a symbol of the vast power, the protective or productive skill and economic strength of America, so will others around the world. To all, this great ship is visible evidence of our commitment to friends and allies and our capability to maintain those commitments. But for Americans, especially, she is also a symbol of the man whose name she bears. The grandson of a seafaring German immigrant, who grew up in the great State of Texas and never lost his pride in his native State, Chester W. Nimitz started from the smoke of Pearl Harbor and carried the fight to the enemy. His superb leadership and the valor of more than 2 million American fighting men culminated on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri 4 years later, as he signed the Japanese surrender as commander in chief of the largest naval armada ever assembled. Looking back on a period of my own life, one of the things of which I am the proudest is that I can say, I served under Admiral Nimitz in the Pacific. As a lowly lieutenant on the U.S.S. Monterey, a carrier you could probably stow on the hangar deck of the Nimitz, I saw very little of fleet admirals during World War II. But every watch officer could recognize the crisp CINCPAC dispatches that Admiral Nimitz obviously had written in his own hand. One biographer who did not know him or who, I should say, did know him Professor E. B. Potter of the Naval Academy, summed up Admiral Nimitz' qualities in simple words that well serve as a model for anyone who aspires to leadership in any line of endeavor. And I quote from Professor Potter: He surrounded himself with the ablest men he could find and sought their advice, but he made his own decisions. He was a keen strategist who never forgot that he was dealing with human beings, on both sides of the conflict. He was aggressive in war without hate, audacious while never failing to weigh the risks. Admiral Nimitz, of all the great American commanders of World War II, was one of the most self-effacing and, certainly, one of the most effective. He possessed great stamina, an abundance of common sense, and such immense inner strength that he felt no need to strut or to shout. Born near what today we would call the poverty level, he worked hard, he studied hard, and was a long, long time getting ahead. He spent his whole life training to serve his country in commanding men at sea, and when he was needed, he was prepared. He learned by his mistakes and was tolerant of others, but he was always in command. Those who had the good fortune to know Admiral Nimitz will say his fundamental honesty, intellectual honesty and integrity, enabled him to keep a steady course toward his ultimate objective without yielding to the tremendous pressures of his vast responsibilities. He did the job he was prepared to do, did it superbly, hung up his sword and filled his final years with quiet service to his country and to the cause of peace. Repeatedly urged to write his wartime memoirs, Admiral Nimitz just as repeatedly refused. To do so, he explained, would compel him either to hurt the reputations of some fine shipmates or tell some whopping lies. His own philosophy, in his own words, has long been a personal inspiration to me. Typically, he credited it to his seafaring grandfather. The sea, like life itself is a stern taskmaster, he recalled. The best way to get along with either is to learn all you can, then do your best, and do not worry especially about things over which you have no control. So, this great ship is a symbol of a great sea commander and a great American, one whose common virtues magnified by the stern demands of duty turned defeat into victory and made the broad Pacific again worthy of its name. It is my determination to keep it that way, the way all oceans and all continents ought to be. But Fleet Admiral Nimitz and this fine ship both tell us that controlled strength is the sure guarantor of peace. Let us all and particularly those who serve in the United States Ship Nimitz, now and hereafter-rededicate ourselves to this principle and to unstinting service to our country and to its people.

{"id": 632, "text": "One of the wonderful experiences that is enjoyed by the men who've lived in this house and served here is to meet outstanding people from around the world, and particularly from his own Nation. It is not possible to recognize in any tangible way the literally tens of thousands, even more, Americans who serve unselfishly and who serve with distinction and who garner, because of their service, the legitimate debt and thanks of their fellow citizens. A number of years ago President Harry Truman initiated the Presidential Medal of Freedom to single out a few distinguished Americans to represent that superb service. When a few are chosen, it is done without derogation of those not chosen. It is done as an exemplification of honor in a democracy among citizens who are all equal. I have been quite reticent, compared to some of my predecessors, about the number who have been selected. The first ceremony that I had in 1977 I honored Martin Luther King, Jr., and Jonas Salk; later, Arthur Goldberg, Margaret Meade, Ansel Adams, Rachel Carson, Lucia Chase, Hubert Humphrey, Archbishop Lakovos, Lyndon Johnson, Clarence Mitchell, Jr., Roger Tory Peterson, Admiral Hyman Rickover, Beverly Sills, Robert Penn Warren, John Wayne, Eudora Welty, and Tennessee Williams. As you listen to those names, one of the first questions that comes to mind is why were not they honored long ago? And I feel that way about some of those who will be honored today. Four of our honorees cannot be here, and I will explain to you why as their names are called. I would like now for the military aide to come forward to present the certificates to me, and I will read the citation and perhaps say a few extra words. As I do, those who are present please come forward. Those who have representatives, come forward in their place, and I will award the medals at that time. These are done not in order of seniority or age, but according to alphabetical listing of the last names. From the government of science to the science of government, Harold Brown has served his country first and his principles always. As an advisor to Presidents, and a president of a community of scholars, he has helped bridge the gap between the world of theory and the world of reality. Adept at translating from the language of science to the language of statecraft, he excels in translating purpose into action. I have worked and served with Harold Brown for 4 years. He is a man of strength and a man of peace. He is brought levelheaded judgment to one of the major departments of our country in times of testing, in times of potential war. But because of his sound judgment and the trust that others have in him, he has preserved our Nation as it should be, strong and peaceful. It is with a great deal of honor that I present the Medal of Freedom to Harold Brown. Zbigniew Brzezinski served his country and the world. An author and architect of world affairs, his strategic vision of America's purpose fused principle with strength. His leadership has been instrumental in building peace and ending the estrangement of the Chinese and American people. But above all, he helped set our nation irrevocably on a course that honors America's abiding commitment to human rights. I doubt that anyone in my own administration has been more controversial than Dr. Brzezinski. And the reason for it is manifold, but I'd like to make two reasons. One is that he is evocative; he is a person who explores constantly better ways to do things. His Eastern European origins have given him an almost unmatched understanding of the interrelationships among the cultural entities of the Soviet Union and the satellite countries. He came here early in his life seeking freedom. He is a clear spokesman. I do not know of a single time in the last 4 years when he has ever made a public statement of any kind, privately or publicly which was not compatible with my own policies. The other reason that he has been somewhat controversial is that he has never tried to take credit for a success, nor has he ever tried to blame me as President, or anyone else, for a failure. To me, this is a wonderful evidence of courage, because it is so easy for someone who works within the inner circles of the White House in particular and other places of leadership when something goes wrong, very quietly, very subtly to say, I recommended one thing; ENTITY or the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense did something else. Zbigniew Brzezinski has never done that. I am deeply indebted to him, and I think that the Nation shares that debt with me. It is with a great deal of pride and gratitude that I present the Medal of Freedom to Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski. I look around the room and people who know the alphabet and who work very closely with me are smiling with anticipation about the next award. I might say that Warren Christopher is in Algiers working as he has for the last 14 months for the freedom of the American hostages. He is listening to my voice through an open telephone line, and I'd like to read this citation. Warren Christopher has the tact of a true diplomat, the tactical skills of a great soldier, the analytical ability of a fine lawyer, and the selfless dedication of a citizen-statesman. His perseverance and loyalty, judgment and skill have won for his country new respect around the world and new regard for the State Department here at home. Signed, Jimmy Carter, this date, White House. Last week I was in Plains, and I was invited out to a small French restaurant between Plains and Americus by the press; it is one of the few French restaurants between Plains and Americus. And when I sat at the table eating supper, we had an informal off-the-record discussion, and the members of the press asked me, Of all the public servants with whom you have served as President, who would you rank number one? And I did not hesitate a moment. I said, Warren Christopher. I think that those others who are being honored here today and all those that have worked with me would agree that he is indeed outstanding. I am indebted to him, and so is the Nation, far beyond what the general public knows. And it is with a great deal of pleasure and pride and honor that I present this Medal of Freedom to his lovely wife for Warren Christopher, a distinguished American. For thousands of nights, the eyes and can of millions of Americans have been tuned in to the eyes and ears of Walter Cronkite. He has reported and commented on the events of the last two decades with a skill and insight which stands out in the news world, in a way which has made the news of the world stand out for all of us. There is probably not a single American who does not know Walter Cronkite, and of those tens of millions who know him, I do not believe there are any who distrust him. When our Nation has had great achievements, his voice has explained the significance of it, whether we have achieved peace when it was doubtful or when a man has landed on the Moon. And when our Nation has been in trouble or made mistakes and there was a danger that our public might react adversely or even panic on occasion, the calm and reassuring demeanor and voice and the inner character of Walter Cronkite has been reassuring to us all. He is a man superb on his own, but who has exemplified in the finest way the profession which he represents. And on behalf of all Americans, I extend my congratulations and my appreciation to a distinguished American, a public servant, Waiter Cronkite. Acclaimed as a screen actor and director here at home, Kirk Douglas has often played a different role abroad. Acting as an ambassador of good will beyond our shores, he has travelled around the world for our State Department and the United States Information Agency. The son of Russian immigrants, he travels, too, for the opportunity to share with other peoples his love of film, and country. I have know Kirk Douglas personally and appreciate his friendship. But more than that, I have known how dedicated he is to using his talent as an actor and a director and the esteem with which he is held by his own people in spreading the good news about this country and explaining our purposes, our ideals, our commitments, and our achievements, our hopes, and our dreams to people around the world. He is done this in a sacrificial way, almost invariably without fanfare and without claiming any personal credit or acclaim for himself. And so, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I give him this recognition and admire his modesty and thank him for what he has meant and what he still means and will mean to the country which he loves. Margaret Craig McNamara saw a need in our society, and filled it. By creating the Reading is fundamental program, which has provided youngsters all over this country with millions of books, she has opened new doors in the minds of our young people and has given fresh meaning to the lives of the parents, teachers and volunteers who have joined her program. The other night, I think in this room, I spoke to a group of people who represented local and State government in an official capacity, and I reminded them that the things that occupy our mind and to which we are dedicated are the simple things of life-things like a mother, a baby, retarded children, love for the elderly, the quality of a classroom, gentleness, love, peace, the purity of air, quietness-those kinds of things are what we try to preserve and enhance. Margaret Craig McNamara has taken this kind of commitment very long ago, when she saw two young men, I believe; talked to them quietly, found that they had never owned a book, were not interested in reading. And she had just a simple idea of getting books and not lending them to people but letting them own their own. Since then tens of millions of books have been collected through her leadership and given to young people. It has transformed their lives. There are hundreds of centers now all over this Nation. And she has marshaled tens of thousands of people to help in this program. She is done it quietly, because she loves others. She is dedicated a major part of her life to this effort, a simple thing of through reading, stretching the minds and the hearts of young people who would not otherwise know how great God's world is and would not know much about their fellow human beings. She is the kind of person who is an inspiration to all Americans who love others. And it is with a great deal of pride that I present this Medal of Freedom to Margaret Craig McNamara. Dr. Menninger, as you may have anticipated, is busy enhancing the mental treatment qualities of this Nation. He is on the west coast, and honored by this award, of course, he still asked that he be excused so he could continue his work uninterrupted. A not so valuable nephew, Dr. Roy Menninger- -has volunteered to come forward to accept the award for his uncle. And I would like to read the award now. Karl Menninger has taught us much about ourselves and our behavior. An acute observer and social critic, he has put into action what he has put onto paper. As an author and doctor, his works range from popular, written accounts of psychiatry to studies done in his own hospital, from creating homes for parentless children to reforming the penal system. With the wisdom of his years, he truly does represent the ideas of another generation-one of the future, rather than of the past.] All of those in this room who have been interested in improving the quality of mental health of this Nation have heard the name Karl Menninger since many years ago. He has been a pioneer, but as the closing phrase of this citation reminds us, he has never looked backward. He has always looked forward. His entire family has made the Menninger Clinic what it stands for, a powerful factor for a better life for Americans, not just in its own neighborhood but throughout the world. And with his research and with his writing, with his lecturing, with his training of other doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and others, he has literally transformed the mental health care attitudes of our great Nation. To Dr. Roy Menninger, I want to express my deep thanks for accepting this award on behalf of his uncle and express my thanks also to the entire Menninger family. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I present this award to Dr. Roy Menninger for Dr. Karl Menninger. As Senator and Secretary of State, candidate and citizen, Edmund S. Muskie has captured for himself a place in the public eye and the public's heart. Devoted to his nation and our ideals, he has performed heroically in a time of great challenge, with great fortitude in an era of change. If Ed were going to rewrite this citation, he would certainly insert the word Governor. I remember when we had the swearing-in ceremony in this room not too long ago, Ed pointed out that his love for the Governorship equaled my own, and I think those who have served in that position would agree that this is a wonderful opportunity for service before one comes to Washington to serve our whole Nation. Ed Muskie has been a man whom I have admired ever since I have been aware of his public service and been interested myself in going into the political arena. He has performed all of his official functions admirably with a quiet sense of inner strength and demonstrated courage. He has never yielded to temptation to lower his own standards or the standards which make all public servants proud. He is a man who has transcended in all his service any particular delineation of a political party, but has stayed a loyal Democrat at the same time. He is a man admired by all and the admiration is richly deserved. I am particularly grateful to Ed Muskie, because he was willing to leave a sure seat in the Senate to come and serve in a very difficult position as Secretary of State in this time of transition or change. It is not an easy time. But he did it with conviction that this was the best place for him to give his tremendous talents for the further service of his fellow Americans. He is a personal friend, as many of these honorees are, and personally and as President of our country, I am delighted and proud to award the Medal of Freedom to Ed Muskie. Once government's highest ranking woman, Esther Peterson still ranks highest among consumer advocates. She has advised Presidents and the public, and has worked for labor and business alike, always keeping the rights of all Americans to know and to be treated fairly as her highest priority. Even her staunchest foes respect her integrity and are warmed by her grace and sincere concern. You may be surprised that in the citation the word foes is mentioned in relation to this lovely American, but she has made some foes. And I would guess, knowing her, that she is prouder of the foes she has made- -if possible, 'than even some of the friends she has. She has never been afraid to address difficult issues even at the expense on occasion of personal harmony with those about whom she cares. She serves others with her entire dedicated life. She is come to the inner circles of the White House in a major position during these last few years to work with me to make sure that the average American is not cheated, that they are told the truth, that they are treated fairly, and that when they go into the marketplace they can have some inner sense of trust in the free enterprise system which she has served so well. She is a delightful person, a person with charm, a person who makes deep friendships and deep commitments. And her deepest commitment has been to those who do not know her and who will probably never see her or maybe not even hear her voice. She serves those who are most deprived and has done that with her whole life. I love her personally, and I congratulate her on receiving this award, the Medal of Freedom of our country. Gerard C. Smith has represented our country in many capacities-as the first U.S. Chairman of the Trilateral Commission, as chief U.S. delegate to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1969. In helping formulate our national security policy, in promoting a better understanding of foreign relations, he has helped us all to perceive that in this nuclear age security and peace are indivisible. In my farewell address the other night, I emphasized one subject perhaps greater than any other, and that is the control of nuclear weapons throughout the world. One way to control nuclear weapons is to have an agreement, a binding agreement, between ourselves and the Soviet Union, the other superpower, to control and to limit and hopefully to reduce, ultimately to eliminate nuclear weapons altogether. The other way is to make sure that the world understands the threat of nuclear weaponry and the threat of a nuclear war and that we can impose a policy of nonproliferation, to prevent the spread of nuclear weaponry to other nations around the world. Gerry Smith has been involved from the very beginning of our Nation's policy of nonproliferation. He is been a teacher of leaders in this country and around the world. He is put forward our own Nation's programs and policies with distinction and commitment and tenacity. He is a great negotiator, a very successful one, and he is responsible now for the SALT treaty which is binding upon and has been for many years binding upon our Nation and the Soviet Union. Our country is indebted to Gerry Smith. And as President, I am personally indebted to him as well. I want to say at this time that I congratulate him; I am honored to present the Medal of Freedom to a fine American who has served us well, Gerard C. Smith. For Americans politics is the art of the possible. Through intelligence, ability, and the many friendships earned during his service as the leader of his party and his Nation, Robert S. Strauss has refined that art into a science. With diligence, persistence, and wit, he successfully concluded the multilateral trade negotiations at a time when many believed that they were doomed for failure. For strengthening the system of trade which links the nations of our increasingly interdependent world he has earned our gratitude and respect. The first time I went to an international forum to meet with the leaders of other great Western nations-Japan, Canada, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, France-I asked them about the longstanding effort to conclude a multilateral trade agreement that would enhance the quality of life, the productivity, the exchange of goods, the enhancement of peace among all the nations of the Western world. Chancellor Schmidt, President Giscard d'Estaing, at that time Prime Minister Callaghan, all told me this was a fruitless wish, that the Multilateral Trade Negotiations were dead. I decided to ask Bob Strauss to give it a try. And he succeeded. Not only did he succeed in bringing the multiple nations together in one of the most complex negotiating efforts that I have ever seen, but he came back and convinced the Members of Congress-Democrats, Republicans, House and Senate that the very complicated agreements that he had negotiated and which, I would guess, many of them never read, were in the best interest of our country, in the best interest of their constituents, and would do them credit on the next election day. And the Multilateral Trade Negotiation Act passed the Congress overwhelmingly. As a matter of fact, it passed so easily, that there were no violent altercations or major debates, and the event almost escaped the notice of the press, even CBS Evening News. But it was a notable achievement, and it was one that utilized the tremendous talents of this good man. Later, Bob Strauss helped to negotiate peace between Israel and Egypt, pursuing the Camp David accords and the treaty that had been signed. And I think everyone who knows him would say that his understanding of the people of this country, his ability to get along with people of diverse views, and his ability to bring people together in an agreement that enhances the quality of life of all Americans is indeed outstanding. He is a man, as the citation says, of wit and competence and integrity. And I am very proud to present the Medal of Freedom to Robert Strauss. Elbert Tuttle is a true judicial hero. At a time when it was unpopular to do so, he carried out the mandate of Supreme Court decisions and Congressional legislation to end racial discrimination in the Deep South. With steadfast courage and a deep love and understanding of the region, he has helped to make the Constitutional principle of equal protection a reality of American life. Those of us who have lived in the South during the time when racial discrimination was ended by the courts are perhaps the only ones here who can adequately appreciate the courage of a Federal judge like Elbert Tuttle. His decisions not only required the knowledge of the law and courage. They required a character and an earned degree of esteem from his fellow Georgians and his fellow southerners that would add additional weight to his decisions. When the people in my region would read that Judge Elbert Tuttle had ruled this way, we had a natural sense that even though some may not agree, it must be right. I am indebted to him personally. Both I and one of the honorees would probably never be here in the White House on this day had it not been for Elbert Tuttle and men like him. He is a man of brilliant mind. He can handle complex legal decisions easily, but he is a man of simple commitments and ideals. When he was interviewed at the time of his retirement from the Federal bench on national television, the interviewer said, Judge Tuttle, I understand that you have never drunk alcoholic beverages, and Judge Tuttle said, That is right. And the interviewer said, Would you mind telling our television audience why? And Judge Tuttle said, Because my mother told me not to. I have thought about that a lot. And a lot of people in this Nation did what was right because Judge Tuttle said, That is what we ought to do. I am honored to present to him the Medal of Freedom. Federal Judge Elbert Tuttle. Earl Warren led a unanimous court that in turn led the Nation in reversing a century of judicial and social history. By affirming that separate is not equal, he and his court reaffirmed the truth of the words carved in stone at the entrance to the Supreme Court: Equal Justice For All. As governor, presidential candidate and Chief Justice, he has truly been a citizen for all seasons. As I stood here this afternoon, I tried to think of any man who has served in the White House as President who has benefited our Nation as much or more than Earl Warren-and I cannot think of anybody. There comes a time in the evolution of society when a certain quality of understanding and integrity and leadership is a prerequisite to further progress. When hopeless, perhaps, but courageous people are being frustrated, when the times call for change, but ordinary human beings cannot bring themselves to make the change because they might be criticized by their peers or those whom they would like to please, and when the trend of history must be modified or even reversed, I thank God that Earl Warren was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in a time like that. And with his decision, he helped to realize the aspirations and ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of our Nation. His predecessors had not adequately done it. He departed from some longstanding decisions that they had made. I say that without criticizing them. But it took a special man to make those difficult decisions that Judge Tuttle and others followed in the administration of justice and the enhancement of equality of opportunity under the law for all the people of our Nation. Miss Nina has come here representing her late husband, and I am honored especially to present the Medal of Freedom to the beloved wife of one of the finest Americans who ever served in any capacity in the Government of our Nation, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Earl Warren. I would like to say before I present the last medal here that Roger Baldwin, a great civil rights leader, is in the hospital in New Jersey. At 3 o'clock this afternoon, the same time as we began our ceremony here, he was presented with a Medal of Freedom by William Vanden Heuvel, Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, on my behalf. Founder of the American Civil Liberties Union and the International League for Human Rights, Roger Nash Baldwin is a leader in the field of civil rights and a legend in the field of civil liberties. He is a national resource, and an international one as well, an inspiration to those of us who have fought for human rights, a saint to those for whom he has gained them. Andrew Young brought to diplomatic service a lifetime of dedication to human rights. He helped restore trust in the United States among Third World nations, especially in Africa, demonstrating to them that American foreign policy was based on our firm belief in justice, freedom, majority rule, and opportunity for all people. I first heard about Andrew Young when I read news reports that he was in jail along with Martin Luther King, Jr., and when I saw his photographs in the newspaper seeking, with danger to his own life, to prove that our Constitution and the rulings of Earl Warren and Judge Tuttle ought to be put into effect by human beings. He is a man of quiet demeanor, having served as a United States Congressman from my State. When I was elected President, one of my major goals was to enhance human rights and to strengthen the ties of friendship and understanding and mutual respect between our Nation and the small, sometimes weak, new nations of the world, those whose people might be black or brown or yellow and who in the past had sometimes distrusted our country because there was a lack of understanding on our own leaders' part of them. I asked Andy Young to leave the Congress and to serve as our U.N. Ambassador. He did it reluctantly. But when he went to the United Nations he served our Nation superbly. Sometimes I have to admit I was surprised by some of the statements that Andy made, and I do not agree with all of them and did not then. But if you listen closely to what he says, in the context of his statement, you see the wisdom and the continued purpose of his life expressed not just locally or domestically, but internationally. Throughout the Asian countries, the South American countries, the African countries, and many others, Andy Young is the brightest star in the American firmament. He is the man who represents integrity and understanding, humility, purpose, and who exemplifies the quiet teachings of his Saviour, whom he represents as a preacher of the gospel. He is carried on well along with Coretta and others the heritage of Martin Luther King, Jr., and I am deeply grateful for what Andy has meant to me personally, to me as President, and to our Nation. His beneficial service will help our Nation in many years ahead, and he is done it always with humility and with a quiet sense of calm, because he was sure that what he did was right for others. I have never known a person more unselfish than Andrew Young. And the respect that he enjoys around the world is well-deserved. I am honored to present the Medal of Freedom to Ambassador, former Congressman, great American, Andrew Young. Can I ask all of the recipients of the medal to come up on the platform perhaps now for a photograph, and then we will adjourn the meeting.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspresidentialmedalfreedomremarksthepresentationceremony0", "title": "Presidential Medal of Freedom Remarks at the Presentation Ceremony.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-medal-freedom-remarks-the-presentation-ceremony-0", "publication_date": "16-01-1981", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 569, "text": "Mr. President, in America we call this is bringing the press in out of the cold. Laugh a little bit. That was pretty good. You guys have to admit that. Anyway, I am glad to see you again after a successful summit we had, the Summit of the Americas, in June, and to be able to return a small amount of hospitality your family showed my wife Jill when she visited Quito over the spring. She enjoyed it so much I was not sure she was coming home. Today we are going to keep building on the progress we have made. Together, we have made historic strides on migration. And this afternoon we will discuss how we can deepen our security and our economic partnership even further than it is right now. That includes our new joint investment programs that address security needs for Ecuador's prison system, your justice sector, and your maritime security. And, Mr. President, since we both understand that working families are the backbone of both our economies, I look forward to discussing how we can keep delivering for those families under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity. In both our countries. And, finally, I want to thank you for your moral leadership, your condemnation of Putin's brutal war against the Ukrainian people that continues in ways we have not seen for a generation. You and I are united not only in our values, but in our vision of the future, one that is both free and democratic. And in the new year, as Ecuador begins its term on the U.N. Security Council, I look forward to continuing to work together to make this vision a reality. And I want to thank you very much for making the effort to be here. And as they used to say in the legislative body I worked, the United States Senate: The floor is yours. President Lasso. Thank you very much, Mr. President. For me it is also a pleasure to here-to be here with you after our very nice visit together in Los Angeles and also after that very pleasant visit with you and your wife Jill in Quito. So, with-for us, this is a great opportunity to come here and to reaffirm the democratic freedom and human rights values that we share with the glorious people of the U.S. Without a doubt, yes, we have been allies for decades now. And I am here to reaffirm that spirit that we share among us as allies, too, in our fight for democracy, for peace, and for justice, not only in the region, but also to support your vision throughout the world. So we were the first country in Latin America to condemn the awful war from Russia into Ukraine. We believe in multilateralism, and we also believe in the rule of law. And we also support dialogue as the means for solving differences and disputes. It is really remarkable to see that after a pandemic we are now facing a war. So we will have a chance, after we visit with our friends of the press, to share more on the issues we have in common. President Biden. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. We have a lot to talk about. You have been a great friend and a significant supporter, and that goes both ways. And we have to figure out how to expand and strengthen even an already strong relationship. And I want to thank the press for coming in. We are going to send you back out in the cold.

{"id": 736, "text": "Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate Mary Peters to be the next Secretary of Transportation. Our Nation's transportation infrastructure is vital to our prosperity and competitiveness; it is critical to the everyday lives of our citizens. The Secretary of Transportation is responsible for maintaining a safe, reliable, and efficient transportation system. In addition, the Secretary of Transportation plays an important role in our Nation's coordinated efforts to guard against terrorist threats to our aircraft, our seaports, and our infrastructure. It is the job that requires vision and strong leadership. Mary Peters is the right person for this job. She brings a lifetime of experience on transportation issues, from both the private and public sectors. She now serves as a senior executive for transportation policy at a major engineering firm. Before that, Mary served in my administration as the head of the Federal Highway Administration. As Administrator, Mary led efforts to improve safety and security, reduce traffic congestion, and modernize America's roads and bridges. And before coming to Washington, Mary served in the Arizona Department of Transportation for more than 15 years, rising through the ranks to become the director in 1998. Mary has a reputation for character and common sense. She is an innovative thinker. She knows how to set priorities and to solve problems. And as a member of my Cabinet, Mary will work closely with State and local leaders to ensure that America has a state-of-the-art transportation system that meets the needs of our growing economy. When confirmed by the Senate, Mary will succeed one of our Nation's finest Secretaries of Transportation in Norm Mineta. When I came to Washington, I asked Norm to continue his service by joining my Cabinet. And he shows that when we put politics aside, people from different political parties can work together to achieve results for the American people. He was the Secretary of Transportation on September the 11th, 2001, and he led the unprecedented effort to bring tens of thousands of passengers aboard commercial aircraft to safe landings. And since then, he is worked to strengthen the security at America's airports and seaports. He is played a critical role in keeping America safe from terrorist attacks. Norm also worked hard to modernize the aviation market. And after Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team swung into action to repair and reopen major highways and seaports and airports and pipelines along America's gulf coast. Norm Mineta has served America with integrity and dedication and distinction. He leaves office as the longest serving Secretary of Transportation in our Nation's history. I appreciate Norm's lifetime of service to our country. I wish him and Deni and all his family all the best. I also want to thank Maria Cino for her outstanding leadership of the Department since Norm stepped down in July. Mary Peters knows the legacy she has to live up to at the Department of Transportation. She will take this new post during a time of historic challenges for our economy and our transportation system. I want to thank Mary for her willingness to serve yet again. She is going to make an outstanding Secretary of Transportation, and I call upon the United States Senate to confirm her promptly. Congratulations.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenominationmaryepetersbesecretarytransportation", "title": "Remarks on the Nomination of Mary E.

{"id": 619, "text": "Thank you very much. I want to, first of all, thank all of you for coming, the Members of Congress of both parties, members of our administration, but the larger community represented here in this room and at all of our sites. This has been a truly remarkable experience, I think, for all of us-stimulating, moving, humbling. I think it is because it is so real, and it has been too long since we have come together over something that is this real, that touches so many of us. This is a moment of great hope for people who are living with mental illness and, therefore, a moment of great promise for our Nation. We know a lot about it; we know a lot more than most of us know we know, as we found out today. And we wanted to have this conference to talk about how far we have come and also to look forward into the future. We all know we would not be here today without the commitment of Tipper Gore. I asked her to be my national adviser for mental illness because she knows more and cares more about this issue than anyone else I personally know. She has dedicated herself to making this a priority of national policy and private life. And I think we are all very, very much in her debt. I would also like to say one more word about Tipper and about the Vice President, about the way they have dealt with this issue as a family and the gifts they have given to America, going back to before the time when we all became a team in the election of 1992, when they began their annual family conferences. All people in public life talk about family values. No couple in public life has ever done remotely as much to try to figure out what it would mean to turn those family values into real, concrete improvements in the lives of ordinary families as Al and Tipper Gore have over a long period of time. I sort of feel like an anticlimax at this convention-not for the reasons the political reporters think--but because the real story here is in the people who have already talked, in their stories of courage and struggle, of endurance and hope. Americans with mental illness should have the same opportunity all Americans have to live to the fullest of their God-given ability. They are, perhaps, just the latest in our enduring challenge as a people to continue the work of our Founders, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of freedom, to strengthen the bonds of our community. But what a challenge it has been. Clearly, people with mental illnesses have always had to struggle to be treated fairly and to get the treatment they need-and they still do. We have made a lot of progress by appealing to the better angels of our nature, by drawing on our deep belief in equality, but also by hearing these stories. So again, I want to thank Mike and John and Jennifer and Robin and Dr. Burton. I thank Dr. Hyman, Dr. Koplewicz. I thank Lynn Rivers. I think all of us can remember some moment in our lives where, because of something that happened in our families or something someone we knew wrote or said, we began to look at this issue in a different way. I, myself, feel particularly indebted to the courage of my friend the great author William Styron for writing the book he wrote about his own depression. But I think that it is not enough to be moved. We have to have hope, and then we have to have some sense about where we are going. It was no accident that all of you were clapping loudly when Dr. Hyman showed us pictures of the brain. I remember when Hillary and I first met and began going together 28 years ago, and she was working at the Yale Child Study Center and the hospital, and we began to talk about all of this. Like a lot of young students at the time, I had been very influenced by Thomas Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolution. And I began to wonder whether we would ever develop a completely unified theory of mind and body, if we would ever learn that at root there are no artificial dividing lines between our afflictions. The human genome project, as you have heard explained today, offers us the best chance we have ever had to have our science match our aspirations in learning to deal with this and all other issues. So this has been for me not simply emotionally rewarding but intellectually reaffirming. And I hope it has been for all of you. We have been at this for quite a long while. A hundred and fifty years ago we had to learn to treat people with mental illness as basic human beings. Thirty years ago we had to learn that people with mental illness had to be treated as individuals, not just a faceless mob. I will never forget when journalists secretly filmed the nightmare world inside some of our Nation's mental hospitals. Americans were heartbroken and horrified by what they saw, and we began to develop a system of community care for people. Today, we have to make sure that we actually provide the care all of our people need, so they can live full lives and fully participate in our common life. We have worked hard to break down some of the barriers for people living with mental illness. On Friday, as many of you know, I directed all Federal agencies to ensure that their hiring practices give people with mental disabilities the same employment opportunities as people with physical disabilities. On Saturday Tipper and I did the radio address together and announced that Tipper will unveil our new campaign to fight stigma and dispel myths about mental illness. But all of you who have had this in your lives, or in your families' lives, know that attitudes are fine, but treatment matters most. Unfortunately, too many people with mental illness are not getting that treatment because too many of our health plans and businesses do not provide equal coverage of parity for mental and physical illness or because of the inadequacy of Government funding and policy supports. I have heard heartbreaking stories from people who are trying hard to take care of their families, and one day mental illness strikes. And when they try to get help, they learn the health plans they have been counting on, the plans that would cover treatment for high blood pressure or heart disease, strictly limit mental health care and do not cover it at all. Why? Because of ignorance about the nature of mental illness, the cost of treating it, and as Dr. Burton told us, the cost of not treating it. A recent study showed the majority of Americans do not believe mental illness can accurately be diagnosed or effectively treated. If we do not get much else out of this historic conference than changing the attitudes of the majority, it will have been well done, just on that score. Insurance plans claim providing parity for mental health will send costs and premiums skyrocketing. Businesses believe employees will over-use mental health services, making it impossible for employers to offer health insurance. Now, there may be arguments to be made at the margins on both sides of these issues, but I believe that providing parity is something we can do at reasonable cost, benefit millions of Americans, and over the long run, have a healthier country and lower health care costs. As we have heard again today, mental illness can be accurately diagnosed, successfully treated, just as physical illness. New drugs, better community health services are helping even people with the most severe mental illnesses lead healthier, more productive lives. Our ability to treat depression and bipolar disorder is greater even than our ability to treat some kinds of heart disease. But left untreated, mental illness can spiral out of control, and so can the cost of mental health care. A recent World Bank study showed that mental illness is a leading cause of disability and economic burden that goes along with it. Here in the United States, untreated mental illness costs tens of billions of dollars every year. The loss in human potential is staggering. So far, 24 States and a large number of businesses have begun to provide parity for their citizens and their employees. Reports show that parity is not notably increasing health care costs. For instance, Ohio provides full parity for all its State employees and has not seen costs rise. As we heard, Bank One's employee mental health treatment program has helped it reduce direct treatment costs for depression by 60 percent. As a nation founded on the ideal of equality, it is high time that our health plans treat all Americans equally. Government can and must lead the way to meet this challenge. In 1996 I called on Congress to make parity for mental health a priority. I was proud to sign into law the Mental Health Parity Act, which prohibited health plans for setting lower annual and lifetime limits for mental health care than for other medical services. Again I want to say, since we have so many Congressmen here, Tipper Gore was very instrumental in that. But I was also deeply moved by the broad and deep bipartisan support by Members of Congress in both Houses who had personal experiences that they shared with other Members which helped to change America. The law was a good first step. And I am pleased to announce, with Secretary Herman here, that the Labor Department will now launch a nationwide effort to educate Americans about their rights under the existing law, because a lot of people do not even know it passed. But when insurers can get around the law by limiting the number of doctor's visits for mental condition, when families face higher copayments for mental health care than for physical ailments, when people living with mental illness are forced to wait until their sickness incapacitates them to get the treatment they need, we know we have to do more. So where do we go from here? First, I am using my authority as President to ensure that our Nation's largest private insurer, the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan, provides full parity for mental health. Today Janice Lachance, the Director of OPM, will inform nearly 300 health plans across America that to participate in our program, they must provide equal coverage for mental and physical illnesses. With this single step, 9 million Americans will have health insurance that provides the same copayments for mental health conditions as for any other health condition, the same access to specialists, the same coverage for medication, the same coverage for outpatient care. Thirty-six years ago President Kennedy said we had to return mental health to the mainstream of American medicine. Thirty-six years ago he said it, and we are still waiting. Today, we have to take more steps to return Americans to the mainstream of American life. I ask Congress now to do its part by holding hearings on mental health parity. The second thing we have to do is to reach out to the people who are most in need. Today I have asked HCFA, the Health Care Finance Administration, to do more to encourage States to better coordinate mental health services, from medication to programs targeted at people with the most serious mental disorders, for the millions of people with mental illness who rely on Medicaid. Third, we must do more to help people with mental illness reenter the work force. I asked Congress to pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act, which will allow people with disabilities to purchase health insurance at a reasonable cost when they go back to work. No American should ever have to choose between keeping health care and supporting their family. Fourth, with an ever-increasing number of people with mental disabilities in managed care plans, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. Fifth, this year we requested the largest increase in history, some $70 million to help more communities provide more mental health services. And I asked Congress to fully fund this proposal. The absence of services and adequate funding and institutional support for sometimes even the most severe mental health problems is a source of profound worry to those of you who actually know what is going on out there. I know that I was incredibly moved by the cover story in the New York Times Sunday magazine a couple of weeks ago, and I know a lot of you were. And I read that story very carefully. I talked to Hillary about it; I talked to Al and Tipper about it; and I asked myself then-I am still asking myself-what more can we do to deal with some of the unbelievable tragedies that were plainly avoidable, clearly documented in that important article? This is a good beginning, and I hope that Congress will fund it. And finally, it is profoundly significant what we have heard about children. We have to do more to reach out to troubled young people. One out of ten children suffers from some form of mental illness, from mild depression to serious mental disease. But fewer than 20 percent receive proper treatment. One of the most sobering statistics that I have heard in all of this is that a majority of the young people who commit suicide-now the third leading cause of death in teenagers, especially gay teenagers-are profoundly depressed. Yet the majority of parents whose children took their own lives say they did not recognize their children's depression until it was too late. The tragedy at Columbine High School, as Hillary said, was for all of us a wakeup call. We simply cannot afford to wait until tragedy strikes to reach out to troubled young people. Today I am pleased to announce a new national school safety training program for teachers, schools, and communities to help us identify troubled children and provide them better school mental health services. This new program is the result of a remarkable partnership by the National Education Association, EchoStar, and members of the Learning First Alliance, joined by the Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services. This fall the Vice President and Tipper will kick off the first training session, which will be transmitted via satellite to more than 1,000 communities around our Nation. We are all very grateful to EchoStar, a satellite company based in Littleton, Colorado, and its partner, Future View, for helping make this possible by donating satellite dishes to 1,000 school districts, and 40 hours of free time. I want to ask businesses and broadcasters all around our country to follow EchoStar's lead and donate their time, expertise, and equipment to help ensure that every school district in America can participate in this important training program. Now I want to introduce two of the people who are showing this kind of leadership: the president of the NEA, Bob Chase; and Bill Vanderpoel, the vice president of EchoStar. I'd like to ask them to come up and talk a little bit about what they are going to do. Let us give them a big hand. Thank you both very much. Now, I'd like to ask Tipper to come up one more time so we can all tell her how grateful we are, and let me say this. You probably saw a little bit by the way she positioned Al on time and she positioned Hillary on time-I think I am going to start calling her Sarge behind her back. She has driven us all. We have been on time; we have been at the place we were supposed to be; we say what we were supposed to say; we finished on time. So she not only has great sensitivity; she has phenomenal organizing ability, and we are very grateful for her. Thank you. Now, I'd like to ask Hillary and the Vice President to come over, too. Thank you all very much. God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehouseconferencementalhealth", "title": "Remarks at the White House Conference on Mental Health", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-white-house-conference-mental-health", "publication_date": "07-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 1068, "text": "Well, first of all, let me say thank you for the welcome. I thank the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who are here and other Members of Congress and the people from our administration who are here. I want to thank Jimmy Smits and Felix Sanchez. And I want to congratulate your honorees, Sara Martinez Tucker and the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, for 25 years of service. I want to say a special word of appreciation to all the Latinos who have been part of our administration, including Maria Echaveste, Mickey Ibarra, Brian Barretto, Aida Alvarez, Bill Richardson, and all the others. Let me say, I am sorry I am not in proper attire tonight. But Jimmy Smits called me this afternoon, and I only had two other things I was supposed to do, and so he said I had to show. And I want you to know I am here in spite of the fact that Jimmy Smits called me. And I will tell you why. If I have to hear Hillary say one more time, That is the best looking man I have ever seen, I think I will die. So, right before I was here, I went over to the Kennedy Center. And there is a magnificent event at the Kennedy Center that Kerry Kennedy Cuomo is having about her book on human rights activists, and artists from all over our country and human rights heroes from all over the world are over there tonight. And so, I went from there to a book party for my friend Paul Begala. And I am on my way over here, and everybody wanted to know where I was going. And this NBC television reporter said, Jimmy Smits, that is the best looking man I ever saw in my life. So, I said, Well, what can I tell you? I have been to war for 8 years now, and I do not look very good anymore. He will never forgive me for embarrassing him like that. I want to say something seriously. Felix, I appreciate what you have done so much with this foundation. And I want to say, I made fun of Jimmy Smits tonight, but I want you to know that becoming a friend of his has been one of the real joys of being ENTITY. He has been so kind to my wife and to me, to our family. He is been to the White House many times, and he is always been there for a good cause. And I hope you will forgive me for pulling your leg tonight, Jimmy, but I will never forget you for being our friend. Thank you very much. I want to thank the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts for giving young people a chance. From the silver screen to the Broadway stage, kids with talent and dreams need a chance. That is what we have tried to do for 8 years now for all America's children. And the Vice ENTITY and I owe those of you who have done so much to help us do that a profound debt of gratitude, and I thank you. Tonight I came mostly just to do that, just to say thank you, for all you do for the arts, for all you do for the Hispanic community, and for all you have done to help America move forward in the last 8 years. We now have the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate we have ever recorded, the lowest Hispanic poverty rate in a generation, a million new homeowners in the last 6 years. The earned-income tax credit has been doubled, and it is lifted over a million Hispanics out of poverty. The minimum wage helped 1.6 million Hispanic workers, and it is time to raise it again and help more. The Hispanic Education Action Plan to encourage Hispanic youth to stay in school and go to college, along with our scholarship initiatives and other things, have contributed to the fact that the college-going rate among Hispanic young people is up over 50 percent in the last 7 years. And-listen to this-a report which was issued last week said there has been a 500 percent increase in the number of Hispanic students taking advanced placement courses in high school to prepare for college. Under the Vice ENTITY's leadership, we have reduced the naturalization backlog at INS. And under Aida Alvarez's leadership, loans to Hispanic entrepreneurs by the SBA have increased by 250 percent. We have all been enriched by your work. And I know that because of your work, we will have more great singers, more great writers, more great actors and actresses. I know we have got a long way to go, too, because still Latino characters are only about 3 percent of those that appear on prime-time television. I just left Rita Moreno, and I told her that I enjoyed watching her as a nun on her television series. And we were laughing about it. And I think that you will see, if you keep working, though, more and more of our movies and our television shows and our Broadway shows reflecting the rich diversity of America. And that is the last point I want to make. I have said on many occasions, and I will just say one more time tonight, that if I could have only one wish for America, believe it or not, it would not be for a continued unbroken economic prosperity. It would be that somehow we would find the wisdom to live together as brothers and sisters, to truly be one America across all the lines that divide us. And to-just sort of a little picture of how fast America has changed; you may see the advertisements today for-they are on television now-for Denzel Washington's new movie about the integration of T.C. Williams High School over in Alexandria, Virginia, and its football team, which occurred-what-almost 40 years ago, not such a long time ago once you have reached my age, anyway. Now, a little over three decades later, that high school is in a school district which has students from over 180 different racial and ethnic groups, parents speaking over 100 different native languages. It is the most diverse school district in America. And I think it is sort of fitting that this movie, coming out in the new millennium, talks about something that to most of these kids is ancient history, that we hope they will never forget. But it is sobering to look at the profile of them and realize that they are both the great opportunity and the great challenge of the future: Can we figure out a way to give them all a world-class education, with all their diversity? Can we figure out a way to make sure that every single child, every family, every faith in America is profoundly proud of its roots, understands them, and yet believes deep in the core of being that our common humanity is even more important than our unique characteristics? These are very big questions. Not so long ago, a number of you in this room came to the White House for a showing of Mi Familia, the movie. Remember, you saw it; you were there. And so I was thinking about that tonight and feeling sort of nostalgic. And I think the central question that all of us have to ask ourselves, both within and beyond our borders now, is who is in our family anyway? There is an astonishing new book out, been out a few months, by a man named Robert Wright, called Non Zero, kind of a weird title unless you are familiar with game theory. But in game theory, a zero-sum game is one where, in order for one person to win, somebody has to lose. A non-zero-sum game is a game in which you can win, and the person you are playing with can win, as well. And the argument of the book is that, notwithstanding all the terrible things that happened in the 20th century- the abuses of science by the Nazis, the abuses of organization by the Communists, all the things that continue to be done in the name of religious or political purity-essentially, as societies grow more and more connected, and we become more interdependent, one with the other, we are forced to find more and more non-zero-sum solutions. That is, ways in which we can all win. And that is basically the message I have been trying to preach for 8 years here, that everybody counts; everybody deserves a chance; we all do better when we help each other. We have to have an expanding idea of who is in our family. And we in the United States, because we are so blessed, have particular responsibilities to people not only within our borders who have been left behind but beyond our borders who otherwise will never catch up if we do not do our part, because we are all part of the same human family and because, actually, life is more and more a non-zero-sum game, so that the better they do, the better we will do. Now, I believe, because of the history and culture, because of the pain and the promise of the Hispanic community in the United States, you are uniquely qualified to make sure America learns this lesson now. And so that is the last thing I'd like to say from the heart. You have made being ENTITY this last 8 years a joy. It has been an honor for me to work with so many of you. If our country is better off because of anything I did, I am grateful. But all the best stuff is still out there if we can learn to preserve what is special about us and our clan, our tribe, and our faith, and do it while affirming our common humanity. Do that for America, and the best is still out there. Thank you, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalhispanicfoundationforthearts", "title": "Remarks to the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-hispanic-foundation-for-the-arts", "publication_date": "19-09-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 612, "text": "Much has been said by former speakers of the honor I have done this State by coming here. Let me make one thing clear-very clear: no greater honor can come to any individual and citizen of this country than to be received in friendly fashion by a cross-section of his fellow citizens. You have honored me. I think, first, I should like to remember my manners and thank you--each of you--as representatives of my host State for the warm reception I have had, for the beautiful presents given me. As a matter of fact, for the prestige I shall have in Pennsylvania when I can show a cow that has no other like it around there. They will come to see that farm if for no other reason than that cow. Now I had a number of reasons for coming here. I think they can all be summed up in one word: self-education. I do not think I know enough--ever--about the people of the United States, with whom I am privileged to meet and mingle when I go on a trip like this. Particularly, I have been denied too many opportunities to go to the northern three States of the New England group. I have long wanted to come here, and for two years I have carried it as a determination. And finally, I got the permission of Governor Adams to come--and here I am! Now one of the first things I want to learn is where Calvin Coolidge got a certain skill that I have not acquired. He held the same position I now hold. He had a distinguished record, and held it for a long time, and he spoke so rarely that he got the nickname Silent Cal. My own experience in this regard is exemplified by the fact that the day before yesterday I spoke in San Francisco, and here again I am today, still talking. I find that my tongue is clattering in my ears a great deal, and I would like to know what Vermont secret he had that allowed him to avoid this particular responsibility. There is another thing I want to learn; old as I am, there is a lesson in romance I have heard attached to Vermont--told me by that now distinguished citizen, Sherman Adams of New Hampshire. He said there was a Vermont couple that were going to get married, but Mary thought that John ought to save a thousand dollars before they really were married. And they agreed, they thought it was a good thing. And he worked all winter long, and when June again approached, Mary thought it was a nice time to think of marriage, and she said, How much have you saved? Well, John looked a little bit sheepish and did not want to confess, but after a while he said, Thirty-five dollars. She said, That is near enough, John. Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confidence--the emotion--the idealism--that we normally associate with Vermont when we say the word Ethan Allen. By the way, I hear my cow came from Ethan Allen's farm. And am I glad --I think I shall call her Mrs. Ethan Allen. Actually, I came here just to see you--to see people. I want to know you better. There are certain things I do know about you. I know that Americans everywhere are the same, in their longing for peace, a peace that is characterized by justice, by consideration for others, by decency above all, by its insistence on respect for the individual human being as a child of his God. All of us want that. All of us want the institutions of America preserved. It makes no difference what party label you attach to an American, we have equal veneration for our Constitution, for the basic principles that have been so beautifully upheld in this State, so well described in that tribute to the people of this State by Calvin Coolidge, just read to you a little while ago. Those are the things America wants. But what we must find out is: what are the methods by which we approach all of these things? What are the traits we must ourselves display and hold on to? We know we must be determined. We know we must not sacrifice principle for mere expediency. But do we know also that the responsibility is on us to attempt to understand others as we think they should understand us? Do we even make the mistake of assuming that the rest of the world knows us, knows our peaceful intentions, knows that we want nobody else's land, nobody else's rights, that we covet nothing? We merely want to live in peace with all the world, to trade with them, to commune with them, to learn from their cultures, as they may learn from ours. I assure you, my friends, they do not know it. Even nations we know enlightened still have much to learn about America. Indeed, every single citizen of every other State has something to learn about you. It is probably a pity that every citizen of each State cannot visit all the others, to see the differences, to learn what we have in common, and to come back with a richer, fuller understanding of America in all its beauty, in all its dignity, in all its strength, in support of moral principle. I think as we think on these things, in lieu of travel, we do become stronger. As we think of our neighbors, as we try to apply with him or with her the spirit of the Golden Rule, we are doing the same in a very definite sense in our relationships with all the world. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what will strengthen America and in the long run, thoroughly practiced, will help bring peace. We will remain strong always, but always in one hand will be the olive branch held out to all who will take it in honesty and in integrity. That is what I feel about America, in its principles, its basic hopes and aspirations. I come to you, not only to understand you better, but to ask you only to support, always, those principles, to think of them and to expand them in your own mind into method, as to how we shall do it; and then you will always make your own contribution to the peace of the world, so that our sons may stay at home, the products of our toil may be used for our schools and our roads and our churches, and not for guns and planes and tanks and ships of war. And now as I say goodby and go for my first chance to use that beautiful fishing rod--a product of Vermont that was given me a few moments ago I want to say only this, in terms of the greatest sincerity and honesty: if you do think on these things and devise for yourself your ideas of what should be done, if you will communicate those ideas to others, hammer out a common solution on the anvil of debate and argument and discussion, you will be doing your full part in bringing about this age-old dream of mankind: peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

{"id": 905, "text": "Good morning, everybody. By now, our economic crisis is well-known. Our economy is shrinking. Unemployment rolls are growing. Businesses and families cannot get credit, and small businesses cannot secure the loans they need to create jobs and get their products to market. Now is the time for Washington to act with the same sense of urgency that Americans all across the country feel every single day. With the stakes this high, we cannot afford to get trapped in the same old partisan gridlock. That is why I have worked closely with leaders of both parties on a recovery and reinvestment plan that saves or creates more than 3 million jobs over the next 2 years, cuts taxes for 95 percent of American workers, and makes critical investments in our future--in energy and education, health care, and a 21st century infrastructure. We will act swiftly, and we will act wisely. The vast majority of the investments in the plan will be made within the next 18 months, immediately creating jobs and helping States avoid painful tax hikes and cuts to essential services. And every dime of the spending will be made available to the public on recovery.gov, so every American can see where their tax dollars are going. But as we act boldly and swiftly to shore up our financial system and revitalize our economy, we must also make sure that the underpinnings of that economy are sound; that our economic infrastructure is rebuilt to handle the traffic of the global economy; that our cutting-edge science and technology remain the envy of the world; that our policies promote the innovative and competitive nature of this economy and facilitate the incubation and commercialization of our startups and small businesses, the very engine of our job creation. These are the tasks of the Commerce Department. And I believe that Judd Gregg is the right person to help guide the Department towards these goals. Judd discovered the family business at an early age. His father, Hugh Gregg, was elected the youngest Governor of New Hampshire when judge--Judd was a boy. At a time when the mills in Nashua closed down and folks were laid off, he watched his dad work tirelessly to attract new industry, the kind that created jobs that carried with them a sense of dignity and self-worth. Judd's father even found the time to publish a book titled All I Learned About Politics, and in keeping with his legendary sense of humor, all of its pages were blank. When the book is written about Judd Gregg, it will tell the story of a man with his own proud record of service on behalf of the American people. As a businessman, attorney, State executive councilor, Congressman, Governor in his own right, and now as a Senator, he is seen from all angles what makes our economy work for communities, businesses, and families, and what keeps it from working better. As former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Judd has been involved in nearly every facet of public policy. And as Commerce Subcommittee chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, he is already quite familiar with the Department I have chosen him to lead. Judd is famous--or infamous, depending on your perspective--on Capitol Hill for his strict fiscal discipline. It is not that he enjoys saying no, although if it is directed at your bill, you might feel that way. It is that he shares my deep-seated commitment to guaranteeing that our children inherit a future they can afford. Now, clearly, Judd and I do not agree on every issue; most notably who should have won the election. But we agree on the urgent need to get American businesses and families back on their feet. We see eye to eye on conducting the Nation's business in a responsible, transparent, and accountable manner. And we know the only way to solve the great challenges of our time is to put aside stale ideology and petty partisanship and embrace what works. As one of the Republican Party's most respected voices and skillful negotiators, Judd is a master of reaching across the aisle to get things done. He will be an outstanding addition to the depth and experience of my economic team, a trusted voice in my Cabinet, and an able and persuasive ambassador for industry who makes it known to the world that America is open for business. Commerce defies every wind, overrides every tempest, and invades every zone. These are the words carved into the walls of the Department that I am so pleased Judd Gregg has agreed to lead. And as we act boldly to defy the winds of this crisis and outride the tempest of this painful moment, I can think of no finer steward for our Nation's commerce. I expect the Senate's quick confirmation of their esteemed colleague, and I look forward to working with Judd in the years ahead. And I'd like Judd to say just a few words.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenominationsenatorjuddgreggbesecretarycommerce", "title": "Remarks on the Nomination of Senator Judd A.

{"id": 1016, "text": "I think all of you can see before me the results of a tremendous amount of work and cooperation among all those in our Government who are interested in the present and future strength of our Nation's number one economic resource, and that is agriculture. I think it is also accurate to point out that more than has ever been the case in the past, that professional nutritionists and their representatives, private citizens, consumer groups, have been involved in the preparation of this legislation. Another fact that I think would be undisputed is that in the last 40 years, there has never been such a far-reaching and important piece of legislation passed relating to American agriculture. There is been a heavy emphasis in this bill on the strength of the American farm family. This is an important concept for us all. We are very eager to continue our preeminent position in international agricultural trade circles. Public Law 480, which permits us to dispose of American food products in a beneficial way, is enhanced. Foreign trade with the sale of our own agricultural commodities is enhanced. We have in this bill, too, a new approach to the food stamp question. This has sometimes been considered as an anomaly or an anachronism in a modern day Department of Agriculture. But I think this legislation that has been included in the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 is a great step forward in providing a simple food stamp system and one that would be easy to administer, one that is more equitable, which eliminates the pervasive threat of fraud. I'd also like to point out that this bill includes many other features--a renewed emphasis and an enhancement of our research program in agriculture that is so important to every family. It, for the first time, makes a major step toward tying target prices to actual production costs. This has been one of the most controversial issues that the Congress has had to face. Obviously, because production costs vary so widely from one community to another, and a bill of this kind has to deal with average prices or cost of production throughout the country, there still remain and will inevitably remain some inequities. But this bill makes a giant step toward tying target prices with production costs, and it also narrows its focus on individual commodities so that there can be more equity insured. This bill also sets up a means for maintaining adequate food reserves. Although we have been blessed recently with bountiful crops, we do not have an excessive reserve supply of crucial food and feed items on hand. This bill permits us to maintain adequate reserves, and it also encompasses a provision that is very dear to me, and that is that most of the reserves will be under the control of farmers and that there is a very careful safeguard against the dumping of agricultural products on the market, artificially, to force prices down and, therefore, to damage the economy of farm families. We have moved in this bill to correct a very serious economic problem that exists among the farm communities of our Nation by increasing target and loan prices for the 1977 crop. And I believe that this will certainly be a good investment both this year and in the future. Another aspect of this bill that particularly ,appeals to me is the reduction of Government interference in the agricultural economy. This is always devoutly to be sought, and I think the Congress has very wisely achieved this goal in this current legislation. We have eliminated acreage allotments. Quite often in the past, acreage allotments historically have evolved into a financial measure of the benefit of Government programs, and they are bought and traded like actual property. This bill moves to eliminate those acreage allotments. We have also maintained an important element in the set-aside authority for the Agriculture Secretary. And very shortly now, set-aside regulations will be promulgated by this Department. I have to admit that the bill is about $300 million more costly than I had personally preferred to see. But I think the investment is a good one. And I think the cost of this bill, because of its wise drafting, will be less and less as the future years go by. We have an exceptional case at the present time in agriculture, where additional expenditures are required. One of the elements of agricultural legislation and appropriations which is often overlooked is that at least half the costs that are normally attributed to an agricultural bill are actually in the form of redeemable loans. And this is not an expenditure from the Federal Government; it is an investment in a very good and sound commodity. The loan is secured and the loans are repaid, but under our present accounting system, this is identified as an expenditure, and it tends to distort in the public mind the degree of Federal investment in agriculture. I'd like to close by saying that I am very proud of the good work that has been done this year, and in years gone by, by Senator Talmadge, the chairman of the Senate committee and, of course, by Tom Foley and Bob Poage and all those Democrats and Republicans who've worked with them, both within the committee and on the floor of Congress. These have been tedious studies and negotiations. Bob Bergland and his staff in the Department of Agriculture have worked very harmoniously with the congressional leaders. And as ENTITY of our country, as a farmer myself, as someone who feels a direct responsibility to the consumers of this country, I am very proud now to affix my signature onto the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 and ratify into law one of the most progressive and far-reaching pieces of legislation that has come before me.

{"id": 805, "text": "THIS IS a day of some personal sadness for me. I have in my hand the resignation of Luther Hodges who is departing his post as Secretary of Commerce. Secretary Hodges is a distinguished American who has served his State and his Nation and has in his entire lifetime given to the American people the best that is in him always for the benefit of his beloved country. His stewardship of the Commerce Department was both progressive and prudent. I have accepted Secretary Hodges' resignation with deep regret because he is not only a good and wise American but he is. my longtime trusted personal friend. But the American system that produced Luther Hodges has within its gifts the capacity to produce a man to take his place. I have elected to ask the Senate to give their advice and consent to my nomination of John T. Connor of New Jersey to be Secretary of Commerce. I truly believe that John Connor is an authentic example of what the American educational and free enterprise system can create. Until yesterday he was the president of Merck & Company, one of the Nation's leading pharmaceutical firms. He was on the board of directors of General Motors and General Foods, and other leading boards. He is a leader on the Committee for Economic Development and the Business Advisory Council. He is not unacquainted with the ways of Washington. In 1942 he was the General Counsel for the Office of Scientific Research and Development, at that time headed by the distinguished American, Vannevar Bush. In 1945 he became counsel to the new Office of Naval Research, and later special assistant to the late, respected James Forrestal. In between times he served as a rugged Marine and reached the rank of captain. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1936 magna cum laude, and from Harvard Law School in 1939. I might add that he was not backward in his studies. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. John Connor is the kind of man I am proud to have serve in the Cabinet. He is smart and he is loyal and he is patriotic. He will never discard a principle nor despair of doing what is right and ought to be done. I think the credentials that he bears in his heart and in his mind are the kind of credentials that will make his Nation proud and will cause great achievements to be his legacy in the country that he has served so well and in the Nation that he loves. I now present to you Mr. Connor. I have asked the new Secretary of Commerce to meet and work with the Secretary of Labor and the voice of American labor in this country, Mr. George Meany. We have had some preliminary meetings, and I hope to see the relationship between business and labor continue in the years ahead as it has in the months behind us. I know that the distinguished Secretary of Labor, Mr. Wirtz, will be anxious to cooperate, and I expect the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor to work very closely in leading the business community and the labor community to a record of all-time harmony and mutual respect in this country. I thank Mr. Meany for meeting with us this morning, and Secretary Wirtz. I now want to ask Mr. Hodges if he will say a word to you. George Reedy will have available for you Mr. Hodges' letter of resignation and my reply, together with biographical data concerning Mr. Connor. One final statement before we leave. We will try to make this transition effective on January 15th. We will send the nomination to the Senate at an early date. We have completed the necessary details and investigations and they are behind us and we hope that the takeover can be January 15th. Secretary Wirtz, did you want to say something? I have asked Mr. Meany to meet with me and other members of American labor before we leave for the Christmas holidays to discuss our program for the coming years. I have already met with the Economic Council and the Business Council, and I will be conferring from time to time with leading educators, businessmen, and labor men here at the White House, and perhaps at the ranch before the new session.

{"id": 958, "text": "I do not have to tell anyone viewing this program that our country, and in fact the world of facing an unprecedented series of crises. We are dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We are dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact tens of millions of workers in this country. We are dealing with a political crisis as well. And I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering, what is going to happen to me tomorrow in my own city? Burlington, Vermont, laws have been shut down. restaurants shutdown, showcase centers shut down, schools shutdown. What happens to all the people who lose their jobs? What happens to the people who tonight are worried that they may have the coronavirus but do not have the resources to get the tests they need or the treatment that they need. So this is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together. And what I wanted to do tonight along with you is to talk about a series of proposals that we all working on right now and will introduce to the democratic leadership as to how we can best go forward. And in this unprecedented moment this will require an unprecedented amount of money and my own guess is that we will be spending at least $2 trillion in funding to prevent deaths, job losses, and to avoid an economic catastrophe. So let me just go over some of the issues and we will be posting these ideas tomorrow up on our website, berniesanders.com. And this is what I would like because we certainly do not know it all we want to hear from you, not only your ideas about how we can best go forward, talk about your experiences. In every state there is a different level of crisis, in every occupation there is a different level of concern. So please communicate with us so we can get the best understanding possible about what is going on in our country and how together we can come up with some effective remedies. Let me start off with the basics and that is obviously from my perspective and I know from all of your perspectives. We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get the healthcare they need regardless of their income. This is kind of a no-brainer. It is something that should have happened in our country many, many years ago. But in the midst of this crisis, what I believe we must do is empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency. Now, this is not Medicare for all. We cannot pass that right now, but what this does say is that if you are uninsured, if you are under insured, if you have high deductibles, if you have high copayments, if you have out of pocket expenses, Medicare will cover those expenses so that everybody, regardless of their healthcare needs, and I am not just talking about the coronavirus, but their health care needs in the midst of this crisis, will get all the healthcare that they need. That is what we should be doing in this moment of crisis. We need to make sure furthermore, that as we go forward, we are effectively prepared to deal with the healthcare crisis that we are facing and that means that we need to make sure that the hospitals have all of the ICU units and the ventilators that are needed to respond to this crisis. What the fear is as you know, is that there will be a surge of patients coming into the hospitals and that we will not have the equipment that we need to deal with that crisis. Now, in my view, I mean, frankly, it is incomprehensible why in the wealthiest country on earth, we are not better prepared, but be that as it may, in my view right now, the federal government must work aggressively with the private sector to make certain that this equipment is available to hospitals and the rest of the medical community. In other words, federal government must take the responsibility of working with the private sector and saying, you know what, this is a major priority. You are going to get the job done. And during this crisis, in addition, of course, we need to mobilize medical residents, people in medical school, retired medical professionals and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis. One of the great fears that we are facing right now is that doctors themselves and nurses themselves will become ill. And if our frontline defense in the medical profession is injured, is made sick, is not able to treat the American people, that is only going to make a very difficult situation even worse. Furthermore, and again, this goes without saying, it is something that should have been done, It has to be done immediately. We must massively increase the availability of test kits, test kits for coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We must look to successful coronavirus testing models in other countries and throughout our own country and implement best practices here. And right now there are communities and states all over this country that do not have the test kits. It is taking too long to get the results. We have got to aggressively address that. In my view, we need to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our healthcare workers need. It is again, quite unbelievable, but we have a short supply of masks, and if the doctors and nurses do not have the masks that they need, it is going to be very difficult for them to provide the care that patients require. We need to utilize the national guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to deal with this crisis. Today our armed forces must be immediately activated to build mobile hospitals and testing facilities, assist providers reopen hospitals that have been shut down and expand our healthcare capacity in underserved areas. One of the ongoing crisis is that our healthcare system faces in many parts of this country under the best of times, people cannot find a doctor or a hospital 200 miles away from them. That is not acceptable and we have to address that reality in the midst of this crisis today. We need to dramatically expand community health centers, which provide primary care, dental care and mental health care, as well as low cost prescription drugs to nearly 30 million Americans, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable. We have a primary healthcare system which is in very, very bad shape. Even people who have insurance having a hard time in many cases finding the doctors that they need. So expanding community health centers will be a significant step forward in making sure that there are locations where people can get the testing they need, get the treatment that they need, get the healthcare that they need in general. And while we are making sure that all of our people have the healthcare that they need, we must also respond to the growing economic crisis that this pandemic is causing. That means that we must make sure that everyone who has a job right now receives the paychecks that they need and does not lose their income. As we speak right now, think about the millions of workers who are being laid off in the tourism industry, in the fast food industry, in the restaurant industry, in the transportation industry. These are folks who do not have a lot of money as all of you know, some 40% of the people in this country cannot afford a $400 emergency. So people are sitting out there and they are saying, My God, what am I going to do? How do I take care of my families? And that has got, got to be the major, major economic priority that we address. How do we take care of the working families of this country who are negatively impacted by this crisis? Small and medium size businesses, especially those in severely impacted industries such as restaurants, bars, and local retail need immediate relief. We must tell these businesses who are being forced to lay off, in some cases their entire staff or possibly even shut down through no fault of their own, that we will not allow them to go out of business. The federal government will work with affected businesses to provide direct payroll costs for small and medium-sized businesses to keep workers employed until this crisis has passed. In other words, bottom line here, most important point is workers need to continue to get a paycheck even when their businesses are shut down. Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families. Now we are throwing out a lot of ideas and when you deal with the United States Congress, you do not get everything that you want. There will be picking and choosing here and there, but I think it is important for us tonight to discuss the various options that they have. And one of those options is to make sure that people at least getting $2,000 a month check to take care of their basic needs. And importantly, we must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible. In other words, we do not want some kind of bureaucratic arrangement. We were talking about this for weeks and months and people do not get the help that they need. We must provide emergency unemployment assistance to anyone who loses their job through no fault of their own. Under the proposal that I am working on, everyone who loses a job must qualify for unemployment compensation at 100% of their prior salary with a cap of $75,000 a year. In addition, those who depend on tips, waiters and waitresses and others, gig workers, domestic workers, freelancers, and independent contractors must also qualify for unemployment insurance to make up for the income that they lose during this crisis. I think as many of you know, unemployment compensation does not cover every worker in America. There are millions of people exempt from unemployment. We have got to deal with that right now. It does not matter what work you are doing. If you lose your job, you need unemployment. Further, we need to make certain that seem as people with disabilities and families with children have access to decent quality food. That means expanding the Meals on Wheels program, the school meals program and food stamps so that no one goes hungry during this crisis and everyone who cannot leave that home can receive nutritious meals delivered directly to where they live. In other words, that is as basic as you can get in America during this crisis, people must not go hungry. We must place an immediate moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and utility shutoffs and suspend payment on mortgage loans for primary residences and utility bills. In other words, it would be unacceptable that people could lose their homes, lose their apartments, see electricity or gas shutoffs during this crisis, so they must be a moratorium in those areas. Furthermore, we must restore utility services to any customers who have had the utilities shut off. Unbelievably in America right now, you have got a whole lot of folks who literally do not have running water in their homes because they have not been able to pay their water bill, they may not have electricity and that has got to be dealt with right now. We must also provide funding for states and localities to provide rental assistance for the duration of this crisis. In addition, we need to waive all student loan payments for the duration of the emergency. Longterm as I think all of you know, it is my view that we must cancel all student debt and make public colleges and universities and trade schools tuition free, and that is the view that I have held for a long time. But right now at the very least, we must make sure that nobody is obliged to pay their student loan right now. Furthermore, we must ensure that the homeless survivors of domestic violence and college students quarantined off campus are able to receive the shelter, the healthcare, and the nutrition they need and connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. We must also utilize empty hotel beds and other vacant properties to ensure that everyone in this country is safely housed during this crisis. We cannot forget that right now, tonight, there are some 500,000 people who are homeless, some in emergency shelters, some who are sleeping out on the street. Our job is to make sure that everyone is safely housed during this crisis. Further, we must protect farmers by suspending all farm service agency loan payments to protect farmers during this crisis, extend crop insurance and emergency loans to all affected farmers, extend rural development loans, and expand the emergency food assistance program to help alleviate hunger throughout the country and support our farmers during this crisis. We already have a major, major crisis in terms of family-based agriculture in America. Thousands and thousands of family farmers are losing their farms, we have got to stop that process right now during this emergency. Finally, we must make sure that our response to this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street. Let me underline that. We must make certain that this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street. We need to establish an oversight agency to ensure that no one is profiting off of the economic pain and suffering of our people in the midst of this crisis. Any emergency credit extensions or loans to insolvent companies or industries as a result of this crisis must come with strict protections and benefits for workers, for unions and for customers not no strings attached handouts for large corporations and their executives. During this crisis, we will ban stock buy backs and bonuses for executives. We will put conditions on this financial assistance to make certain that any corporation in America that benefits from emergency aid does not lay off workers, pays workers a livable wage and does not rip off consumers. We must make sure that companies they get bailouts are required to sell equity to the government and put workers on their board of directors. We need to prevent price gouging by pharmaceutical companies. As soon as coronavirus vaccine is developed, it must be sold for free. This is not an opportunity for some drug companies to make a fortune by charging an outrageous price for the medicine that people need in order to stay alive. Further all prescription drugs that are developed with taxpayer dollars must be sold at a reasonable price. The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost. This is not the time for profiteering or price gouging. So we have covered a lot of territory tonight and this is what I would very much appreciate where I'd appreciate getting your help. Once again, this is an outline of proposals that I will be introducing to the Senate leadership and working with the Democratic leadership to implement. But it is important for me to hear your comments. We will have this outline up tomorrow in a little bit clearer way on our website, berniesanders.com. And in addition to that we need to know what you are experiencing right now. It is hard to write proper legislation if we are not familiar with the kinds of pain and problems that people all across this country are facing. So let me just conclude by once again thanking all of you for being with us tonight to understand that what this country is experiencing right now is something that we have never experienced in the modern history of this country. That is, number one, a major pandemic, which threatens the health and lives of millions of our people. And on top of that, an economic crisis which threatens the jobs and the income of many, many, many millions of people. So we got some major crises, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future. This is the richest country in the history of the world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources, we can do it. We can address this crisis. We can minimize the pain and let us do just that. So let us go forward together and I look forward to continuing to communicate with you, to tell you where we are coming from, what our ideas are, and look forward to hearing from you as to what your ideas are and what your situation is. So once again, thank you very much for joining us this evening. Good night.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsberniesanderscoronavirusspeechtranscriptonprimarynightmarch17", "title": "Bernie Sanders Coronavirus Speech Transcript on Primary Night March 17", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/bernie-sanders-coronavirus-speech-transcript-on-primary-night-march-17", "publication_date": "17-03-2020", "crawling_date": "03-07-2023", "politician": ["Bernie Sanders"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1069, "text": "Thank you, Josh Smith, and all of you. Thank you very much, Josh, and thank all of you. My heavens, 27 different States, I am told, represented here by all of you. Josh, I cannot begin to thank you, not only for your friendship and loyal support but your service to the Government, to the people, I would put it that way, and also for your outstanding commitment to small business and your own accomplishments in that field. I also want to acknowledge Josh's wife, Jackie Jones-Smith, who is the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission; my old friend Milton Bins here, chairman of the Council of 100. Kay James from the Office of National Drug Control Policy gave up an awful lot to move over there to fight this drug scourge, and I am very proud of her. Reverend Thad Garrett, we all know Thad. He ought to be praying more and talking less out there on the campaign -- -- I need that, I will tell you. But somebody once gave me a little rug, and it said, What would we do without friends? I am grateful that Thad and so many others out here are true and loyal friends. When the going is tough, they are hanging in there. I want to salute Fred Brown, the chairman of the National Council of Black Republicans. I was very grateful to Reverend Larry Haygood for that invocation, for his leadership in education, for his commitment and faith. Thank you, sir, for coming and for doing that. Of course, I cannot say too much about Lou Sullivan. I love it when we talk about genuine health care reform for this country. He summarized it in his remarks there, giving me the credit. But he is out there on the cutting edge. When a paper like the New York Times, which has not been overly friendly to me this year -- -- points out that we have got a sound, or the best of the health care reform programs out there, why, I am very grateful to Lou. He is tireless in taking the message across the country, and he is leading this, the largest Government bureau, with such distinction and honor. I tell you, we are lucky to have him in the Government. Ginger is not clapping too hard. Maybe she wants him back; I do not know. But nevertheless. May I salute Gary Franks, distinguished Member of Congress. I do not see him, but I know he is here. Where is Gary? Well, he is not here. All right, he is late. He is to be here; Andy Ireland, a Member of the United States Congress, with us here today, too. I want to single out a warrior. Some of you know her just by seeing her on television. Some of you know her for seeing her at my side as I climb on the helicopter or Air Force One or go to take on some political debate. And I am talking about Marlin's able deputy, Judy Smith, who is standing right over here. Judy, I do not want this to come out wrong, but you talk about tough women. I mean, she is strong, and in a wonderful way. She takes it and can dish it out just as well. It is tough out there in that press arena. But boy, she is doing a superb job for me and I think for the country because she gets out our position on fundamental issues that are important to the Nation. Let me just talk for a few minutes. I am off to Wisconsin in a few minutes and then to New Jersey. So I want to just talk a little bit about the concerns that we share about the future of this great country, about the choice that we have in shaping that future. I will spare you a stemwinding political oration, but I will just point out that we have got a great task before us, and the differences are clear. With the end of the cold war that Reverend Haygood very generously referred to, now we have got to turn our attention to winning the new global economic competition. The other side is telling us everything that is wrong about the economy, and I will accept my share of the blame. But we are caught up in something worldwide. And any fair-minded observer knows that it is not just the United States that is had difficult economic times. It is England. It is France. It is Canada. It is Germany now. A lot of countries in this, and we have the strongest economy of all of them. It is my objective to make it even stronger. I call that winning the peace, for only then will we keep the promise of opportunity that is the birthright of every American. I am proud of the fact that our kids go to bed at night without that same fear of nuclear weapons that their predecessors had. This is, I think, a significant accomplishment, and I salute everyone in our administration that worked to help end that nuclear nightmare. But now we have got to do the same thing, apply that same leadership, and lift this country up. You know, the Governor, Governor Clinton, and I offer very different choices. They are really based on very different philosophies, different experience. He is spent most of his life in government. He believes that government, kind of a Washington elite, should take the lead in shaping the economy. He uses the word investing : investing your money, that is taxpayers' money, more wisely than you can as entrepreneurs and individuals. Well, that is not the way I see it at all. Like so many of you, I have spent exactly 50 percent of my adult life in business and 50 percent in government. Not with the sparkling success that some in this room have had as business people, but nevertheless, I understand it. I built a business from the ground up. I met a payroll, created jobs, and worked for a living. I happen to think that that is a good qualification for being ENTITY of the United States, because I believe it is a prospering small business or large business environment that is going to do more to help people. Put it this way, a job in the private sector is going to do more to help people than Government programs can. I learned in that private sector what many of you not only have learned but have mastered: what makes an economy grow. It is not central planning, quote, investing, unquote, the taxpayers' money. It is not the people who take your taxes and spend them. It is you who make the economy grow, ordinary men and women with the extraordinary dreams who have the grit to make those dreams real. And I am very grateful to what Josh does in taking this message of small business out around this country. That understanding is really at the heart of what Larry Haygood again referred to as the Agenda for American Renewal. I talk about the global economy and then what we are going to do now to be the lead. We are the only remaining military superpower. We have the strongest economy; I want to help make it stronger. I want to see us become an export superpower as well. To do this, we have got to unleash the energy, the brainpower of our workers and our entrepreneurs, and again, particularly in small business because this is the area that employs the most and takes the risks and creates the new opportunities. I want to encourage investment so that wages rise and those unemployment lines shrink. That is why I am helping small business in particular and, hopefully, all business in general. We unveiled a good small business program the other day down in North Carolina. I will just touch on a couple of points: Reducing the corporate tax rate for small business 15 percent to 10 percent; increasing the amount of equipment that small business can expense, and thus that would create more jobs and new opportunities; simplifying the tax filing. Most small-business people know that the onerous reporting for tax purposes takes too many work hours, too many people hours, and we are trying to change that. Then, of course, I still feel that to stimulate risk-taking, the reduction in the capital gains is very, very important, bringing people into the enterprise zones in the minority areas; a reduction in capital gains, a break on that will help attract jobs to the areas that need it the very most. So to the business people here, we are trying to streamline so you will not have to be second-guessed back here in Washington by some bureaucratic establishment. And that is why we have put an end to the Federal regulations that turn redtape into pink slips. We just put out a moratorium on them. We are going to go forward with safety and health; obviously we have to do that. But we have got a moratorium, a blanket on new regulations, recognizing that there is too much control and regulation on the back of the small entrepreneur and the small-business person. We really do want to do what Lou was talking about, and that is to make health insurance available to everyone. We want to make health care more accessible and more affordable for everyone. That is why we are all -- have our shoulders to the wheel, fighting for health care reform without burdening small businesses with expensive new mandates and more payroll taxes. Our program is good. It keeps the quality of American health care where it belongs, number one in the entire world, and still says to those who cannot get insurance, we are going to make it available to you through pooling, and also we are going to reduce the costs. We are doing something about these crazy malpractice suits and also doing something about lifting the regulatory burden and streamlining the operating processes of our health care system. So we have got a good program there, and I hope that it'll get the kind of support in the very next Congress that we need to have it enacted into law. I want to reward the risktakers who bring capital and jobs to our inner cities; I touched on that. But it is very interesting to me that when we went to Los Angeles in the wake of the South Central problems, all the civic leaders there were saying we must have enterprise zones. It is an idea whose time has come. We ought to try it at the Federal level. So we are fighting hard to bring the enterprise zones into reality. On issue after issue, you see the very sharp differences between my opponent and me, because he really does want a Government. He is already proposed more taxes, more spending, more regulations. He is already proposed programs that would result in the latter, in the last item, and tax plans and spending plans that would tax at the outset $150 billion more in taxes and $220 billion more in spending. It is going to kill off a lot of small business. So we want to free up, instead, the genius of American enterprise and initiative. This is going to be one of the clearest distinctions as people begin to really make up their minds on this election. Let me be clear: I am not anti-Government. Government must never shirk its responsibilities. The fine men and women honored here today who I have been proud to have at my side for the past 3 years are a testament to the good work that Government can do. We believe it is Government's role to create opportunity, though, and not stifle it, and to clear the path for individual accomplishment, not to block it; to facilitate, not to dictate. Together, we believe that there is no room in our country, and I want to repeat this here, for discrimination of any kind whatsoever. As long as I am ENTITY, I am going to do absolutely everything I can in my power to drive bigotry and anti-Semitism and racism from our great land. You know, I hope you know that I have strong feelings about this. Lou and Josh and I were talking. I am not sure the American people know how strongly I feel about this. That is one of the reasons I hope we get these debates on. We have proposed four debates with the Governor. Let him step up now and debate. We have accepted his formula for two of them, and so, we will have an opportunity there without any filters, without any Monday morning quarterbacks telling you what you thought you heard, to take the case directly to the American people. I have tried in my public life -- like supporting fair housing when I was a Member of Congress from Texas and fighting for I think decent civil rights legislation, whether it is the ADA bill or an antidiscriminatory civil rights bill. I think we got, and others here have mentioned this very generously, an excellent record of appointing officials on the content of their character and their competence to positions of high authority in the Government. I am proud of what both Josh and Lou talked about, to have appointed a higher percentage of blacks and women in the history of the Presidency to important positions. Some are here with us today: Gwen King at the Social Security Commission, who is now going on to new pursuits. I mentioned Kay James, who served with such distinction in several capacities. Some are nonpolitical. I think it is a wonderful thing that Colin Powell is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I do not know anything about his politics, and I could not care less. I know something about his character, though. I know something about his ability, though. I know something of how it is when he is making tough, tough decisions regarding the life of somebody else's son and daughter, and that is all I need to know in selecting the best Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Connie Newman, we all know her, how she served with great distinction in this administration; and a most beloved figure, Joyce Berry. I mentioned Lou, of course. I mentioned Josh for the Commission. But we have got others, Carla Hills, Antonia Novello, Lynn Martin, Bernadine Healy, all women in high-level positions. I am proud of Wayne Budd over at Justice. You talk abut a tough assignment, there is a decent man and a man of honor, fulfilling an extraordinarily tough assignment over at the Department of Justice. My old friend Art Fletcher is head of the Commission. Let me tell you something: I am not going to let the political diatribes going on out there and attacks coming out of some radical groups diminish the pride I take in having appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. So let others try to smear a decent man. I am standing with him. He is going to be a great Justice. You watch. You just wait. He is just beginning. He is going to be outstanding. So we are here to salute all of you -- I came over to do that -- and to thank you, those in Government, for serving and serving with integrity. I will tell you something: Our administration has been a clean administration. You look back over your shoulders. We have not had scandals because we have honorable men and women who sacrifice to serve their country. I am proud of each and every one of you. And in terms of those others who are out in the private sector employing people, creating opportunity, living the American dream, I salute you as well. We want to facilitate what you are doing, not get Government in the way and make it tougher. So this is the message we will be taking to the American people, and I believe we are going to get this job done. It has not been a very pleasant political year for Barbara Bush and me; I will have to confess that. Indeed, I have been around the political track for a long time, and I have never seen quite the anger and the ugliness in the political process, the willingness to twist and distort and make things ugly. But it is worth it; you know it. It is worth it because we have accomplished a lot for this country. We have accomplished a lot on the world scene as well. Now I want to finish the job, finish the job by bringing opportunity and hope to all Americans, and I am very grateful to each and every one of you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalsalutethepresidentandhisblackappointees", "title": "Remarks at the National Salute to the President and His Black Appointees", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-salute-the-president-and-his-black-appointees", "publication_date": "30-09-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 776, "text": "Members of the Congress, Secretary Ray Donovan, our distinguished guests sharing the platform with me, and you ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to the White House. I am delighted to help kick off this 1984 summer youth employment program. And I want to congratulate all the Presidential Certificate Award winners for their dedication to the career development of America's youth and for their generous support of the 1983 private sector jobs program. It is times like this that remind us America was built by people helping people. We are proud to honor you this morning. And I hope that next year your numbers will grow. Would not it be great if we had to hold this out on the South Lawn could not get it in the Rose Garden anymore. Many of you will recall that last July we held a similar ceremony right here in the Rose Garden. And since then, more than 3 million Americans have found jobs. In fact, since the economic expansion began 17 months ago, 5.4 million Americans have found jobs, and the unemployment rate has shown the sharpest drop or the steepest drop in 30 years. Now, that is why when I am asked to describe our economic program I do it with three words jobs, jobs, jobs. But we cannot rest until everyone who wants one and needs one has one. We must and will go forward to keep opportunities expanding, particularly for the young people of America. No single sector of our nation-government, business, labor, or nonprofit organization-can solve the unemployment problem, the needs of our young people. But by working together, pooling our resources and building on our strengths, we can accomplish great things. That is the whole idea behind our youth employment programs' public-private partnerships-to produce real, not make-work, jobs. Partnerships take advantage of opportunities to help America's youth gain a foothold on the economic ladder. Young people who want to work in the summer deserve the chance, and partnerships can make it happen. The summer youth employment program includes a $725 million block grant to State and local governments. This grant will give 718,000 young Americans valuable work experience, but it is only part of our effort to help deserving young people get a start. Another program in place gives employers who hire economically disadvantaged teenagers a tax credit of up to 85 percent of the wages paid. The employers get a young employee the company may not be able to afford without the tax break, and the young worker gets a needed job and valuable work experience in the private sector. Mr. Austin Cunningham of Orangeburg, South Carolina, who is with us today, can tell you how well the targeted jobs tax credit program works. After he discovered the program, Mr. Cunningham promoted the idea to 77 other small business men and women in Orangeburg. Together, they hired 264 economically disadvantaged young people. For most of these 16- and 17- year-olds it was their first real job. And when the summer was over, many of them were asked to stay on full-time even though the tax credit no longer applied. Now, that is partnership in action, and everybody's better off because of it. What we are trying to do is help our young people find that critical first job. With experience in the workplace, America's youth can develop skills and demonstrate their qualifications and potential-permanent employers. But far too often, inexperienced and disadvantaged young people are priced out of the labor market by the minimum wage. Well, Ray Donovan and a lot of other people here today have put together legislation that will give a much-needed boost to those looking for that first job. Today I will submit our youth employment opportunity wage act to the Congress. And Senators Percy and Hatch and Congressman Packard, who have worked hard on this bill, will introduce it on the Hill in behalf of the administration and the American people. This legislation would allow employers to hire young people at a lower minimum wage during the summer months. The bill would increase summer employment opportunities and provide explicit safeguards to protect permanent employees and sanctions to prevent abuse. Now, I am delighted that the National Conference of Black Mayors has endorsed the concept of the youth employment opportunity wage. And now that Mayor Johnny Ford, the past president, and Mayor Marion Barry, the current president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, have endorsed this legislation, maybe we can help Chuck, Orrin, and Ron get this important jobs initiative approved by the Congress. While I have the chance, I want to thank Bill Kolberg and all the other executives of the National Alliance of Business for their continuing support in coordinating the summer jobs program. The White House Office of Private Sector Initiatives and the NAB have done an outstanding job in leading this year's effort. And thanks to the support of other business, community, and State and local agencies, we are reaching out and responding to the needs of our young people. Councils like the Greater Kansas City Alliance of Business are using innovative ideas and modern marketing techniques to develop thousands of summer jobs. Companies like Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, Chevron, the American Council of Life Insurance have donated generously to meet the challenge. Television stations like WTVJ in Miami, KPIX in San Francisco, have held job-athons. WPIX-TV is leading a very successful summer jobs program for New York City. Small business men and women all across America are opening their hearts and their business doors to American youth. And thousands of caring Americans, like Roosevelt Grier and Dave Winfield, who hit a two-run homer in the 10th last night- -are with us today pitching in to help make this year's program the best ever. Yes, America is reaching out with a gift of opportunity, and that is a gift that'll last a lifetime. But there are still far too many young people, particularly disadvantaged and minority youth, who cannot find summer employment. We can and must help them get the chance they so richly deserve. Let me close by asking America's business men and women two questions. Do you remember your first job? Do you remember the lucky break you received even though you were inexperienced and the only skills you had were enthusiasm and determination? I can remember mine. I was 14. It was summer, and there I was with a pick and shovel. And you do learn things, not only about using that pick and shovel. I remember one day, all morning, I'd been swinging that pick. And I had it up for another swing when the noon whistle blew. And I just felt, That is it, and I just let go and stepped out from under it and let it fall behind me. And then I heard some very strong language immediately to my rear. And I turned around, and the boss was standing there, and the pick was embedded in the ground right between his feet. And I learned, if you get that thing up there, swing it. Well, it is your turn now to offer the same opportunity, and you will never regret it. And thank you, and God bless you all for being here. And I was not acting at all. But then there were some who said that I was not before.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswhitehouseceremonymarkingthebeginningthesummeryouthemploymentprogram", "title": "Remarks at a White House Ceremony Marking the Beginning of the Summer Youth Employment Program", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-white-house-ceremony-marking-the-beginning-the-summer-youth-employment-program", "publication_date": "17-05-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 809, "text": "Mr. President, Mrs. Park, all of the distinguished guests in this very distinguished audience tonight. As I am sure most of you realize, this is an historic occasion not only because of the visit that the President of the Republic of Korea is paying to the United States in an official capacity--because this is the first time in this administration and probably in any administration that a state dinner is being given by the President of the United States for the head of the government of another State, in this case the Republic of Korea, and I am honored that it is in my own State of California and here in the great city of San Francisco. We have tried to create to an extent the atmosphere which you would find in the White House. The President was pointing out that when he was at the White House at a state dinner there that the audience was not as large, because only 110 could be seated at a White House state dinner. The wines are from California, the record will show. The flowers are from California, and much of the audience is from California. But the Marine Orchestra, which for 100 years has been the President's orchestra in the White House, was brought from Washington, and the Strolling Strings from the Army came from Washington. We brought them here because we want you to hear them, because one of mine and my wife's most pleasant memories and fondest memories of Korea was in the year 1953 when we became acquainted with the great love of music of the Korean people. Tonight, in attempting to bring to those in this audience who come from California and all over the Nation something of the feeling of Korea that I have and that l believe the people of the United States do have and should have so they will know the facts, I would like to speak, not simply in my capacity as head of state and head of government, officially welcoming another head of state and head of government, whose friendship we value, but I would like to speak from the hearts of all of the American people to the people of Korea. And I would like to tell this audience what Korea means, what it means to me, what I think it means to America and to the world. Korea, first, is a land much like California, a thousand miles of mountains and rivers and valleys. Korea is a land which is very varied in its climate, and in its physical conditions. Korea, to many in the United States, means a war, a war that was difficult, a war that cost casualties, a war that was controversial. But we should think of Korea tonight in a different sense, because as President Park has often reminded us each time he comes to the United States, he speaks of a different Korea. Korea today should mean to America and to the world these things: One, it means courage. In all of the world, and I have been to most of the countries of the world, there are no people more courageous than the people of Korea. They proved their courage fighting for their own freedom in a war that ended 16 years ago. They are proving it by fighting alongside the persons of the United States and those of South Vietnam and other countries in the war in Vietnam with 50,000 Koreans there. And they prove it by maintaining one of the largest armed forces in the world in order to meet the threat which is posed against them in the north. And this kind of courage Americans admire. Korea means courage, therefore, to us. Korea also means friendship and alliance in the deepest sense, not the friendship and alliance simply of words, but the friendship and alliance which goes beyond that, and which involves cooperation not just in a war in Vietnam, but in building the new collective arrangements in Asia, which are so important to peace in the Pacific. And as all of the people in this audience, particularly from California, will realize. peace in the Pacific is essential if we are going to have peace in the world. Because we must remember that the wars that we have been engaged in in the last quarter of a century on three occasions came from the Pacific. But, finally, Korea today means something else that we need to be reminded of. It means self-reliance. It means self-respect. It means independence. You see it in the faces of the Korean people when you go to that country. You see it in the faces of that wonderful children's choir, the orphans' choir, when they come to America and sing so beautifully that the tears come to your eyes when you think of what they have been through, and yet how happy they can be despite all that. And you see it when you realize, as I realized on every occasion today, that Korea is a country which has received aid from the United States, but a country that wants to develop the ability to stand on its own feet. On occasion after occasion, the President and Mrs. Park have expressed the appreciation of the Korean people for the aid they have received from the United States. And my answer is this: We have aided over 100 countries over the last 25 years. Some of those programs have been successes. More of them have been failures. But there is one great lesson. All of the aid in the world will not help the people who are unable or unwilling to help themselves. And the people of Korea are not only willing to help themselves, they insist on helping themselves. And despite their immense military budget, they are developing economically in a remarkably effective way so that the time is now nearing when they will proudly be able to stand on their own two feet economically without any assistance from the United States or any other nation. So these qualities are what we think of or I think of when I think of Korea: courage, true friendship and alliance, and self-reliance, self-reliance which is so important for the character of a great people. In proposing a toast to the President of Korea, I have been reminded that there is a saying in Korea which goes like this: The times in which we live are most trying, but may the time come when peace and prosperity will finally come to those thousand miles of mountains and rivers on which we live. That is what we feel about Korea tonight. We want peace and prosperity for Korea, for all the nations of the world; and, so, from our hearts, I know all will want to join me tonight in raising our glasses to that peace and prosperity for the people of Korea and to the President of Korea and to Mrs. Park--to the President.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandpresidentparkstatedinnersanfrancisco", "title": "Toasts of the President and President Park at a State Dinner in San Francisco", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-president-park-state-dinner-san-francisco", "publication_date": "21-08-1969", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 938, "text": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission - to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands - everywhere - we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House - a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. I think they like you, Steve. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath -- yes. Yes. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including -- including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. It is something I am very proud of. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in value in just this short period of time. The great news -- the great news for Americans' 401, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month - a lot more. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven. We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income. Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. Good feeling. One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Corey, please stand. And he is a great welder. I was told that by the man that owns that company that is doing so well. So congratulations, Corey. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses - many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it is getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago. This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you have been, or where you have come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything. Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, In God We Trust. And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a job well done. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special - that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you have done, Preston. Thank you very much. Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem. Americans love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that is what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So, tonight, I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that is what is happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States - something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama - a big one. And we have not seen this in a long time. It is all coming back. Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They are coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That is where they want to be. Exciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it is very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch. America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our nation has lost its wealth, but we are getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal. We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they will be good ones, but they will be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules. As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Is not it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and let us invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters - Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens - were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th Birthday - such a happy time it should have been - neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you. While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents - these are great people; these are great, great people - that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again. The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by DJ and CJ. He said, Call me either one. So we will call you CJ. Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ's murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done - we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate you, CJ. You are a brave guy. Thank you very much. And I asked CJ, What is the secret? He said, We are just tougher than they are. And I like that answer. Now let us get Congress to send you - and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice. CJ, we are going to send you reinforcements, and we are going to send them to you quickly. It is what you need. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have. Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period. The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release. The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America. In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses - 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do - in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail. As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Thank you, Ryan. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: You will do it, because you can. He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca. As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense. For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly. Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery. Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a V for valor. Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield - including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released. So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you -- to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay. At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid. That is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America. As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies. Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia - and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return. Otto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American resolve. Thank you. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians. He had - and he resolved, after that, to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a new leg. But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world. That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia. And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol - this living monument - this is the moment to the American people. We are a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way. They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again. As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free. Thank you. And God bless America.

{"id": 1067, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen: Woodrow Wilson once said that the Office of President requires the constitution of an athlete, the patience of a mother, and the endurance of an early Christian. Personally, I think he may have overstated the requirements of the Presidency. But from very long and close observation of 34 years, it seems to me that President Wilson may have been describing the requirements for congressional page. So, whether your experience on the Hill has been long or brief, each of you in this page class this morning has been through a very rigorous and a very demanding test. And I want you to know--each of you to know--that I am extremely proud of you. From this point on you will turn upward along many different paths. All of you are exceptional young men with exceptional training. I am sure that in your choices of professions or other pursuits many of you will achieve exceptional success. Whatever your pursuit, however, I hope that the experience you have had at the heart of our representative democratic system will always be a part of your life. Even if you do not choose a career of public service, I hope as private citizens you will live your lives with a high and an active sense of public duty and responsibility. This is a time of change in America. All of us are awakening to the fact that America today is far different from the land into which my generation or your generation was born. The answers, the attitudes, and the approaches of 30 years ago, or 20 years ago, or even 5 years ago, are not now adequate to meet the new obligations or the new opportunities of the 1960's. As one who shares with you a very abiding respect and affection for the Congress, I am especially gratified and pleased by the response that Congress itself has made last year and this year toward meeting the change of our changing times. Congress has done much to silence the critics and the cynics who have belabored it and who have attempted to downgrade it. You can all be proud that you served during a season when the Congress of the United States was strengthened and revitalized as a functioning, responsive, and conscientiously responsible branch of our system of government. And I am pleased that at their own direction they are now engaging in a considerable amount of introspection and study on how they can make the Congress stronger and better and more effective. As this is a changing land, so America stands as a part of the changing world. There are some who would have mankind believe that the only choices of these times are choices between political philosophies. Actually, I do not believe that this is the case. In a real sense, the choice facing men in every nation today, old or young, large and small, is a choice between moving into the modern world with all of its unlimited potential or turning back toward the restrictive world that is dominated by the dogma and the doctrine of the 19th century. So, in your lifetimes, and in the lifetimes of a majority of the nations on earth, the total of human knowledge has doubled twice. The growth of human knowledge has made obsolete many of the causes of friction and contention and division among nations. Certainly the advance of human knowledge has made war itself obsolete and impossible as a means of resolving differences between large or small nations. Above all, the growth of human knowledge has rendered obsolete and archaic the doctrine on which the dogma of communism was constructed. Man today has in his capacity the potential of ending human misery or ending human life. We can really, for the first time, see the promise and the prospect of eliminating hunger and poverty, illness, bias, and prejudice in our own land and, we would hope, all around the world. So, this is the work that we want to do. And this is the work which your generation will do. And that is why I have said over, and over, and over again that we of the United States invite all peoples--East and West--to pull back their curtains, and to tear down their walls, and to come out of the darkness of dogma and walk all together in the bright light of human knowledge and human freedom toward the peace that mankind must make together, and must keep together, on this earth. I have seen many classes of Capitol pages graduate throughout the years. I would say that the class of which you are members faces the brightest and the most thrilling and the most hopeful prospects of any. For never before have young men like yourselves had so sure and so strong a prospect of being a part of the constructive building of a sane and a sensible and a rational world. Whatever profession you choose as your own, I hope you will never forget that the ultimate success of our system rests upon the contributions that every citizen makes to public service. And I would hope that as the days and weeks go by that you would, too, engage in a little introspection and ask yourselves, upon occasions at least: What did I do today to make my country better, to make it stronger, to make my Government more efficient and more useful? And whether as the elected or the elector you will have a great opportunity to be leaders of your times in fostering the responsible and the responsive politics that is needed at every level--local and State, as well as national and international ? You have been privileged to know some of the great leaders of these times in the legislative halls. And I hope that when your time comes you will keep faith by being leaders then in the cause of peace and freedom for the world, and for progress for all of humankind. I went to sleep last night after reading a letter from a mother who was the mother of only one child, and that boy was now 20 years of age. And she had just gotten a letter from him and he said in 20 days he would be on his way to Viet-Nam. And she said, Mr. , I hesitate to take your time to write this letter, but I did not want to see my boy go away unless and until I could have your assurance that our Government and our country needs that boy and needs him where he is going. He had lost his father. He was an only child. It was a difficult letter to dictate an answer to, but I had to write it this morning. And I told her that our liberty and our freedom was so precious, and liberty and freedom was in danger. And we had to call upon those who were capable and equipped to help us protect it. And all of us in our own way were doing the very best we could to preserve freedom, and that I did think it was necessary. The mother had said in her letter that if t felt that, that she would not , under any circumstances, object, although she did have to admit that while she did not want him out of the service, and she did not want him not to face up to his duty, she had to admit that she did not look with any favor to his going to that place at this time. So, those of you who in a short time will be in the service of your country in one capacity or another, know how blessed you are to live in a system that was inherited by you as the result of the sacrifice of many thousands of young men like yourselves. I believe that as you leave your present work that you will have gained from the halls of the Congress a sense of duty and a sense of responsibility that will always make the job of serving your country a pleasant one for you.

{"id": 775, "text": "My fellow Americans. With the New Year just a few weeks away, Washington is starting to get ready for the 100th Congress, which will be sworn in this January. The most important challenge facing that Congress will be joining with us in keeping a growing America on the road to a brighter future, the road that you and I and all Americans started on just 6 years ago. That was when we said that the way to make America grow was not by feeding government more of your tax dollars but by the way that America has always grown: through the ingenuity, energy, and determination of the American people. Together we set out to cut your taxes and cut the growth of government spending so that you could get on with the important work of building a better future for yourself, your family, and all America. We first cut tax rates with our 1981 tax cut. Since the lower tax rates in that bill took effect, America has created over 12 million new jobs. We have had 48 straight months of economic growth and one of the longest periods of uninterrupted growth in the last 50 years. And after a decade-long decline, the American family's real income has been rising again and rising faster. Yes, thanks to our first tax cut, there are more and better jobs, more new businesses, and more new opportunities in America today than ever before in our history. But that is just the beginning; because earlier this year, with your help, Congress pushed aside the special interests and the tax-and-spend crowd, rolled up its sleeves, and shaped the tools that will help you and all Americans build on that record. That is when Congress passed the new tax reform bill, which will cut the top tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and for 8 out of 10 Americans will mean a top rate of no more than 15 percent. For the 4 years since our first tax cut found its footing, the American economy has been climbing to the mountaintop. With tax reform, America is going to shoot for the stars. That is why I was disappointed this week to hear some talk from the new Congress that we should stop the climb, turn around, and start back in the direction we have come from. Even before they take their oath of office, some in the new Congress are talking about breaking faith with the American people and taking back part of tax reform before it has taken effect. Yes, they say that to reduce the deficit they want to keep some people's tax rates high. Well, we know where that road leads. First, they take one step towards raising taxes and then another and then another, and pretty soon every family in America is paying more to the Government again and we are back to the days of high taxes and no economic growth. Well, you can be sure I am not going to let that happen. I hope that instead of trying to return to the tax-and-spend policies of the past, the new Congress will work with us in getting the growth of Federal spending under control. We have begun to make progress here, too. The figures are coming in now for the spending the Government is actually doing this year, and the news is good. When this year is ended, the deficit will be down by $50 billion. Yes, this year, for the first time in two decades, the Federal Government will spend less, after taking out inflation, than it did last year. That is an historic step on the road to a balanced budget, and it could not have happened without the Gramm-Rudman legislation. Now it is time to take a second step. On January 5th we will send next year's budget up to Capitol Hill. It will be the Federal Government's first trillion-dollar budget request. It will be lean enough to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets, but it will also meet the Government's commitments. We will be spending more than ever before in such areas as support for America's elderly, law and drug enforcement to protect America's young people, and health care for America's finest-for our veterans. And yet in the coming budget, after taking out inflation, the Federal Government will spend less in the coming year than it will this year. That will be 2 years of real falling spending. We in the administration have worked hard to meet the new, earlier deadline for sending this budget to Congress. I hope Congress will work just as hard to meet its required deadlines and not let them slip by, as has happened too many times in the past. And I hope the new Congress will take a constructive approach to this firm but fair budget. We are bound to disagree here and there, but let us work together for the good of the country to iron out our differences. The leadership of the outgoing 99th Congress gave America lower tax rates and began the process of putting the lid on spending. As we look to the new year, this is the challenge for the leadership of the incoming 100th Congress: to build on that record and help lead America into the future. I hope they will accept that challenge. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationeconomicgrowthandbudgetreform", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on Economic Growth and Budget Reform", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-economic-growth-and-budget-reform", "publication_date": "13-12-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 666, "text": "It is nice to meet personally with a group with whom I spend about 10 hours a day. The music that you make not only pleases ENTITY , but I think it extends the beneficial impact of American life throughout the world. As you well know, because you have achieved this high standard of accomplishment, the American sound recording industry has indeed been innovative, dynamic, pleasant, profitable, and- -I was just trying to see which one of those adjectives appealed to you most. But for people who have the talent to both create and produce sound recordings, I want to express my thanks to you as ENTITY. I have got a lot of friends in this room. You have been my friends when the Jimmy Carter performance was on the top of the chart and also when it was on the bottom. And I thank you for it very much. I understand that my dancing partner, Beverly Sills, is here. Is she? Is Beverly here? Hi, beautiful. Good to see you. I understand that she is going to be honored tonight with your top award for cultural music performer. In this very room, not too long ago, she not only thrilled a very wonderful audience but she gave me a good dancing lesson, and I enjoyed being with her. And I have just walked over here with Chet Atkins. I have been a fan of his for 20 years or more, and I still listen to his music often. Last night he was in Ohio with my wife, and she called about 9:30 to say that his performance there not only was an inspiration to her personally, and his friendship was very important to her, but the whole audience that heard him play his guitar were electrified, as usual. You are not surprised at that. I might say this is not the first time he has had an interrelationship with the Carter family. He started out with them, or they with him, a long time ago in Nashville, I do want to say that Chet Atkins, who is practically a classical performer-we had Andres Segovia play in this room a couple of Sundays ago-and Chet, also represent the highest kind of personal artistic achievement-Beverly Sills, who has made opera come to life for many people with her personal beauty and her acting talent as well as her lovely voice-represent the gamut of offerings that you have made available to us in this great country and also throughout the world. And I am deeply indebted to you personally and want to express, on behalf of more than 200 million Americans, our thanks for what you mean to us. I believe that you know how close I feel to many of you personally. Phil Walden, 1 a good Georgian, informed me when I was Governor about some of the problems with the pirating of recordings and soundtapes. We passed an excellent bill in Georgia to correct that deficiency, and I began to understand a little more about your industry from his instruction and his concern. And, of course, as you also know, I have been to your conventions and have met many of you in very favorable circumstances. This is your home. We have a very good partnership throughout our country. Many things divide Americans, one from another-differences of perspective, background, interests. And, of course, many more things divide Americans from other people throughout the world. International borders are very difficult to bridge. Tedious, long negotiations are sometimes necessary to tear down hatreds, misunderstandings, animosities. But I think if there is one industry that I can imagine that has been successful in bridging these gaps and bringing an alleviation of tension and a better understanding of one another not only in our own country but throughout the world, across the most impenetrable political borders, it has been the sound recording industry. And I do not know if you think about your achievement in this way, but as ENTITY, it is a very sobering and a very gratifying thought for me. And I want to congratulate you, welcome you here to the White House, thank you for your tremendous achievements in the past. And I believe that the future will see an even brighter future for you and for your industry and for peace and harmony, understanding, good will, even love throughout the world.

{"id": 1033, "text": "Before my remarks, I have a brief announcement. Anyone that has not gotten his cuff links or tickets to the Kennedy Center, please see Max Friedersdorf. Well, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Cabinet and staff and all of you who are here, I do not think the East Room has ever seen exactly this kind of meeting here before. And I think last week we saw an extraordinary example of cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of government, and I want all of you Members of the House to know how deeply grateful I am for what you did last week. During these past 112 days we have worked well together, and I think we have made a little history. Thanks to you, we have made it clear that spending can be controlled and that our system works. The voice of the people can be heard here in the Capital, and in so doing, we have restored their confidence of our people in their government and in the institutions of this Government. I know that what we did was only the first step, but I have confidence that in the weeks and months ahead we will continue to put country ahead of partisanship. Yes, we have a big job ahead of us putting tax cuts into effect that are really the other half of returning America's prosperity. I believe the reduction in the tax rates, as I know I have said to many of you, is essential to restoring the spirit of enterprise. You know, some years ago there was an economist at Harvard, now deceased, Sumner Schlichter. And he said once that if a visitor from Mars came to Earth, he would conclude that our tax policy had been created to make private enterprise unworkable. And, you know, maybe what he was talking about, sometimes in a business or a sports team or an army, will outperform its competitor even though the material assets of the two seem to be roughly equal. Now, some academicians have commented-well, they have referred to this as the x factor in human affairs, a confidence or a spirit that makes men and women dream and dare and take greater risks. Well, for too long a time our tax structure has stifled that x factor and that spirit of confidence and daring in our economic doings here in our land. Those who have the means to invest have sought tax shelters instead. And workers have been discouraged from saving or even trying to increase their earnings by increasing their productivity. I think the people have told us they want to see America return to the can-do spirit that made this country an industrial and economic giant. Would I be wrong in suggesting that all of us here today feel a kind of special closeness? It is a feeling, I think, born of standing together for something we believed in. And I appreciate the courage it took for some of you to take that stand. I hope that we can maintain this bond established so far in the days to come. And again, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheprogramforeconomicrecoverywhitehousereceptionformembersthehouse", "title": "Remarks on the Program for Economic Recovery at a White House Reception for Members of the House of Representatives", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-program-for-economic-recovery-white-house-reception-for-members-the-house", "publication_date": "11-05-1981", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 932, "text": "Chief justice, senators, learned counsel for the president, you will be pleased to know this is the last presentation of the evening. And as I started last night, I made reference to some good advice I got from a encouraging voice that said, Keep it up but not too long. Tonight I got some equally good advice, To be immortal, you do not need to be eternal. And I will do my best not to be eternally eternal. First point I'd like to make is I am tired. I do not know about you but I am exhausted. And I can only imagine how you feel, but I am also very deeply grateful for just how you have attended to these presentations and discussions over the last few days. I am deeply grateful. I can tell how much consideration you have given to our point of view and the president's point of view and that is all we can ask. At the end of the day, all we can ask is that you hear us out and make the best judgment that you can consistent with your conscience and our constitution. Now, I wanted to start out tonight with where we began when we first appeared before you about a week ago, and that is with the resolution itself. With what the president is charged with in the articles and how that holds up now that you have heard the evidence from the house. Donald Trump was impeached in article one for abuse of power. And that article provides that in his conduct of the Office of President of the United States and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the United States and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States, and is in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Donald J. Trump has abused the powers of his presidency in that using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States presidential election. President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 election. That has been proved. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and influence 2020 US presidential election to his advantage. That has been proved. President Trump also sought to pressure the government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official US government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. That has been proved. President Trump engaged in the scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. That has been proved. In doing so, President Trump used the power of the presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process. That has been proved. He thus ignored and injured the interests of the nation. That has been proved. President Trump engaged in the scheme or course of conduct through the following means. President Trump acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the United States government corruptly solicited the government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into, A, a political opponent, Former Vice President, Joseph R. Biden Jr. That has been proved. A discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that Ukraine rather than Russia interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election. That has been proved. With the same corrupt motives, President Trump acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the US government conditioned to official acts on the public announcements that he had requested the release of $391 million of US taxpayer funds that Congress had appropriated on a bipartisan basis for the purpose of providing vital military and security assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and which President Trump had ordered suspended. That has been proved. And B, a head of state meeting at the White House, which the president of Ukraine sought to demonstrate continued United States support for the government of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. That has been proved. Faced with public revelation of his actions, President Trump ultimately released the military and security assistance to the government of Ukraine, but has persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to undertake investigations for his personal political benefit. That has been proved. These actions were consistent with President Trump's previous invitations of foreign interference in US elections. That has been proved. In all of this, President Trump abused the powers of the presidency by ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit. That has been proved. He also betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections. That has been proved. Wherefore, President Trump by such conduct has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self governments and the rule of law. That has been proved. President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. That will be for you to decide. But the facts have been proved. Those facts are not contested. We have met our burden. Article two, obstruction of Congress. The constitution provides that the House of Representative shall have the sole power of impeachment and the president shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. In his conduct of the Office of the President, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the Office of President United States and to the best of his ability preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, Donald J. Trump has directed the unprecedented categorical and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant to its sole power of impeachment. That has been proved. President Trump has abused the powers of the presidency in a manner offensive to and subversive of the constitution in that the House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of the government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 US presidential election. That has been proved. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the committee's undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry for various executive branch agencies and offices and current and former officials. That has been proved. In response without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed executive branch agencies, offices and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. That has been proved. President Trump thus interpose the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives and assume to himself functions and judgements necessary to exercise the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the House of Representatives. That has been proved. President Trump abused the powers of his high office through the following means. Number one, directing the White House to defy a lawful subpoena by withholding the production of documents sought therein by the committees. That has been proved. Directing other executive branch agencies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of documents and records from the committees in response to which the Department of State, the Office of Management Budget, Department of Energy and Department of Defense refused to produce a single record or document. That has been proved. Direct and current and former executive branch officials not to cooperate with the committees in response to which nine administration officials defied subpoenas for testimony namely John Michael Mick Mulvaney, Robert B. Blair, John A. Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Griffith, Russell T. Vought, Michael Duffey, Brian McCormack and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. That has been proved. These actions were consistent with President Trump's previous efforts to undermine United States government investigations into foreign interference in US elections. That has been proved. Through these actions, President Trump sought to arrogate himself the right to determine the propriety scope and nature of an impeachment inquiry into his own conduct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and all information to the House of Representatives in the exercise of its sole power of impeachment. That has been proved. In the history of the Republic, no president has ever ordered the complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct and impede so comprehensively the ability of the House of Representatives to investigate high crimes and misdemeanors. That has been proved. The abuse of office serve to cover up the president's own repeated misconduct and to seize and control the power of impeachment and thus to nullify a vital safeguard vested solely in the House of Representatives. That has been proved. In all of this, President Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. That has been proved. Whereas or wherefore, President Trump by such conduct has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self government and the rule of law. That has been proved. President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. That will be for you to determine. Let me say something about this second article. The facts of the president's defiance of Congress are very simple because they were so uniform. Because they were so categorical. Because they are so uncontested, but too do not mistake for a moment the fact that it was simple and easy and quick to present that course of conduct compared with a sophisticated campaign to coerce Ukraine into thinking that that second article is any less significant than the first. Do not believe that for a moment. If there is no article two, let me tell you something, there will never be an article one. If there is no article two, there will never of any kind or shape or form be an article one. And why is that? Because if you and we lack the power to investigate a president, there will never be an article one. Whether that article one is abuse of power or that article one is treason or that article one is bribery, there will never be an article one if the Congress cannot investigate an impeachable offense. If the Congress cannot because the president prevents it investigate the president's own wrongdoing, there will never be an article one because there will be no more impeachment power. It will be gone. It will be gone. As I said before, our relationship with Ukraine will survive. God willing, our relationship with Ukraine will survive and Ukraine will prosper and we will get beyond this ugly chapter of our history. But if we are to decide here that a president of the United States can simply say under article two, I can do whatever I want and I do not have to treat a coequal branch of government like it exists. I do not have to give it any more than the back of my hand. That will be an unending injury to this country. Ukraine will survive and so will we, but that will be an unending injury to this country because the balance of power that our founders set out will never be the same. Will never be the same. If a president can simply say, I am going to fight all subpoenas, and I will tell you something else. Truism in the courts is just as true here in the Senate where they say justice delayed is justice denied. You give this president or any other the unilateral power to delay as long as he or she likes, to litigate matters for years and years in the courts and do not fool yourself into thinking it is anything less. In April, it will be a year since we subpoenaed Don McGahn and there is no sign of an end to that case. I will tell you, when it gets to the Supreme court, you might think that is the end and that is just the end of the first chapter because Don McGahn is in court saying, I am absolutely immune from testimony. Now that is been rejected by every court that is looked at it. But we will see what the Court of Appeal says and then we will see if it goes to an en banc Court of Appeals. And then we will see what the Supreme Court says. And when we prevail on the Supreme Court, you know what happens? That is not the end of the matter. It comes back to the trial court and then Well, they cannot claim absolute immunity more. They cannot claim that We do not even have to bother showing up. So now we are going to turn to plan B, executive privilege. We are going to say we cannot and will not answer any of the questions that are really pertinent to your impeachment inquiry. And let us start out in district court and then go to the Court Appeals and then go en banc and then go to the Supreme Court. You can game the system for years. Justice delayed is justice denied and so is true about presidential accountability. So when you suggest or I suggest or anyone suggests or the White House suggest, why does not the Congress, why did not the house just exhaust their remedies as if in the constitution where it says, The house shall have the sole power of impeachment. There is an asterisk that says, After exhausting all court remedies and for seeking court in the district court and then seeking relief in the court of appeals and after that, go in the Supreme Court. Let us not kid ourselves about what that really means. What that really means is you allow the president to control the timing of his own impeachment or if it will ever be permitted to come before this body. That is not an impeachment power. That is the absence of an impeachment power. Article two is every bit as important as article one. Without article two, there is no article one ever again. No matter how egregious this president's conduct or any other, it is fundamental to the separation of powers. If you cannot have the ability to enforce an impeachment power, you might as well not put it in the constitution. Now, shortly, the president's lawyers will have a chance to make their presentation and as we will not have the ability to respond to what they say, I want to give you a little preview of what I think they are going to have in store for you so that when you do hear it, you can put it into some perspective. I expect that they will attack the process. I do not think that is any mystery, but I want to tell you both what I expect they will share it with you and what it really means. When you cut through all the chaff, what does it really mean that they are saying? So here is what I expect that they will tell you. The process was so unfair. It was the most unfair in the history of the world. Because of the house, they took depositions. How dare they take depositions? How dare they listen to Trey Gowdy? How dare they follow the Republican procedures that preceded their investigation? How dare they? And they were so secret in the bunker, in the basement, as if whether it is on the ground floor of the basement of the first floor makes any difference. Those super secret depositions in which only a hundred members of Congress equivalent to the entire Senate could participate. That is how secret they were. That is how exclusive they were. Every Democrat, every Republican on three committees could participate. Of course, that was not enough so you had even more storm the SCIF. Right? So you have a hundred people can participate, but you heard earlier, but the Republicans were not allowed to participate. Okay. That is just false. You know how we did it in those super secret depositions and you could look this up yourself because we released the transcripts. We got an hour. They got an hour. We got 45 minutes. They got 45 minutes. And we did that back and forth until everyone was done asking their questions. Now, you will hear, Oh, ENTITY was so unfair. He would not allow us to ask our questions. Well, there were certain questions I did not allow. Questions like, who is the whistle blower? Because we want to punish that whistle blower. Because yes, some of us in this house and in this house believe we ought to protect whistle blowers. So yes, I did not allow the outing of the whistle blower. So when they say the chairman would not allow certain questions, that is what they mean. That means that we protect people who have the courage to come forward and blow the whistle. That we do not think, though the president might, that they are traitors and spiced. To believe that someone who blows the whistle on misconduct of the serious nature that you now know took place is a traitor or a spy. There is only one way you can come to that conclusion. And that is if you believe you are the state and that anything that contradicts you is treason. That is the only way that you can conceive of someone who exposes wrongdoing is a trader or a spy. But that is exactly how this president views those who expose his wrongdoing because he is the state. Like any good Monarch, he is the state. And you will hear, The president was not allowed to participate in the judiciary committee. Well, that is false too as you have heard. The president had the same rights in our proceedings as President Nixon and President Clinton. But nonetheless, you will hear, It was so unfair. And one other thing that was really unfair is all the subpoenas were invalid because the house did not pass a resolution announcing its impeachment inquiry. Never mind that we actually did. The problem was they said, Well, we had not , and then we did. And then the problem was, Well, you did. Well, of course, as you know, the constitution says the house will have the sole power of impeachment. If we want to do it by house resolution, we can do it by house resolution. If we want to do it by house resolution, we can do it by house resolution. If we want to do it by committee, we can do it by committee. It is not the President's place to tell us how to conduct an impeachment proceeding any more than it is the President's place to tell you how you should try it. When you see that eight-page diatribe from the White House council saying, We should have been able to have a resolution in the House, or, We should have been able to have this, what you should hear, what they really mean is, Donald Trump had the right to control his own impeachment proceeding, and it is an outrage that Donald Trump did not get to write the rules of his own impeachment proceeding in the House. You give a president that right, there is no impeachment power. When you hear them say that, when you hear them complain about depositions that were the same as the Republicans, or the right to participate, that was the same in Clinton and Nixon. By the way, they were not allowed to call witnesses, they said. Three of the 12 witnesses that we heard at our open hearings were the minority witness requests. You will hear those arguments, the most unfair and history. The fact is we had the same process. In those other impeachments, the majority did not surrender its subpoena power to the minority. You know what it did? It said, You can subpoena witnesses, and if the majority does not agree you can force a vote. That is the same process we had here. The majority does not surrender its subpoena power. Did not in the prior impeachments, did not in this one. When they say the process was unfair, what they are really mean is do not look at what the President did. For God's sake, do not look at what the President did. Now, you will also hear, I think the second thing you will hear from the President's team is, Attack the managers. Those managers are just awful. They are terrible people. Especially that ENTITY guy. He is the worst. He is the worst. Exhibit A, he mocked the President. He mocked the President. He mocked the President as if he was shaking down a leader of another country, like he was an organized crime figure. He mocked the President. He said it was like the President said, 'Listen, Zelensky, because I am only going to say this seven times.' I discovered something very significant by mocking the President. That is, for a man who loves to mock others, he does not like to be mocked. Turns out, he is got a pretty thin skin. Who would've thought it? Nevermind that I said I was not using his words before I said it, and I was not using his words after I said it, and I said I was making a parody of his words. It is an outrage. He mocked the President. That ENTITY, terrible. Now, they will attack my other colleagues too, for things said in the heat of debate here on the floor as we were reaching the wee hours of the morning. They will attack some of my colleagues who are not even in this chamber. Maybe they will attack the squad. That is a perennial favorite with the President. If they attack the squad you should ask, What does that have to do with the price of beans? You can expect a tax on all kinds of members of the House that have nothing to do with the issues before you. When you hear those attacks you should ask yourself, Away from what do they want to distract my attention? Nine times out of 10 it will be the President's misconduct, but look for it. Attacks on the managers, attacks on other House members, attacks on the speaker, attacks on who knows what. It is all of the same ilk. Whatever you do, just do not consider the President's misconduct. You will also hear attacks on the constitution. Of course, it will not be framed as an attack on the constitution, but that is really what it represents. That is, abusive power does not violate the constitution. Presidents of United States have every right to abuse their power. That is the argument. Okay, I know it is a hard argument to make, right? Presidents have a constitutional right to abuse their power, and how dare the House of Representatives charge a president with abusing his power. Now, I am looking forward to that constitutional argument by Alan Dershowitz, because I want to know why abusing power and trust is not impeachable now, but it was a few years ago. The last time I checked, I do not think there was a significant change to the constitution between the time he said it was impeachable, and the time he is saying now that apparently it is not impeachable. I am looking forward to that argument, but I am also looking forward to Ken Starr's presentation. During the Clinton impeachment, he maintained that a president not only could, but must be impeached for obstructing justice. That Bill Clinton needed to be impeached because he lied under oath about sex, and to do so obstructed justice. You can be impeached for obstructing justice, but you cannot be impeached for obstructing Congress. Now, I have to confess, I do not know exactly how that is supposed to work. The logical conclusion from that is, Ken Starr saying that Bill Clinton's mistake was in showing up under subpoena. That Bill Clinton's mistake was not saying, I am going to fight all subpoenas. That Bill Clinton's mistake was in not taking the position that under Article Two, he could do whatever he wanted. Does that really make any sense? You can be impeached for obstructing your own branch of government, but you cannot be impeached for obstructing a co-equal branch of government. That would make no sense to the framers. I have to think, over the centuries as they have watched us, they would be astonished that anyone would take that argument seriously, or could so misapprehend how this balance of power is supposed to work. I look forward to that art argument. Maybe when they make that argument they can explain to us why their position on abusive power is not even supported by their own attorney general. I hope they will answer why even their own attorney general does not agree with them. Not to mention, by the way, the constitutional law expert called by the Republicans in the House who also testified as to abuse of power, that it is impeachable. That you do not need a crime that is impeachable. Now, when you hear them make these arguments, cannot be impeached for abusing your power, this is what it really means. We cannot defend his conduct, and so we want to make it go all away without even having to think about that. You do not even need to think about what the President did, because the House charged it wrong. So, do not even consider what the President did. That is what that argument means. We cannot defend the indefensible, so we have to fall back on, even if he abused his office, even if he did all the things he is accused of, that is perfectly fine. There is nothing that can be done about it. Now, you will also hear, as part of the defense, and you heard this from Jay Sekulow, was I think the last thing he said, The whistleblower, and then he stepped back to the table. The whistleblower. Now, I do not really know what that meant, but I suspect you will hear more of that. The whistleblower. The whistleblower. It is his, or her fault that we are here. The whistleblower. I would encourage you to read the whistleblower complaint again. When you read that complaint again, you will see just how remarkably accurate it is. It is astonishingly accurate. For all the times the President is out there saying that the complaint was all wrong, It was all wrong, you read it, now that you have heard the evidence, you read it and you will see how remarkably right the whistleblower got it. Now, when that complaint was filed, it was obviously before we had our depositions, and had our hearings. All of which obviated the need for the whistleblower. In the beginning we wanted the whistleblower to come and testify, because all we knew about was the complaint. Then, we were able to hear from firsthand witnesses about what happened, and then something else happened. the President and his allies began threatening the whistleblower, and the life of the whistleblower was at risk. What was the point in exposing that whistleblower to the risk of his, or her life when we had the evidence we needed? What was the point, except retribution. Retribution, and the President wants it still. You know why the President is mad at the whistleblower? Because, but for the whistleblower, he would not have been caught, and that is an unforgivable sin. He is the State and but for the whistleblower, the President would not have been caught. For that, he is a spy and he is guilty of treason. Now, what does he add to this? Nothing, but retribution. A pound of flesh. You will also hear the President's defense, They hate the President. They hate the President. You should not consider the presence misconduct because they hate the President. Now, what I have said, I leave you to your own judgments about the President. I only hate what he is done to this country. I grieve for what he is done to this country. When they make the argument to you that this is only happening because they hate the President, it is just another of the myriad forms of, please do not consider what the President did. Whether you like the President, or you dislike the President is immaterial. It is all about the constitution, and his misconduct. If it meets the standard of impeachable conduct as we approved, it does not matter what you like him. It does not matter what you dislike him. What matters is whether he is a danger to the country, because he will do it again. None of us can have confidence, based on his record, that he will not do it again because he is telling us every day that he will. Now, you will hear the further defense that Biden is corrupt. That Joe Biden is corrupt, that Hunter Biden is corrupt. This is their defense. This'll be another defense, because what they hope to achieve in the Senate trial is what they could not achieve through their scheme. If they could not get Ukraine to smear the Bidens, they want to use this trial to do it instead. Let us call Hunter Biden. Let us smear the Bidens. Let us succeed in the trial with what we could not do with this scheme. That is the goal. Now, I do not know whether Rudy Giuliani, who said he was going to present his report to some of the senators has presented his report. Maybe he has. Maybe you will get to see what is in Rudy Giuliani's report. Maybe you will get to see some documents smearing the Bidens produced by who knows. Maybe these same Russian corrupt former prosecutors. Make no mistake about what that is about. It is about completing the object of the scheme through other means, through the means of this trial. You may hear the argument that what the President is doing when he is obstructing Congress is protecting the office for future presidents, because there is nothing more important to Donald Trump than protecting the office of the presidency for future presidents. I supposed, when he withheld military aid from Ukraine he was trying to protect future presidents. When he sought to coerce a foreign power to intervene in our election, he was doing it on behalf of future presidents, because future presidents might likewise wish to cheat in a further election. I do not think that argument goes very far, but I expect you will hear it. I expect you will hear it. You may hear an argument that the President was really concerned about corruption, and he was concerned about burden sharing. I will not spend much time on that because you have heard the evidence on that. There is no indication that this had anything to do with corruption in every, every bit of evidence that it had nothing to do with fighting corruption, or burden sharing. Indeed, nothing about the burden changed between the time he froze the aide and the time he released the aid. There was no new effort to get others to contribute more, and Europe contributes a great deal as it is. This is an after-the-fact rationalization. You probably saw the public reporting that there was an exhaustive effort after the fact to come up with a post-talk rationalization for this scheme. I would like to show you the product of that investigation, but I will need your help because it is among the documents they refuse to turn over. They will show you just what an after- the-fact invention this argument is. Now, I expect you will hear the argument, Obama did it. Obama did it. Now, that may take several different forms, but the form of Obama did it that I am referring to is, Obama also withheld aid. Honestly, I think that argument is an insult to our intelligence because the argument is, Obama withheld aid from Egypt, and he made a condition with it. Obama withheld aid from Egypt after they had a revolution, and circumstances change. You know something? He did not hide it from Congress. In fact, Congress supported it. Yes, there are times when we withhold aid for a good policy reason. Not a corrupt effort to get help in your election. The American people know the difference between right and wrong. They can recognize the difference between aid that is withheld for a malicious purpose, and aid that is held in the best interest of our national security. But, you will hear the Obama did it argument. You will hear the call was perfect. You will hear the call was perfect. Now, I suspect the reason they will make the argument the call was perfect is because the President insists that they do. I do not think they really want to have to make that argument. You would not either, but they have a client to represent and so they will make the argument, the call was perfect. They will also make the argument, Ukraine thinks the call was perfect. Ukraine says there was no pressure. What that really means is Ukraine wants a future, Ukraine knows it is still beholden to us for aid, Ukraine still has not gotten in through the door of the White House. Ukraine knows that if they acknowledge that they were shaken down by the President of the United States, the President United States will make them pay. When you hear them say, Ukraine felt no pressure and their proof is because the Ukraine president does not want to call the President the United States a bad name, you will know why. Because they need America. They need America. The framers did not expect you to leave your common sense at the door. Now, you will also hear the defense, the President said there was no quid pro quo. the President said there was no quid pro quo. I guess that is the end of the story. This is a well-known principle of criminal law, that if the defendant says he did not do it, he could not have done it. If the defendant learns that he is been caught and he says he did not do it, he could not have done it. That does not hold up in any court in the land. It should not hold up here. You also hear a variation of the argument, No harm, no foul. They got the money. They got the money, and they got the meeting even though they did not . They got the meeting on the sideline of the UN. It was kind of a drive by, but they got a meeting. No harm, no foul, right? A meeting on the sidelines is pretty much the same thing, right? As a head of state meeting in the Oval Office? of course it is not. Why do you think at that meeting at the United Nations, the President of Ukraine was still saying, Hey, when am I going to get to come to town? He certainly recognizes the difference, and we should too. What is more, there is every bit of harm, every bit of foul in withholding aid from an ally at war, and releasing it only when you are caught. Russia knows now about the wedge in our relations with Ukraine. The moment Russia found out about this, and I have to imagine, given how good their intel services are they did not have to wait for Politico to break the story any more than Ukraine did. In fact, there is so deep a penetration of Ukraine. I would have to expect the Russians would have found out at least as early as the Ukrainians did, if not earlier. The moment Ukraine learned, and Russia learned, there was harm because Ukraine knew they could not trust us, Russia knew they could take advantage of us. There was immediate harm. Because someone is caught, because a scheme is thwarted, does not make that scheme any less criminal, and corrupt. You get no pass when you get caught. I expect one of the defenses you will see is, they will play you certain testimony from the House where my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ask questions like, Did the President ever say he was bribing Ukraine? Did you ever see him actually bribe Ukraine? Did you hear him say that he was going to bribe Ukraine? Did you personally see this yourself? If you did not see it, if he did not lay it out for you, then it could not have happened. Two plus two does not equal four. You are not allowed to consider anything except for a televised You are not allowed to consider anything except for a televised confession by the president, and even then, do not consider it. So, I imagine you will hear some of that testimony where witnesses are asked, they work for the defense department. Well, did the president ever tell you that he was conditioning the aid? Nevermind that these are people, do not necessarily even talk to the president, but I will expect you will see some of that. As I mentioned before, you will hear the defense, we claim privilege. You cannot impeach the president over the exercise of privilege. Nevermind the fact that they never claimed privilege. They never asserted privilege. And you know why? You know why they never actually invoked privilege in the house? Is because they know that if they did, they'd have to produce the documents and they'd have to show what they were redacting and they did not want to do even that. They knew the overwhelming majority of the documents and witness testimony, there was no even colorable claim of privilege. So, they did not want to even invoke it. All they would say is maybe someday. But you will hear that you cannot be impeached for a claim of privilege they never made. So, what do all these defenses mean? What do they mean? What do they mean collectively when you add them all up? What they mean is under Article Two, the president can do whatever he wants. That is really it. That is really it, stripped of all the detail and all the histrionics. What they want us to believe is the president can do whatever he wants under Article Two and there is nothing that you or the House can do about it. Robert Kennedy once said, Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential vital quality for those who seek to change the world which yields most painfully to change. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle. I have to say, when I first read that, I was not sure I agreed. Moral courage is a rarer quality than courage in battle, that just does not seem right. I was not sure I really agreed and for a democrat not to agree with a Kennedy is kind of a heresy. I am sure some of my GOP colleagues feel the same way about the Kennedy's from Louisiana. After all, what could be more brave than courage in battle? What could be more rare than courage in battle? But then, I got to visit, as I know all of you have, our service members around the world and see just how blessed we are with an abundance of heroes by the millions who have joined the service of this country. Service members who every day demonstrate the most incredible bravery. I just have the greatest respect for them, for people like Jason Crow and John McCain and Daniel Inouye and so many others who've served in this body and the other or who've never served in office. By the millions all around the country and all around the world. Most incredible respect. It is an amazing thing how common is their uncommon bravery. My father is 92, he is probably watching. He is part of the greatest generation, left high school early to join the service. He tried to enlist in the Marine Corp and he failed the physical. So, at the end of World War II, failed the physical. Bad eyesight and flat feet, which was apparently enough to fail the physical. So, two weeks later he went to try to enlist in the Army, thinking that maybe it is a different physical standard and even if it is not , maybe I will get a different examining physician. Turns out, same standard, same physician. He recognized my father and he said, Were not you here two weeks ago? And my father said, Yeah. He said, You really want to get in that bad? My father said, Yeah. And he was in the Army. Now the war was over and so he never left the United States. When he left the service, he went to the University of Alabama and about midway through he wanted to get on with his life and he left college and went out into the business world, something he always regretted, leaving college early. I think in many ways, he got a better education than I did. I think that I was lucky to get a good education, but I think those like Jason and others who served in the military and also went to school, got the best education, because I think there is certain things you can only learn by being in the military. Certainly, you cannot really learn, I think, about war without going to war and maybe there are things you just cannot learn about life without going to war. So, those of you that have served have the most complete education I think there is. Even so, is moral courage really more rare than that on the battlefield? Then I saw what Robert Kennedy meant by moral courage. Few, he said, are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues and the wrath of their society. Then I understood by that measure just how rare moral courage is. How many of us are willing to brave the disapproval of our fellows, the censure of our colleagues and the wrath of our society? Just as those who have served in uniform cannot fully understand, those who have not served in uniform cannot fully understand what military service means. So to there is a different kind of fraternity or sorority among those who have served in office. I always tell my constituents there are two kinds of jobs in congress and it is not Democrats and Republicans. It is those from a safe seat and those from an unsafe seat. I am sure the same is true of those from a safe state and an unsafe state. It is why I think there is a certain chemistry between members who represent those swing districts and states, because they can step into each others shoes. One of the things that we in this fellowship of office holders understand that most people do not is that real political courage does not come from disagreeing with our opponents but from disagreeing with our friends and with our own party, because it means having to stare down accusations of disloyalty and betrayal. He is a Democrat name only or she is a Republican in name only. What I said last night, if it resonated with anyone in this chamber, did not require courage. My views, as heartfelt as they are, reflect the views of my constituents. But what happens when our heartfelt views of right and wrong are in conflict with the popular opinion of our constituents? What happens when our devotion to our oaths, to our values, to our love of country, depart from the momentary passion of a large number of people back home? Those are the times that try our souls. CBS news reported last night that a Trump confidante said that GOP senators were warned, Vote against your president, vote against the president and your head will be on a pike. Now, I do not know if that is true. Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike. I have to say, when I read that, and again, I do not know if that is true, but when I read that I was struck by the irony. I hope it is not true. I hope it is not true. But I was struck by the irony of the idea when we are talking about a president who would make himself a monarch, that whoever that was would use the terminology of a penalty that was opposed by a monarch. A head on a pike. Just this week, America lost a hero, Thomas Railsback. He passed away on Monday, the day before this trial began. Some of you may have known or even served with congressman Thomas Railsback, he was a Republican from Illinois and a second ranking member on the house judiciary committee when that committee was conducting its impeachment inquiry into President Nixon. In July of 1974 as the inquiry was coming to a close Congressman Railsback began meeting with a bipartisan group of members of the house, three other Republicans and three Democrats. Here in the Senate, they might have called them the gang of seven. They gathered and they talked and they labored over language and ultimately helped develop a bipartisan support for the articles that led a group of Republican Senators, including Barry Goldwater and Howard Baker, to tell President Nixon that he must resign. Some say that the Nixon impeachment might not have moved forward were it not for those four courageous Republicans led by Congressman Railsback and it pained the congressman because he credited Nixon with giving him his seat, with getting him elected. He did it because he said, Because seeing all the evidence, it was something we had to do because the evidence was there. One of his aids, Ray LaHood, eulogized him saying, He felt an obligation to the constitution to do what is right. Now soon, members of this body will face the most momentous of decisions. Not as I said at the outset, between guilt and innocence, but a far more foundational issue. Should there be a fair trial? Shall the House be able to present its case with witnesses and documents through the use of subpoenas as has been case in every impeachment trial in history? Now the president's lawyers have been their case outside of this chamber, threatening to stall these proceedings with the assertion of false claims of privilege. Having persuaded this body to postpone consideration of the witnesses and documents, they now appear to be preparing the ground to say it will be too late to consider them next week. Consider this, of the hundreds of documents that we have subpoenaed, there is no colorable claim and none has been asserted. To the degree that you can even make a claim, that claim has been waived. To the degree that even superficially a claim would attach, it does not conceal misconduct. What is more, to the degree that there were a dispute over whether a privilege applied, we have a perfectly good judge sitting behind me, empowered by the rules of this body to resolve those disputes. When the Chief Justice decides, where a narrow application of privilege ought to apply, you will still have the power to overrule him. How often do you get the chance to overrule a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court? You have to admit, it is every legislators dream. So, let us not be fooled by the argument that it will take too long or persuaded that the trial must be over before the State of the Union. This is no parking ticket we are contesting, no shoplifting case we are prosecuting. It is a matter of high crimes and misdemeanors. How long is too long to have a fair trial? Fair to the president and fair to the American people. The American people do not agree on much, but they will not forgive being deprived of the truth and certainly not because it took a backseat to expediency. In his pamphlet of 1777, The American Crisis, Thomas Payne wrote, Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo the fatigue of supporting it. Is it too much fatigue to call witnesses and have a fair trial? Are the blessings of freedom so meager that we will not endure the fatigue of a real trial with witnesses and documents. President Lincoln in his closing message to congress in December 1862 said this, Fellow citizens we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. I think he was the most interesting president in history. He may be the most interesting person in our history. This man who started out dirt poor, dirt poor like hundreds of thousands of other people at the time, he had nothing. No money, no education, he educated himself. Educate himself, but he had a brain in that head, a brilliance in that mind, that made him one of the most incredible, not just presidents, but people in history. I think he is the most interesting character in our history. Out of the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of other Americans at the time, why him? Why him? I think a lot about history, as I know you do. Sometimes I think about how unforgiving history can be of our conduct. We can do a lifetimes work, draft the most wonderful legislation, help our constituents and yet we may be remembered for none of that, but for a single decision, we may be remembered, effecting the course of our country. I believe this may be one of those moments. A moment we never thought we would see. A moment when our democracy was gravely threatened and not from without but from within. Russia too has a constitution. It is not a bad constitution, it is just a meaningless one. In Russia, they have trial by telephone. They have the same ostensible rights we do to a trial, they hear evidence and witnesses, but before the verdict is rendered, the judge picks up the telephone and calls the right person to find out how it is supposed to turn out. Trial by telephone. Is that what we have here, trial by telephone? Someone on the other end of the phone dictating what this trial should look like. The founders gave us more than words. They gave us inspiration. They may have receded into mythology but they inspire us still and more than us, they inspire the rest of the world. They inspire the rest of the world. From their prison cells in Turkey, journalists look to us. From their internment camps in China, they look to us. From their cells in Egypt, those who gathered in Tahrir Square for a better life, look to us. From the Philippines, those that were the victims and their families of mass extrajudicial killing, they look to us. From Elgin prison, they look to us. From all over the world, they look to us. Increasingly, they do not recognize what they see. It is a terrible tragedy for them, it is a worst tragedy for us, because there is no where else for them to turn. They are not going to turn to Russia, they are not going to turn to China, they are not going to turn to Europe with all of its problems. They look to us because we are still the indispensable nation. They look to us because we have a rule of law. They look to us because no one is above that law. One of the things that separates us from those people in Elgin Prison is the right to a trial. It is a right to a trial. Americans get a fair trial. So I ask you, I implore you, give America a fair trial. Give America a fair trial. She is worth it.

{"id": 865, "text": "It is indeed a signal honor to welcome to this Capital and to this house Their Majesties the King and Queen of Denmark. It is a country with which we are bound by ties of common ideals and principles, and ties of blood. Many of their people have come to this country and indeed, in their country, they celebrate one of our holidays. It has a long and interesting history. And of course, standing as it does as a buttress between the Baltic and the North Seas, it is not strange that they have had a long maritime history. But in these later days it is one of the key countries in the NATO alliance. It is a forward country. Geographically it looks across a very narrow gap to the threatening dictatorship that creates so much tension and indeed so much ill will in this world. So we are proud to call them friend and ally. We need them. We hope that they feel, on their part, a sense of partnership and need for us. I am sure they do. It is a romantic country. Many of you no doubt visited the Castle of Hamlet, and for my part at least, I was astonished to find out that Hamlet never lived in Denmark. It is a country of people calm and serene; they seem never to be startled, never to be hysterical. One great man said of his people: they were always hysterical in victory and panicky in defeat. I think the people of Denmark would be the last people that you could say that about, if you went there and wanted to make a generalization. In any event, it is a great country a prosperous country and above all, one with us, believing in the dignity of man and ready to put everything on the line; to risk even their existence in the defense of these values that free men feel are above all else in life. So you can realize that it is with a great sense of distinction that I ask you all to rise with me to drink to Their Majesties, the King and Queen of Denmark. The Queen and I are deeply moved by the kind words you have addressed to us and by the hearty welcome which you and Mrs. Eisenhower as well as the inhabitants of this beautiful city of Washington have given us. The kind hospitality with which we have been met by everybody during this first part of our stay in the United States has made a great impression on us and will always be kept in grateful memory by the Queen and myself. We have been looking forward with great expectations to this visit which I am sure will contribute to further strengthening of the ties of friendship which so happily unite our two countries. Twenty-one years have elapsed since in 1939 we had the opportunity of paying our first visit to the United States a tour of which we retain the most happy memories 21 years full of dramatic historic events. A world war with its terror and suffering for millions of people lies between then and now. During the dark years of war our two countries each with the means at her disposal aimed at promoting a common cause. We Danes realize how much we owe to the United States, to the courage and sacrifice of the American people, to the indomitable leadership of outstanding individuals as your memorable predecessors and you yourself, Mr. President, and to the dedicated efforts of the United States to achieve a peace based .on freedom and justice for all nations. I wish to take this opportunity to express on behalf of all my countrymen our gratitude towards the United States for their share in the liberation of our country. When peace had been achieved, we were faced with a series of new problems. As a result of the war the economy of my country like that of most other European countries had suffered severe setbacks. The rebuilding and expansion of our means of production and our merchant fleet and the revival of our commerce would not have been completed today had not the United States Government carried out their large-scale aid programs. Through this assistance the United States significantly helped the cause of economic integration in Western Europe. Your country thereby made an inestimable contribution to the unity of the states in our region. It is in my view a major interest, not only of Western Europe, but also of its friends in this hemisphere, that the cause of ever closer cooperation between European nations should enjoy the sympathy and active support of the United States of America. At the same time dark and menacing clouds were again gathering on the international horizon and prevented the peoples of the world from enjoying the peace for which they had fought so bitterly. Certainly those clouds still darken the sun, but thanks to inspiration and support from the United States the free nations of the Western World have joined their efforts to avert the threats to their national existence and their free way of life. Our country and yours are united in NATO. During the past 11 years we have had ample proof of the solidarity of the United States with NATO. We have benefited from the magnanimous aid which has enabled Denmark to build up a defense system without endangering the economic and social stability which are also important links in total defense. The contribution of Denmark to the defense of the whole NATO area is, of course, bound to be on a moderate scale. However, we are fully aware that solidarity with our allies is a necessity if the alliance is to fulfill its mission. The establishment of common defense areas in Greenland, upon which Denmark and the United States agreed in 1951, is one of the Danish contributions to that end. During our recent visit to Greenland the Queen and I had the pleasure to visit one of these areas and to inspect the forces stationed there. The high efficiency of these forces gained and deserved our sincere admiration. While both of us see in the alliance which unites us a purely defensive instrument and a successful means to avert the horrors of a new war, we are not closing our eyes to, but indeed seeking, all possible means to diminish the present tension in the world. We are grateful to you, Mr. President, for your untiring, personal efforts in the cause of peace and good will. They are the ultimate proof of the peaceful aims to which the policy of the United States as well as Denmark are dedicated. The close cooperation between our two countries in the United Nations and other international organizations is based on an identity of views with respect to the fundamental elements of life and stamped by mutual respect and sympathy. To this contribute in no slight degree the ties which unite many Americans of Danish origin with the land of their ancestors. for centuries Danes have gone to the United States to work and study. Many of them stayed on and founded their new homes in their country of adoption; we are happy to meet them here as esteemed and mostly prosperous citizens of this great country. New bonds of friendship have been created by the ever increasing numbers of American visitors coming to Denmark and Danes going to the United States. A most useful and ever increasing exchange of scientists, students, teachers, etc., has developed since the war thanks to American generosity and planning. This constitutes an essential factor in the cultural relations between our two countries. Tourist travel also is becoming possible for wider and wider groups of our citizens, thanks to the rising standards of living and the progress in the means of transportation. We Danes have always been proud of our merchant marine. In the field of air transportation we have by pooling our resources with our sister nations, Norway and Sweden significantly assisted in making connections between your country and Scandinavia easier and closer. These personal links across oceans and borders bear evidence of the freedom reigning in our countries. Let us unite in the hope that the torch of freedom which we received from our fathers may also illuminate the path of our descendants for generations to come. I raise my glass in honor of the President of the United States and Mrs. Eisenhower, for the prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandkingfrederikdenmark", "title": "Toasts of the President and King Frederik of Denmark", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-king-frederik-denmark", "publication_date": "11-10-1960", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 732, "text": "Thank you for that warm welcome, and welcome to the White House. I appreciate you giving us a chance to share with you our strategy on how we are going to win the war against terror. It starts with assembling a good team, and I put together a fabulous administration. I picked a great Vice President in Dick Cheney. Some of you may know him. But I know him a man who gives solid advice, and he is got great judgment. And the Nation's lucky that he left the left his previous occupation to serve our country. I am also pleased to be joined by three members of my Cabinet who are all involved with shepherding through an economic stimulus plan through the United States Congress. Secretary Paul O'Neill is doing a fabulous job. I have got great confidence in Paul and his ability to sell to the American people and to the United States Congress that which we are trying to do to make sure our economy grows. And I want to thank you, Paul, for your service, as well. Bob Zoellick is traveling the world promoting free trade. I will talk a little bit about trade later on. But I want to thank his tireless efforts. One thing that we are all hopeful for is that we start a new round of WTO talks at Doha, Qatar. And Bob's working hard to make that happen. I just have come from China, as you know, and he preceded me there, and they were still talking about the Zoellick touch. And I want to thank Spence Abraham, as well, who is helping us shepherd a realistic energy plan through the United States Congress. So thank you all for being here. We are at the beginning of what I view as a very long struggle against evil. We are not fighting a nation; we are not fighting a religion; we are fighting evil. And we have no choice but to prevail. We are fighting people that hate our values. They cannot stand what America stands for. And they really do not like the fact that we exist. And I want to assure you all that we will fight this fight on every front. We will use every resource we have. And there is no doubt in my time in my mind that in our time, we will prevail. There is no doubt. And we are fighting this war on a variety of fronts. We have put together a vast coalition of nations to slowly but surely encircle those who would terrorize and to send the message that their actions will not stand. I really appreciate the hard work of Secretary of State Powell. He is working endlessly to not only keep a coalition together but to broaden it. And it is working and it is working. We are fighting them on a financial front. We are choking off their money. We are seizing their assets. We will be relentless as we pursue their sources of financing. And I want to thank the Secretary of Treasury for leading that effort. We are sharing intelligence because in order to fight a war, the new war of the 21st century, we have got to know more about the enemy, where they try to hide, where they may try to strike next. And so we have got great cooperation with intelligence services from around the world, as well as great cooperation internally between the CIA and the FBI. The culture in our agencies have changed. We are now interested in preventing attack. We are now interested in finding those who may attack America and arrest them before they do. We have had over nearly 1,000 people have been detained in America and questioned about their motives and their intentions. The FBI is on full alert, and they take information garnered from around the world and share that information in a way that will make Americans proud. And we have also put our military into action. I have got great confidence in the American military. I have also got great confidence in our strategy, as we uphold this doctrine: It says, if you harbor a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you harbor anybody who has harmed America, you are just as guilty as those who have harmed our country. And therefore the Taliban Government, which we gave ample time to respond to reasonable demands, are now paying the price for harboring the Al Qaida organization, as they should. We are slowly but surely dismantling Taliban defenses, Taliban military installations, the Taliban command and control structure, all aimed at bringing the Al Qaida criminals to justice. It is the first battle in the war of terrorism. The American people are going to have to be patient, just like we are. They are going to have to be determined, just like our military is. And with that patience and with that determination, we will eventually smoke them out of their holes and get them and bring them to justice. And that is exactly what the world demands, and that is what the United States will deliver. It is hard for some Americans to realize that this is a two-front war. After all, history has basically said there would never be two fronts, one abroad and one in America. But we now have a second front on this war against terror here at home. We have been struck, obviously, on September the 11th, and we are being struck again. Anytime anybody puts anthrax in a letter, it is an act of terror. The press often ask me, Well, is this the is the evil one hiding from us in Afghanistan, the ones who have done this to America? I said, I do not know. We do not know yet. But we do know the evil one who hides thinks in ways that we cannot possibly think in America so destructive, such a low regard for human life. And anybody who puts anthrax, trying to kill American citizens, shares the same set of values. Whoever has done it shares that same value of evil that we saw on September the 11th. And we will find them and bring them to justice, as well. But we have got a strategy to fight the war on the homefront. As I mentioned, we are disrupting, as much as we possibly can, any possible attack on America. Every day I meet with the FBI Director and the Attorney General and Tom Ridge, who heads the Office of Homeland Security, to get a report on the activities that were taking place. We take every threat seriously. We respond to every piece of information we receive. As I mentioned, we have arrested or detained over 1,000 people here in America, to determine to find out what they know. And if they know something that is helpful, we will act on it. And we have got a great response mechanism in place. Today I mourned the lives of two who two postal officers who lost their life in the line of duty. But I can tell the American people that because of the hard work of many in our public health offices, I believe we have saved a lot of lives, too, by responding as quickly as we have. Today, right here in this room, I had the honor of signing a piece of antiterrorist legislation widely supported by Members of both parties in both Houses. It is needed legislation to help us do the job the American people expect, which is to protect the homeland. This is a two-front war. It is a two-front war, and it is a war we are going to win on both fronts. But make no mistake; the best way to make sure we protect our homeland is to succeed by bringing the terrorists abroad who try to strike us to justice. Now, there is another front on the war, as well, and that is our economy. And there is no question the terrorists want to cast a shadow of fear on the businesses of America. They understand how important our businesses are to our way of life. After all, the entrepreneurial spirit is strong in America. It is part of our culture. It is part of a hopeful society. And the more that can be disrupted, that spirit of commerce and enterprise, the more successful they think they will be. But they are not going to succeed there, either. In all our wars, the productive power of the economy has been one of our Nation's great advantages. And that is true today. But it is clear that our economy has been shocked. There is been shockwaves sent throughout all parts of the Nation's economic fabric. Obviously, we took a huge hit at the financial center of our country, in New York City. Our transportation system has been severely disrupted, which has, in turn, affected hotels and people who work in hotels. This administration is deeply concerned about those who have lost jobs. And we know there are a lot of Americans who hurt, and we hurt for them. And we are going to work with Congress to take the appropriate actions. I also know that some in this room have made a tough economic decision by delaying any layoffs or have chosen not to lay off workers, and I applaud you for that. And I thank you for making that decision, on behalf of the workers in America. I believe it is the right thing to do during this national emergency. But our Government must act wisely, as well. We must understand that our job is to help restore confidence in the future of the country in a way that is wise and sound. Buildings can be rebuilt, and they will be. Transportation systems will be invigorated, and they will be, as well. But the vitality of our economy depends upon the willingness of Americans to spend and for Americans to start new businesses to purchase new equipment and to invest in the future of this country. And I understand that. And we are taking practical steps, and let me share some of those with you. We are supporting American aviation with money and loans, to make sure the planes fly. We are also beefing up security at our airports, to make sure people feel safe in flying. And we are working with Congress to get a long-term law passed that will say to the American consumer and the American flyer, this Government is doing everything in our power to secure the airways on your behalf. As I mentioned, we are we have spent money in a supplemental to rebuild New York City and the Pentagon. It is the right thing to do. We have got SBA, the Small Business Administration, helping small businesses in the areas impacted by the attacks from the evil ones. We are paying for improved security at our post offices. We are just beginning to secure the post offices, in a way. You see, the post office obviously was set up as a way to efficiently deliver mail, not understanding that someone would dare use the mail as a weapon against America, and we are adjusting quickly to the new realities that we face. All this costs money, and we are spending it here in Washington. And when the money we have committed is spent, we believe it will have a positive effect on the economy. But we must be careful not to overspend. There is a lot of good ideas in Washington, and a lot of them cost a lot of money. And we must be careful to assess our needs and make sure we are cautious about how we spend taxpayers' money. We believe the best way to stimulate and restore confidence to the economy is not through additional spending but through tax relief. Tax relief arrives quickly. If we can get a bill out of both the House and the Senate, it will happen in quick fashion. Unlike spending programs, we will not have to wait for plans to be drafted and contracts to be let. The tax relief for new investment in the House stimulus package will go into effect as soon as the bill is signed, if we can get it out of the Senate. New lower tax rates for consumers and entrepreneurs will show up in paychecks on the first day of the next year of the new year, if we can get that passed out of the Senate. The tax rebates for low- and moderate-income folks would begin to arrive soon, if we can get it out of the Senate. Tax relief will put money rapidly into the hands of consumers. Tax relief will improve incentives to save and invest and will give a powerful boost to our national economy. And tax relief is efficient. When we have tried in the past to spend our way out of an economic slowdown, we have found that the money has often been spent unwisely. Tax relief, on the other hand, lets individuals decide for themselves what they need most. Tax relief lets economic resources flow to places where they can do the most good for the country. The House's tax relief plan accelerates some income tax reductions already planned for individuals and entrepreneurs and small businesses. This will give people opportunity to make decisions for themselves. And we have learned from experience that free decisions are usually the best decisions for our economy as a whole. And third, and most important, tax relief will expand productive investment. The House plan allows businesses to speed up the expensing of new equipment. And it reforms the corporate Tax Code, so that companies do not face higher effective rates as their profits decline. Together, these two changes will persuade many companies that time has come to reinvest in America. And when we invest in America, we create jobs for American workers. Tax relief is an essential step. But it is not the only step we should take. We need an energy plan for America. Under the leadership of the Vice President, we drafted a comprehensive, commonsense plan for the future of this country. It passed the House of Representatives. It needs a vote in the United States Senate. Oh, I understand energy prices are low right now, thank goodness. But that should not lead our Nation to complacency. We need to be more self-reliant and selfsufficient. It is in our Nation's national interest that we develop more energy supplies at home. It is in our national interest that we look at safe nuclear power. It is in our national interest that we conserve more. It is in our national interest that we modernize the energy infrastructure of America. It is in our national interest to get a bill to my desk, and I urge the Senate to do so. And we can restore economic confidence by expanding trade. More open trade is essential to the growth of our Nation's economy. A part of our economic recovery program is to give me the ability to negotiate trade agreements. I need trade promotion authority to expand opportunity for businesses large and small, for entrepreneurs in America. I need trade promotion authority to expand the job base of this great Nation. I am the first ENTITY who has not had trade promotion authority. I need it now. It is in our Nation's best interest that we have it. And it is in the best interests of our world that we trade in freedom. We have a chance to draw all the people into the world in the world into an open market economy, and that will offer better living standards and more political freedom and will enhance human dignity all across our globe. And it is our Nation's interest that that happen. Nobody is disqualified from an open world that trades freely. No one will be disqualified by religion, no one by nationality. No one will be disqualified by geography. Our enemies fear this world precisely because they know how attractive modernization is to the oppressed people around the globe. Our enemies fear open societies in which men and women can think for themselves, can decide their own destinies, can decently support their own families, can educate their sons and their daughters in a modern world. Our enemies fear a society which is pluralistic and open to worship an almighty God. Our enemies are right to fear open societies, because those societies leave no room for bigotry and tyranny. The promise of our time has no room for the vision of the Taliban or Al Qaida. This is a time of promise for America. I am incredibly optimistic about this Nation's future, because I understand America and I understand the people of America. Franklin Roosevelt warned us 70 years ago that fear feeds on itself and contributes to the very problems that first gave it rise. America has prevailed over fear in a Great Depression and in a global war, and we will do so again. The character of our country has not changed. Oh, the TV sets have changed; the telephones have changed; the cars have changed; but not the heart and soul of America. When they struck America, they did not understand our Nation. They did not understand our resolve. They did not understand our patience. They did not understand our will to win. I want to thank the Business Council for coming and for joining this war. All of us need to understand, it is now time to plant the flag of freedom firmly in our Nation and around the world, because what we do today will determine whether or not our children and our grandchildren can grow up in a life that we knew. What we do today will determine how free America is for the future. And we will not fail.

{"id": 1054, "text": "Thank you all. Please be seated. Thanks for coming out to say hello. It is great to be in southern Illinois. I appreciate the chance to come to Madison County. I am honored to be the first sitting ENTITY to visit the city of Collinsville. I am sorry Laura is not with me. That is generally the reaction. I was hoping she and I could go look at the Catsup Bottle. Thanks for waiting on me. I had a visit with some of the some folks from the area here, a neurosurgeon, a cardiologist, the administrator of a hospital, ob-gyn, a patient, all about the health care crisis that exists here in this part of the world. And that is what I am here to talk about. I am here to talk about how we need to fix a broken medical liability system. I want to thank all the good folks who provide health care for the folks in this part of the world, the nurses, the docs, the administrators. Thank you all for coming. Thanks for your compassion. Thanks for your care. Thanks for taking an active interest in an important issue that faces not only this part of the world but the country. But really what I am here to do is to make say as clearly as I can, the United States Congress needs to pass real medical liability reform this year. And there is no doubt in my mind we have a strong ally in this issue in the great Speaker of the House of Representatives from the great State of Illinois, Denny Hastert. And I want to thank Congressman John Shimkus for his leadership not only on this issue but on other issues. It is good to be with his wife, Karen, again, sons, David, Joshua, and Daniel. Nice to see you boys. And you brought Mom and Dad. Your mom is probably telling you what to do, just like mine is. You are probably listening about half the time, just like I am. Welcome. I am also proud to be traveling today with a great Congressman from Peoria, Illinois, Ray LaHood. Thank you, sir. Appreciate you coming. The State Treasurer of Illinois has joined us, Judy Baar Topinka. Appreciate you. Tom Cross is here. He is the minority leader in the house. I will tell you what he is doing in the house of representatives for the State of Illinois: He is leading the medical liability reform effort. And I want to thank you, Tom, for taking a strong role. Appreciate you coming. I know the mayor is here. Mr. Mayor yes, he is here, Stan Schaeffer. I appreciate you coming, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate you being here. I usually like to give mayors unsolicited advice: Fill the potholes. You have probably got some advice for me: Pass the highway bill. I want to thank those of you who are working on this medical liability issue here in the State of Illinois. I appreciate your efforts. Look, it is about time the medical profession gets involved. It is about time you let people know what is on your mind. It is time to make sure that the issue comes to the forefront not only at the Federal level but at the local level as well. I want to thank Connie Bergmann. I met Connie. She came out to the airport airbase, and kind of airbase-airport combo, I guess it is. She is a volunteer for the American Red Cross. The reason I bring her up is, every stop I make in America I like to herald a citizen who is taken time out of his or her life to volunteer to make the country a better place. See, the great strength of America is not our military might, and it is certainly not the size of our wallets. The great strength of America lies in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens, people who are willing to love a neighbor just like they'd like to be loved themselves, people who are willing to take time to volunteer to make America a better place. And Connie Bergmann is such a person. And I want to thank you for serving the Red Cross. And speaking about the Red Cross, the International Red Cross is doing heroic work in a part of the world that has suffered incredible, incredible death and destruction. The American people express our sympathy to the victims of the tsunami disasters. Yesterday I spoke to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, who I sent on a delegation with a delegation to assess the relief operations. And they reported in that the devastation is beyond comprehension. They also reported in that they will come back with an assessment about how we can more effectively help. But they also reported that our military is doing heroic work in helping to save life. They are flying rescue missions 24 hours a day. They are making a huge difference in the people's lives over there by delivering supplies directly to those in need. Our Government has not only stepped up with the use of military assets, but we have pledged $350 million in disaster assistance to help the people over there who are suffering. There is huge generosity here in America as well. As you know, I tapped a couple of ex-President's number 41 and number 42, to help out. I asked them to help, and they are. My dad and President Clinton have graciously given of their time to help make sure that people know there is a need and to make sure the donations are properly channeled into programs that work. If you want to help, get on the Internet for the USA www.usafreedomcorps.gov. There is a place to help. And on that web page, you will find different agencies which are doing the good work. What I do not want is, I do not want people to be sending money to places that are not really doing the job. We do not need to support organizations that are not effectively delivering compassion and help. And so on this web page, you will find a way to help, if you so desire to do so. What they tell me is, the most important contribution a person can give is cash, and let the agencies on the ground be able to use that cash to best meet the needs of those who have suffered. I want to thank all the Americans who thus far have been participating in this urgent cause. You are showing the true strength of America through your good heart. I do not know if you know this: This is my first trip after the New Year. And it is good to come here to Illinois. I am rested and ready to continue to serve to be your to continue to be your ENTITY and to serve the people of this country. And we have got a big agenda item a big agenda and a series of items that we will be dealing with. First of all, we are going to win the war on terror. We have still got to we will be steadfast. We will be resolved. We will be wise. We will not give in to these people. We have a duty in your Government to protect the American people. So the second big task at hand is to make sure we do everything we can to protect our homeland. And I will assure you I will continue to work to spread freedom and democracy and, therefore, peace in parts of the world that are desperate for freedom, democracy, and peace. We are going to work with the Congress to be wise about how we spend your money. We are going to keep your taxes low so this economy continues to grow. We are going to continue to work with our farmers and ranchers to make sure they can sell the products overseas, in markets where people need food and beef and pork. We are going to work to pass a national energy plan. We are going to work to cut our deficit in half over the next 5 years. And I look forward to working with members of both political parties to do something about our health care system. First, it is important for Americans to understand we have the best health care system in the world. And we need to keep it that way. We have got the best hospitals, both urban and rural. We have got the world's most talented and compassionate doctors and nurses. And we have got the world's and we lead the world in innovative research. We are on the cutting edge of change. We are saving lives through our research. Americans should be proud of our medical system, and we all must be grateful for those who work hard to provide compassion and care. Our health care system faces serious challenges. We all know that. The cost of health care is rising rapidly, and that burdens our families. It hurts our small businesses. It makes it harder for the job creators to expand the job base. Too many Americans are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we have got to take those steps this year. To improve health care in America, we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It is a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do. To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply 21st century information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our Medicare system still allows seniors to have choice in the system. There is a lot we can do. We have got to make sure we expand community health centers around our country to provide care for the poor and the indigent. And we have got to make sure low-income children are enrolled in government health care programs so they receive the care they need. These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by the Federal Government but by patients and doctors. To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. World-class medical technology is expensive. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. But some costs are not necessary. And that is what the American people must understand and Members of the United States Senate and the United States House must understand. Many of the costs that we are talking about do not start in an examining room or an operating room; they start in a courtroom. What is happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. That is just a plain fact. And they are doing it for a simple reason: They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in recent years. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system today. It is a system that is just not fair. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients. When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern Illinois and the people of America must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. For some physicians, even raising costs for patients is not enough to afford the premium increases caused by these lawsuits. And so physicians are faced with a terrible choice: give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine. And that problem affects all doctors, from family practitioners in rural towns to surgeons in big-city hospitals. In 2003, almost half of all American hospitals lost physicians or reduced services because of medical liability concerns. Think about that: One-half of all American hospitals lost physicians. Over the past 2 years, the liability crisis has forced out about 160 physicians in Madison and St. Clair counties alone. When doctors move or close their practices, guess who suffers: the patients, the people who live in these good towns in this part of the world. Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose critical minutes in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. America's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That is why doctors practice what is called defensive medicine. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains some 60 to 100 billion dollars from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand. This liability system of ours is, what I am telling you, is out of control. And you have people in this area and the doctors in this area understand what I am talking about. A recent study ranked Madison County the number one place in the country for trial lawyers to sue. And that is a ranking I am sure you'd like to get rid of. And those of you traveling in from St. Clair County are not doing much better. St. Clair is ranked the second county in America where you are likely to get sued. In other words, if you see a team of trial lawyers spending a lot of time in the Collinsville area, you can be pretty sure they are not looking for horseradish. Let me share some of the stories of the folks I met with today. I think this will help clarify what I am trying to say to you. Dr. Chris Heffner is with us. He is a neurosurgeon from Belleville Memorial and St. Elizabeth Hospitals. Raise your hand, Doc. He is one of only two neurosurgeons still practicing south of Springfield, Illinois. You have got two people in the area. In just 2 years, his annual premiums have more than doubled from $131,000 a year to $265,000 a year. And at the same time, his amount of insurance coverage has been cut in half. A few years ago, Chris decided that closing his head trauma part of his practice was the only way he could afford to stay in this area. He told me he loves living here in this part of the world. He likes to raise his family here. He and his wife made a tough decision to stay here, in spite of the fact that his premiums doubled and he got half the coverage. And so the only way he could stay here and to provide a level of care that he wants everybody to have was to cut out part of his practice. He still treats dozens of patients with spinal cord injuries, but now brain trauma victims in southern Illinois have to be airlifted across the river to St. Louis. He said, It is very distressing. I spent years of training to do brain surgery. It is a big part of my life. I made a commitment to stay here, but I had to make adjustments to keep the ax from falling. The system needs to be fixed. Dr. Greg Gabliani is with us. He is from Alton, and he is a cardiologist. He was raised in Quincy, and he moved to Madison County in 2001, even though his colleagues warned him about the medical liability crisis here. In 3 years, his premiums have risen from $12,500 to $60,000 a year 3 quick years. Last year he had to stop performing certain procedures to bring his costs under control. He said, You either have to change the nature of your practice, or you have to leave. He did not want to leave, so he is having to cut back on his services. We have got a problem, folks. I met with Bob Moore. He is the CEO of Red Bud Regional Hospital. That is big Bob. He is a father of six, I want you to know. His hospital has a long tradition of delivering babies, but this past November, he made the difficult decision to close his ob unit. The malpractice see, he had the they employ the doctors in his hospital. They become the employer. They are going to cover the insurance for them, and it doubled from $150,000 to $270,000 more than doubled. They are paying $270,000 a year now. That is a lot for a little hospital in a small town. Maybe for a big hospital, it is not a lot, or for those of us who are used to dealing with the Federal budget, it is not a lot. It is a lot for a small town hospital. Red Bud used to handle 120 deliveries a year. But now a lot of the women have to drive an hour to get to an ob unit. He said, You would not get an ob-gyn to come here. It is affecting rural medicine. It happens to be the medical liability crisis, is affecting rural medicine. Lawsuits are affecting rural medicine. It is a societal issue that has to be dealt with. I could not put it any better, Bob. It is a societal issue that we must deal with. It is a quality of life issue. We do not want our little towns being not having any health care. We want people who live in rural America, like Crawford, Texas to be able to get to have a quality of life . Leslie Scariano is with us. She is an ob-gyn from Alton. She spent her entire career as a doctor in southern Illinois, and she has never been sued. She is a good doc. She shut down her practice on December the 31st of this year because her premiums have skyrocketed out of control. That means she could not afford to stay in practice. She had a choice to make: quit practicing medicine, or go broke. She said, I do not want to quit practicing medicine and I am not going broke, so I am going to move to Colorado. You lost a good soul from this part of the world because the system is out of control. Leslie's premiums will be about 80 percent lower in Colorado than here in Illinois. I met with Kim Vogel, who is right with us yes, there she is. She was one of Leslie's patients. She is expecting her second child early next month like, soon. When she found out she was pregnant last year, Kim started seeing the ob-gyn that delivered her daughter, Katie. That ob-gyn moved to Tennessee. Then she started seeing Leslie. Leslie is moving to Colorado. Kim is now on her third ob-gyn, and she is worried about it. She said, I understand the doctors' position. I do not blame them. But as a patient, I see them leave and I think, what am I going to do now, and where does that leave me? I feel like I have lost control over how my pregnancy will go. Unfortunately, this is not just a story confined to this part of the world. This is a story of pregnant moms all over America who are wondering whether or not they are going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, one, I understand the problem and I intend to work with Congress to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of Texas, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. And there was two things wrong with that strategy. One is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the State that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from one area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from one area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your Federal budget spends $28 billion a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for Medicaid and Medicare and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to Congress with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, 100 percent of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. Seems to be fair, if you get hurt. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages. And in the case of truly egregious wrongdoing, patients should be entitled to punitive damages. But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, the State of California has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in 1975. Patients in that State see their claims settled a third faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since 1975, insurance premiums for California doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most States. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the Congress ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, Congress needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. I know you do. I know the people of this part of the world understand it, because you see firsthand what happens when the system gets out of control: 160 docs leave 2 counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on election day about medical liability. The House passed a good medical liability reform bill last year. I want to thank the two Members of Congress for working on it. The Senate failed to get the job done. Well, the new Congress is starting over, you know. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the American people. Both Houses will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the House to get the bill moving. It is important for the United States Senators from this State and other States to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in the year 2005. Junk lawsuits affect more than just the medical field. According to a recent study, frivolous litigation has helped drive the total cost of our tort system to more than $230 billion a year. That is the equivalent of $3,200 for every family of four. The lawsuit burden falls especially hard on small businesses. And yet small businesses are the engine of job are the engines of job creation in our country. Seventy percent of all new jobs in America are created by small businesses. The tort costs in America are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. Think about that. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for American manufacturers and entrepreneurs. And so here are some actions Congress can take as well. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in Madison County. The number of class actions filed here increased by over 5,000 percent between 1998 and 2003, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from Madison County. Think about that. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed . I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the Congress this year. I will also work with Congress to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern Illinois and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of dozens of companies and cost tens of thousands of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. More than 100,000 new asbestos claims were filed last year alone. Congress has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. They need to act and get the job done. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in 2005. I think we are sent to Washington to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Congresses. I believe we are called to do the hard work to make our communities and quality of life a better place. And it is hard work for some in Congress to stand up to the trial lawyers. I understand that. But all we are asking for is fairness. We want our doctors treated fairly. We want the hospitals treated fairly. And most of all, we want the patients and the American people treated fairly. And I appreciate you all giving me a chance to come by and talk about the vital issue of legal reform. I intend to go back to Washington here shortly, and when I see Members of the Congress as I work this issue, I am going to say, I spoke to the good folks of southern Illinois. They understand the problem, and they expect you, Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, to get the job done. Thanks for coming by to say hello. I hope you and your families have a blessed and healthy 2005. May God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 746, "text": "I am very grateful to have this second .major meeting on how we can save energy in our Nation by the concerted effort of leaders like yourselves and those who are eager, I believe, as patriotic citizens to increase our Nation's security through reducing our dependence, unwarranted and excessive dependence, on imported oil. Today we have formed a council for energy efficiency, and we have the panel members here, the award winners, whom we will recognize in a few minutes, and community leaders, and I want to thank all of you for being present. As you know, millions of our citizens now recognize vividly, as they did not perhaps just 12 months ago, how vital it is for each one of us to join in reducing imports. There are only two ways to do it, as I have said many times: one is to eliminate the waste of energy, which has never been an integral part of Americans' lives; and secondly, to produce more energy ourselves. The cheapest, most efficient approach between those two, obviously, is to reduce our own consumption of energy, which I believe we can do, as has been proved by many of you already, without reducing the quality of our own lives. For the past 3 1/2 years I and many of you here, all the members of my own administration, almost every Member of the Congress, has fought for and has finally achieved the basic framework of a comprehensive energy policy for our country, something that we have never had before and something which is already paying rich dividends for us. We now import, the first half of this year, almost 15 percent less oil than we did the same 6 months in 1979. That is a remarkable achievement, particularly in view of the fact that in the years preceding this year we had had a steady upward trend in the amount of oil that we had bought from overseas. We have still not reached our goals. And as you know, by 1990 we have set as a goal for ourselves a slashing in half of the actual amount that we import and a reduction by more than two-thirds of the amount that we would have imported had we not put into effect these conservation measures. We have today, this day, imported about 1 1/2 million less barrels than we did an equivalent day 12 months ago. This is a very fine achievement, thanks to many of you. We have got to keep this progress going. We have still got much to do, and we have made good progress already. We have got two basic approaches, as you well know from the briefing you have had and from the discussion today. One is in the area of transportation, and we will recognize some that have achieved superior performance already. And we also are launching, with as effective a program as possible throughout our Nation, a means by which we conserve energy within individual homes. And we think that each home, on the average, can save 25 percent of the energy it has been consuming. This can be done through tax credits to encourage the weatherization of homes, the installation of devices like thermostats, that are timed by day, to prevent excessive air conditioning or heating loads when they are not needed, because somebody might be absent-minded and not change the thermostat when they could have changed it, and of course, the installation of solar heating devices of all kinds. We have received from the transportation industry about 190 different specific commitments derived from the previous meeting that we have had here. So, that is an achievement already. The homes will be the second achievement and a third one that we are working for is in the field of agriculture. I have been a farmer almost all my life, except when I have been in government service. All of my people before me for many generations have been full-time farmers, and I know from practical experience that, in my earlier days, we had much less dependence upon bought fuels for the heating or drying of crops and for cultivation and, as any farm agent knows and as any superior farmer knows, minimum tillage can be an advantage and not a disadvantage. And the sun-drying of our crops, instead of using imported oil or natural gas or butane, can be a very efficient way to do an equally superior job. We anticipate that if the farmers can save only 5 percent of the energy they use compared to a year ago and if homeowners can reduce, by an amount that I have already described, that we can cut our oil imports at a $32 per barrel price by roughly $20 billion each year. We have, finally, a need to expand the public awareness of what can be done. A lot of people have feared energy conservation because it is new to them, and they have assumed, incorrectly, that to save energy in their own lives, in their homes, on their farms, in their businesses, in their transportation, would cause them to lead an inferior quality of life compared to what they had been using, to which they had been accustomed. This is not the fact. I think that this can be the means by which safety can be enhanced with strict enforcement of driver habits, speed limits, more efficient automobiles, more efficient homes, more attention to sharing rides, the location of buildings in a proper fashion, and the orientation in business of a much more efficient operation with the production of goods with a minimum amount of energy expended. In closing, let me say that we shared this kind of discussion in Venice, recently, among the leaders of the seven major democratic industrialized nations. This is not a unique problem with America. As a matter of fact, of all the nations represented there, ours perhaps is the most blessed with the broadest range of energy availability. France, Italy, Japan, in particular, are heavily dependent on imported fuels. Great Britain, with the North Sea deposits, has now become relatively self-sufficient. Of course, we know that Canada has certain forms of energy, not nearly so much and so diverse as do we. But all of the nations are now moving toward a more careful approach to the consumption of energy. I'd like to ask Neil Goldschmidt now to come forward to give the awards for outstanding energy efficiency in the transportation sector, and later on, in a subsequent ceremony, after the contests and the competition has been observed and analyzed, we will have similar awards made for conservation in homes and on the farms. And we will be asking all those who are directly involved, including farm co-ops, the TVA, major utility companies, to participate in special ways to inform their customers and their members about what they can indeed do in their own homes and on their own farms to enhance the conservation of energy in our Nation. This is important to the well-being of our people; it is important to the security of our country. And I am deeply grateful for the partnership that you have formed with us in this worthwhile pursuit.

{"id": 757, "text": "Well, good afternoon, everybody. I want to thank Chairman Dempsey for bringing us here together to review coalition operations to degrade and to ultimately destroy ISIL. I want to thank General Austin of Central Command and General Votel, down at the end, of Special Operations Command for their outstanding leadership as well. At this stage, some 60 nations are contributing to this coalition, including more than 20 coalition members who are represented here today, among them, Iraq, Arab nations, Turkey, NATO allies, and partners from around the world. So this is an operation that involves the world against ISIL. So far, we have seen some important successes: stopping ISIL's advance on Erbil, saving many civilians from a massacre on Mount Sinjar, retaking the Mosul Dam, destroying ISIL targets and fighters across Iraq and Syria. Obviously, at this point, we are also focused on the fighting that is taking place in Iraq's Anbar Province, and we are deeply concerned about the situation in and around the Syrian town of Kobani, which underscores the threat that ISIL poses in both Iraq and Syria. And coalition airstrikes will continue in both these areas. One of the things that has emerged from the discussions, both before I came and during my visit here, is that this is going to be a long-term campaign. There are not quick fixes involved. We are still at the early stages. As with any military effort, there will be days of progress, and there are going to be periods of setback. But our coalition is united behind this long-term effort. Our nations agree that ISIL poses a significant threat to the people of Iraq and Syria. It poses a threat to surrounding countries. And because of the numbers of foreign fighters that are being attracted and the chaos that ISIL was creating in the region, ultimately, it will pose a threat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States, Europe, and far-flung countries like Australia that have already seen terrorist networks trying to infiltrate and impact population centers on the other side of the world. So we are united in our goal to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL so that it is no longer a threat to Iraq, to the region, or the international community. But one of the things that is also been emphasized here today is, this is not simply a military campaign. This is not a classic army in which we defeat them on the battlefield and then they ultimately surrender. What we are also fighting is an ideological strain of extremism that has taken root in too many parts of the region. We are dealing with sectarianism and political divisions that for too long have been a primary political, organizational rallying point in the region. We are dealing with economic deprivation and lack of opportunity among too many young people in the region. And so one of the interesting things to hear from our military leadership is the recognition that this cannot simply be a military campaign. This has to be a campaign that includes all the dimensions of our power. We have to do a better job communicating an alternative vision for those who are currently attracted to the fighting inside Iraq and Syria. It is going to be absolutely critical to make sure that the political inclusion that Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq is committed to is actually translated into real progress. It is going to require us developing and strengthening a moderate opposition inside of Syria that is in a position then to bring about the kind of legitimacy and sound governance for all people inside of Syria. And so, in addition to denying ISIL safe haven in Iraq and Syria, in addition to stopping foreign fighters, in addition to the intelligence gathering and airstrikes and ground campaigns that may be developed by the Iraqi security forces, we are also going to have to pay attention to communications. We are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer. And we are going to have to continue to deliver on the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected. And we have three countries here Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey who obviously are bearing an extraordinary burden from the displaced persons, not just recently over the last few months, but for several years now as a consequence of the civil war in Syria. That all plays a part in this campaign. But I want to thank all the nations who are represented here in what is a growing coalition. I am encouraged by the unanimity of viewpoints and the commitment of the countries involved to make sure that we are making steady progress. Before I close, I do want to say something about another topic that is obviously attracted a lot of attention, and that is the situation with Ebola. We have made enormous strides in just a few short weeks in standing up a U.S. military operation in western Africa that can start building the kind of transport lines and supply lines to get workers, supplies, medicine, equipment into Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. And a number of the countries who are represented here are really stepping up and doing what is necessary in order for us to contain this epidemic. But as I have said before and I am going to keep on repeating until we start seeing more progress, the world as a whole is not doing enough. There are a number of countries that have capacity that have not yet stepped up. Those that have stepped up, all of us are going to have to do more, because unless we contain this at the source, this is going to continue to pose a threat to individual countries at a time when there is no place that is more than a couple of air flights away. And the transmission of this disease obviously directly threatens all our populations. In addition, we have not only a humanitarian crisis in West Africa that threatens hundreds of thousands of lives, but we also have the secondary effects of destabilization, economically and politically, that could lead to more severe problems down the road. So everybody is going to have to do more than they are doing right now. And I am reaching out directly to heads of state and government who, I believe, have the capacities to do more. I spoke yesterday with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who agrees that everybody has to do more. And I can assure everybody that the United States will continue to do its part. With respect to Ebola here in the United States, we are surging resources into Dallas to examine what exactly has happened that ended up infecting the nurse there. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with her and all the courageous health care workers around the country who put themselves in challenging situations in treating this disease. We are going to make sure that all the lessons learned from Dallas are then applied to hospitals and health centers around the country. As I have said before, we have a public health infrastructure and systems and support that make an epidemic here highly unlikely. But obviously, one case is too many, and we have got to keep on doing everything we can, particularly to protect our health care workers, because they are on the front lines in battling this disease. And we have also now instituted some additional screening measures, starting at JFK Airport, that will then apply to a number of other airports where we know the bulk of travelers that may have come in contact with Ebola would be coming through. We are confident that we are going to be able to put those in place in the days ahead. But in the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with the nurse, who, like so many nurses and health care workers around the country, day in, day out, do what they need to do, sometimes at some risk to themselves, in order to provide the kind of care that we all depend on. We need to eliminate those risks for them, and we are confident that we can build the protocols and make sure that they are observed carefully to avoid additional repeats of what is happened in Dallas. But we are going to be as vigilant as we need to be in order to make sure that this disease is properly contained. The best way for us to do that, though, is also to make sure and understand that what happens in West Africa has an impact here in the United States and in all the other countries that are represented here. So thank you very much, everybody.

{"id": 676, "text": "Well, I just want to welcome the Amir of Qatar and thank him and the people of his country for the friendship that they have shown towards the United States. There is an excellent relationship between the United States and Qatar on a whole range of levels : with respect to security, with respect to our military cooperation, our commerce and our trade. Qatar has been a center of innovation. We have seen enormous progress within the country on everything ranging from education to health care. And I think His Highness has shown extraordinary leadership over the last many years in helping to guide his country. Obviously, Qatar is also an important country in the region and has an influence that extends beyond its relatively small population. And so we had an opportunity to discuss a whole range of issues that directly relate to U.S. interests and U.S. security, but more importantly, the security of the entire world. We had a conversation about the situation in Syria. And obviously, we have been cooperating closely with Qatar and other countries in seeking to bring about an end to the slaughter that is taking place there-the removal of President Assad, who has shown himself to have no regard for his own people-and to strengthen an opposition that can bring about a democratic Syria that represents all people and respects their rights regardless of their ethnicity or their religious affiliations. And I am very pleased that we are going to be continuing to work in the coming months to try to further support the Syrian opposition, and we will be closely coordinating our strategies to bring about a more peaceful resolution to the Syrian crisis. We also had an opportunity to discuss the situation in Egypt, where we both very much want to see success on the part of Egyptian democracy. And both of our countries are committed to trying to encourage not only progress in this new democracy, but also economic progress that can translate into actual prosperity for the people there. We had an opportunity to discuss the situation with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we both agree that peace is in the interests of everyone: a secure Israel side-by-side with a sovereign Palestinian state. And we exchanged ideas about how we can advance those negotiations, and I have shared the importance of providing support to President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority so that they can be in position to have fruitful negotiations with the Israelis that can bring about, in a timely fashion, a two-state solution. And I had an opportunity to thank the Amir for the strong support that his country has provided to our efforts in Afghanistan, including the efforts that he has personally been involved with in getting a dialogue between the Afghan Government and the Taliban that might potentially result in some sort of political reconciliation. These are all very difficult issues, and neither of us are under any illusions that they will be solved overnight. But what we agree with is that if our two countries are communicating frankly and constructively and pursuing common strategies, that we can be a force for good for the entire region and for a vision of the Middle East that is democratic, that is prosperous, that is tolerant, that is representative of all peoples, and that is a force for good around the world. And so I want to thank the Amir for this visit and for his friendship. And I look forward to working with him and the Government of Qatar for many years to come.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithamirhamadbinkhalifaalthaniqatar0", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Amir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-amir-hamad-bin-khalifa-al-thani-qatar-0", "publication_date": "23-04-2013", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 767, "text": "Thanks for coming to the White House on Champions Day, the day we honor our Nation's champs. I first want to say that, obviously, you know how to play hoops in the East as our Texas teams found out. And it seems like Minnesota is pretty good at hockey too. I now know why we have got all these Senators from New York and Minnesota and Connecticut, as well as Members of the House from those three States. Welcome, and thank you all for honoring these fine student athletes. We are glad you are here. I want to welcome the University of Connecticut women's basketball team back to the White House. Geno told me last time that-last time I greeted them here- that they would be back. He really did not say it that way; we will play like he said it that way-makes a better story. At any rate, congratulations to you all. I appreciate Jeffrey Hathaway coming as well. These ladies can flat play basketball, and they are a great credit to women's athletics and to sport. They will probably be back next year too. We are really glad you are here, and I am glad Diana has given me the jersey. She is-thank God I do not have to guard her. I also want to welcome the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities men's hockey team back here again as well. I appreciate Don Lucia. I want to thank the athletic director, Joel Maturi, as well for coming. It is good to see these men back. They also know how to play hockey really well. They told me they'd be back again next year. Senator Dayton was a heck of a goalie in his day, but I do not know if he could stop these guys or not. I know the State of Minnesota is proud of your accomplishments. We are really glad you are here. And we are also glad that the ladies' hockey team from the University of Minnesota-Duluth is here. It is good to see Dr. Martin. Thank you for coming back-as well as Shannon Miller. She is been the coach for 4 years and has won three national championships. It sounds like to me, Dr. Martin, you'd better give her a raise. It is a State issue, of course. But congratulations to you all. I also want to congratulate Syracuse for winning their first national championship. It is a great tribute to Jim Boeheim, who is a heck of a guy and a great leader of men. Congratulations, Coach. I know you have worked hard for this. If it was not the University of Texas, I am glad it was you. You have got some great players on your team. I am sure some of us are going to be asking Carmelo Anthony for a loan one of these days-- so keep the interest rates low. But congratulations on winning a tough tournament. You are a great credit to the sport. I also want to welcome Mike Tirico, who is here. Where are you, Mike? Oh, there you are. Congratulations on being a Syracuse grad. I know you were objective in your analysis of the of the tournament. But thanks for coming. I-one of the things I really appreciate about these days is that, when you welcome these champs, is that it reminds people of the basics of life, the need to serve something greater than yourself in life. Championship teams do not win because of a star. Championship teams win because people are willing to work together for a greater good, in this case, the team. Championship teams win because people are willing to work hard and sacrifice for something important. These are values that are really important not only in sport but in life as well. The other thing that is important about a championship team is to-for people to understand that you can be a champ on the court or on the ice as well as off the court and off the ice. I have asked Dr. Martin if she remembered what I said last year about people serving their communities in which they live. She said, You bet. We have got girls on our team who are mentoring. One girl said she works for the Boys and Girls Club. My call to the champs is to be a champ off the playing-when you are not playing as well. You have got a chance to make a difference in somebody's life. There is always some little kid draped over the- draped over the ice, looking at the star Minnesota players, wondering what it is like to be a star. And a star is somebody who sets a good example. A star is somebody who says, I have got some God-given talents, and I want to help somebody else utilize his or her talents so they can realize the American Dream. There is always some little guy hanging around or some girl hanging around courtside watching champs, watching behavior. And you have a chance as champions to set such a good example for America's young, so that the next generation of athletes will know what it means to be a champ on the court or on the rink as well as off the court and off the rink. And so I am here today to congratulate you for setting such a good example. Now that the spotlight is on you, assume responsibility. Do your job as an American. Love somebody just like you'd like to be loved yourself, and America will be a better place for it. Welcome to the White House. May God bless your talents, and may God continue to bless our great country. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshonoringncaawinterchampionteams", "title": "Remarks Honoring NCAA Winter Champion Teams", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-ncaa-winter-champion-teams", "publication_date": "17-06-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 868, "text": "Well, one of the great pleasures of this job, but also one of my responsibilities, is making sure that we are preserving our Nation's treasures so that they can be enjoyed by our children, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. And over the years, over a hundred sites have been set aside as national monuments, everything from the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon. So today I am continuing that proud tradition by adding another monument to the list. Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia, has played a remarkable role in the history of our Nation. It was the site of the first slave ships to land in the New World. But during the Civil War, almost 250 years later, Fort Monroe also became a refuge for slaves that were escaping from the South and helped create the environment in which Abraham Lincoln was able to sign that document up there, the Emancipation Proclamation. In September, Fort Monroe closed its doors as a military base. But thanks to the advocacy of some outstanding citizens and historians and elected officials who are represented here, as well as the great work of our Department of the Interior and Ken Salazar and the all the people who have been involved in making this day possible, we are going to continue this legacy, making Fort Monroe a national monument. This is going to give an opportunity for people from all across the country to travel to Fort Monroe and trace the history that has been so important to making America what it is. It is also going to be an incredibly important economic boost to the region. Local officials estimate that this may end up creating as many as 3,000 jobs in the region. It will add millions of dollars to the local economy in and around Hampton. And so this is a win-win. Not only is it good for the people of that region now, but it also allows us to set aside this incredibly important site for the enjoyment and appreciation of generations to come. So I want to thank everybody who is here for the great work that they have done. I am looking forward to not only visiting myself, but also taking Malia and Sasha down there so they get a little bit a sense of their history. And I thank the Commonwealth of Virginia for giving us this opportunity to appreciate the remarkable history of their State, but also of this country. So with that, I am going to sign this bill or Executive order. There you go. Thank you so much. Just one last point I want to make. As I said, there is a strong economic component to this. We think we can see additional jobs in Virginia as a consequence of this. But for those Members of Congress who are here, I still need some action from Congress on the American Jobs Act and other steps. But in the meantime, this is going to make a big difference. And again, I want to thank everybody here, particularly the private citizens who put their time and money and effort into making this day possible. All right? Thank you, everybody. Ms. Rodham was a remarkable person. Anybody who knows her history knows what a strong, determined, and gifted person she was. For her to have been able to live the life that she did and to see her daughter succeed at the pinnacle of public service in this country, I am sure was deeply satisfying to her. My thoughts, Michelle's thoughts, the entire White House's thoughts go out to the entire Clinton family. And I know that she will be remembered as somebody who helped make a difference in this country and this world.

{"id": 561, "text": "The urgent needs of the American people require our presence here today. Our people demand legislative action by their Government to do two things: first, to check inflation and the rising cost of living, and second, to help in meeting the acute housing shortage. These are matters which affect every American family. They also affect the entire world, for world peace depends upon the strength of our economy. The Communists, both here and abroad, are counting on our present prosperity turning into a depression. They do not believe that we can--or will--put the brake on high prices. They are counting on economic collapse in this country. If we should bring on another great depression in the United States by failing to control high prices, the world's hope for lasting peace would vanish. A depression in the United States would cut the ground from under the free nations of Europe. Economic collapse in this country would prevent the recovery throughout the world which is essential to lasting peace. We would have only ourselves to blame for the tragedy that would follow. In these tense days, when our strength is being taxed all over the world, it would be reckless folly if we failed to act against inflation. High prices are not taking time off for the election. High prices are not waiting until the next session of Congress. High prices are getting worse. They are getting worse every day. We cannot afford to wait for the next Congress to act. The 81st Congress will not get under way for nearly 6 months. Before the new Congress could take action against high prices, it would have to draft new bills, study them, hold hearings, debate and decide whether to pass them. It would be at least 8 months from now before the new Congress could pass the laws we need. Eight months more of inflation would be much too long. It was 8 months ago--November 1947--that I called a special session of this Congress, and recommended a comprehensive anti-inflation program. But that program was not enacted. If it had been enacted, we would have lower prices today. Since last November, prices have gone even higher. As every housewife knows, food prices rose rapidly throughout 1947. They are climbing even faster now. Month after month, the cost of clothing, fuel, and rent keeps on going up. The cost of living is now higher than ever before in our history. There are not many very rich men in the Congress of the United States. You all-most of you--have to live on your salaries. All you need do is just go home and ask your wife how living costs are now, as compared to what they were January 1st, 1947. We cannot risk the danger, or suffer the hardship, of another 8 months of doing nothing about high prices. Prices are already so high that last year more than one-fourth of the families of this country were forced to spend more than they earned. Families of low or moderate income are being priced out of the market for many of the necessities of life. They are not able to buy as much as they could buy 2 years ago, and they are paying a lot more for what they can buy. At the same time, industrial prices, which affect all business and employment, are rising, and rising fast. Large price increases have recently been announced by industries that set the pace for the whole economy. Just within the last few days, the steel industry, for example, increased its prices, on the average, by more than $9 a ton. The rise in industrial prices is just as important, in the long run, as the high cost of living. It is already squeezing the independent businessman. It threatens to destroy a fair balance between industry and agriculture. It can end only in catastrophe if it is allowed to continue. In the face of these facts, it is foolish to point at every feeble straw as a sign that the danger is disappearing. In February, some people said that the break in commodity prices meant that inflation was almost over. They were wrong. Prices rose again. There are still some people who repeat the old argument which was used by those who killed price control 2 years ago. They said that if we would only take controls off, production would increase, prices would go down, and there would be more for everybody at lower cost. The record shows unmistakably that this argument was false. Production has increased somewhat, and we want it to increase still more. But even with full employment, full use of available materials, and practically full use of plant capacity--all of which we have today--prices are still climbing much faster than production. It is obvious that we cannot rely solely on more production to curb high prices. Instead, we must attack inflation directly. If we do not stop inflation, production and employment will both fall sharply when the break comes. Positive action by this Government is long over-due. It must be taken now. I therefore urge the Congress to take strong, positive action to control inflation. I have reexamined the anti-inflation program I proposed to the Congress 8 months ago. In its essentials that program is as sound now as it was then. It has been revised and strengthened in the light of changing circumstances. The program I now propose is as follows: First, I recommend that an excess profits tax be reestablished in order to provide a Treasury surplus and to provide a brake on inflation. Second, I recommend that consumer credit controls be restored in order to hold down inflationary credit. Third, I recommend that the Federal Reserve Board be given greater authority to regulate inflationary bank credit. Fourth, I recommend that authority be granted to regulate speculation on the commodity exchanges. Fifth, I recommend that authority be granted for allocation and inventory control of scarce commodities which basically affect essential industrial production, or the cost of living. Sixth, I recommend that rent controls be strengthened, and that adequate appropriations be provided for enforcement, in order to prevent further unwarranted rent increases. Seventh, I recommend that standby authority be granted to ration those few products in short supply which vitally affect the health and welfare of our people. On the basis of present facts, and unless further shortages occur, this authority might not have to be used. Eighth, I recommend that price control be authorized for scarce commodities which basically affect essential industrial production or the cost of living. I have said before, and I repeat, that many profit margins have been adequate to absorb wage increases without the price increases that have followed. Rising wages and rising standards of living, based on increasing productivity and a fair distribution of income, is the American way. Noninflationary wage increases can and should continue to be made by free collective bargaining. Where the Government imposes a price ceiling, wage adjustments which can be absorbed within the price ceiling should not be interfered with by the Government. The Government should have the authority, however, to limit wage adjustments which would force a break in the price ceiling, except where wage adjustments are essential to remedy hardship, to correct inequities, or to prevent an actual lowering of the living standards. The measures I have recommended make up a balanced program to attack high prices. They are all necessary to check rising prices and safeguard our economy against the danger of depression. If they are made the first order of business by the Congress, as they should be, they can be promptly enacted. Every week of delay will mean additional hardship for the American people. The second reason why I have called the Congress back is that our people need legislation now to help meet the national housing shortage. We desperately need more housing at lower prices--prices which families of moderate income, particularly veterans' families, can afford to pay. We are not getting it. Even more urgently, we need more rental housing--especially low-rent housing. We are not getting it. Most of the housing now being built is for sale, or for rent, at prices far above the reach of the average American family. I have recommended time and again that the Congress pass a comprehensive housing bill which would help us obtain more housing at lower prices--both for sale and for rent. A good housing bill, Senate Bill 866, known as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill, passed the Senate on April 22. This bill would provide aid to cities in clearing slums and in building low-rent housing projects. It would give extensive aid to the private home building industry. It includes provisions for farm housing, and for research to bring down building costs. It contains many other provisions, all aimed at getting more housing at lower prices and at lower rents. This is the bill we need. We need it now, not a year from now. If this legislation is passed this summer, it will be possible to start immediately the production of more houses of the kind our families need, and at prices they can afford to pay. If it is not passed now, the 81st Congress will have to start all over again with a new housing bill. In that case, we might lose a full year in meeting our national housing need. This Congress can complete action on this comprehensive housing bill in a few days. And I strongly urge that it do so. I have called the Congress back primarily to deal with high prices and with the housing shortage. Delay on either of these items would be most dangerous. In addition, there are other important legislative measures on which delay would injure us at home and impair our world relations. I therefore recommend that the present session, without allowing anything to interfere with its vital work on legislation concerning high prices and housing, take action on certain other important measures. These measures can speedily be enacted now because of the amount of study already given to them by the Congress. First, the Congress should provide Federal assistance to the States in meeting the present crisis in education. The children in our schools, and the men and women who teach there, have been made the victims of inflation. More children are entering school than ever before. But inflation has cut down the purchasing power of the money devoted to educational purposes. Teachers' salaries, for the most part, have lagged far behind the increased cost of living. The overcrowding of our schools is seriously detrimental to the health and the education of our boys and girls. Every month that we delay in meeting this problem will cause damage that can never be repaired. Several million children of school age are unable to attend school, largely because of lack of facilities or teachers. To meet these vital educational needs, the Congress should complete action on Senate Bill 472, which passed the Senate on April the 1st. All that remains to be done is its passage by the House of Representatives. Prompt action by the Congress is also needed to help another group of our people who are suffering from inflation. These are the workers who depend on the protection of the minimum wage law. The present minimum wage law is pitifully inadequate in the face of today's high prices. Proposals to raise minimum wages have long been before the Congress. I urgently recommend that the minimum wage be raised to at least 75 cents an hour at this session. Senate Bill 2062 and its companion House bills would be suitable measures for this purpose. I also urge that action be taken by the Congress to relieve other victims of inflation. These are the people who depend upon the benefits being paid under the old-age and survivors insurance system. The average old-age retirement benefit for a man and his wife is only $39 a month. For a widow with two children, the average monthly benefit is only $49. These benefits are utterly inadequate. I urge that they be increased by at least 50 percent and that the age at which women can receive benefits be lowered from 65 to 60 years. I also hope that the protection of this system will be extended to the millions who are not now covered. In our relations with the rest of the world, action is also needed at once, and can be taken quickly, to afford additional proof that we mean what we say when we talk about freedom, humanity, and international cooperation for peace and prosperity. Three measures are involved. First, the Displaced Persons Act in its present form discriminates unfairly against some displaced persons because of their religion, land of origin, or occupation. These provisions are contrary to all American ideals. This act should be promptly amended to wipe out these discriminations. Furthermore, the present act permits the entry of only 200,000 persons, and charges them against future immigration quotas. I believe strongly that this act should provide for the entry of 400,000 persons over a 4-year period, and they should be outside the normal immigration quotas. The act can and should be amended promptly. Second, many people in the world must wonder how strongly we support the United Nations when we hesitate to assist the construction of its permanent home in this country. Legislation can and should be passed at once to authorize a loan by the United States Government to the United Nations, for the construction of its headquarters buildings in New York City. The International Wheat Agreement is another vital measure on which the Congress should act. This agreement is designed to insure stability in the world wheat market in the years ahead when wheat will be more plentiful. It would guarantee American farmers an export market of 185 million bushels of wheat at a fair price during each of the next 5 years. Since the agreement is in the form of a treaty it requires only ratification by the Senate. Although this agreement should have been ratified by July 1st of this year, we have good reason to believe that it can still be made effective if it is now ratified promptly. Also, I wish to call the attention of the Congress to three other problems on which action can and should be taken at this session. The Congress should reconsider its recent actions which cut sharply into our national electric power policy. There is an acute shortage of electric power in this country now. I am therefore re-submitting to the Congress appropriation requests for certain power projects which must be provided right away. These requests include the TVA steamplant at New Johnsonville, Tenn., and certain other projects on which congressional reductions, if allowed to stand, will delay the production of power for a year or more. These appropriations should be promptly enacted, and at the same time certain crippling limitations should be removed from the law. In the final days before adjourning in June, the Congress passed a bill raising the salaries of some Federal employees. However, this bill neglected long overdue reforms in the Federal pay scales and discriminated unfairly against certain groups of employees. The Congress should take this opportunity to enact more equitable and realistic Federal pay legislation. Finally, I again urge upon the Congress the measures I recommended last February to protect and extend basic civil rights of citizenship and human liberty. A number of bills to carry out my recommendations have been introduced in the Congress. Many of them have already received careful consideration by congressional committees. Only one bill, however, has been enacted, a bill relating to the rights of Americans of Japanese origin. I believe that it is necessary to enact the laws I have recommended in order to make the guarantees of the Constitution real and vital. I believe they are necessary to carry out our American ideals of liberty and justice for all. I hope that there is no misunderstanding of the recommendations I have made. have asked the Congress to return, first of all, in order to meet the urgent need of our people for relief from high prices and the housing shortage. I urge the Congress not to be distracted from these central purposes. At the same time, as I have stated, the Congress can and should act on certain other important items of legislation at this special session. There are still other problems of great moment which vitally affect the welfare of the Nation. I have discussed them in previous messages to this Congress. I have made recommendations for legislation to meet them. I do not repeat them now--because the purposes and limited time of this special session do not readily permit action on them. However, I feel just as strongly as ever that all these measures are necessary. If the Congress finds time to enact any of them now the country will greatly benefit. Certainly, the next Congress should take them up immediately. These include: a comprehensive health program, based on health insurance; a fair and sound labor-management relations law-in place of the Taft-Hartley law which has proved to be unfair and unsound and which should be repealed; a real long-range farm program; a stronger reciprocal trade agreements act; a universal training program; a national science foundation; strengthened antitrust laws; and the approval of the St. Lawrence waterway treaty. The vigor of our democracy is judged by its ability to take decisive actions--actions which are necessary to maintain our physical and moral strength and to raise our standards of living. In these days of continued stress, the test of that vigor becomes more and more difficult. The legislative and executive branches of our Government can meet that test today. The American people rightfully expect us to meet it together. I hope that the American people will not look to us in vain.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsmessagethespecialsessionthe80thcongress", "title": "Message to the Special Session of the 80th Congress", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/message-the-special-session-the-80th-congress", "publication_date": "27-07-1948", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

{"id": 985, "text": "Thanks for the warm welcome. I do not know about you, but I am excited about the year 2008. I intend to finish strong with my head held high. And I intend to work to see to it that we keep the White House and elect John Boehner Speaker of the House of Representatives. And evidently, you feel the same way. Now, I thank you all for coming tonight. I am really pleased that this event has turned out to be as successful as it has been. I send I bring greetings from First Lady Laura Bush. She is yes, thank you. She is doing great. She is wedding planning right now, so I appreciate the invitation to be here. You know, I was just thinking about how next year's dinner is going to be a little different from this one. First, you are going to be welcoming a new keynote speaker, President John McCain. And President McCain will start this dinner by saying, Thanks for the introduction, Mr. Speaker. And I will be watching it all on TV in Crawford. I do want to thank my friend John Boehner. He has been a great leader for the Republicans in the House of Representatives. He is a good, solid, strategic thinker. I am proud to call him friend, and I thank you for your service. I want to thank the House leaders who are here: Roy Blunt, Adam Putnam, Darrell Issa. Issa, you did a heck of a job tonight. Thank you for doing this. I want to recognize my friend Tom Cole. Tom Cole has the vision and determination to effect change, and that is, elect Republicans to be the Speaker and leaders of the House of Representatives. I appreciate you coming, Tommy. I want to thank Eric Cantor, David Dreier, Kay Granger, John Carter. I appreciate Sam * Hall, my fellow Texan, and Sam Johnson, my fellow Texan, and Ralph Regula for presenting the awards on all the veterans who are serving in Congress tonight. That'll happen after I leave, but nevertheless, I do want to extend my congratulations. I thank Trace Adkins for singing here tonight. Trace wondered whether I was going to sing. I told him, no, I did not think I'd sing; I thought I'd just do a little tap-dance. And I also appreciate my friend, one of the great voices of all time, Sam Moore. Thank you, Sam, for being here. I also want to welcome all the candidates who are running for office. You know, it is not an easy decision to make to run for the United States Congress, but it is a noble decision. And it is a tough decision for your families. And so I want to thank you for agreeing to run; I want to thank your families for agreeing to support you. My advice is, work hard, talk about what is in your heart, let the people know your values, and win. And I think you will. I think 2008 is going to be a fabulous year for the Republican Party. And the reason why I believe that is because when the American people look at our ideals versus the ideals of the Democrats, when they look at what we believe versus what they believe, they are with us. We represent the values of the American people. Our ideas are the ones embraced by the folks. They may not be the ones that the pundits listen to, but they are the ones who are out working every single day to make America a great and hopeful place. We believe in strong national defense, and we will do what it takes to keep our Nation safe from a terrorist attack. We believe in limited government. We believe in the collective wisdom of the American people to make the decisions on behalf of the American Government. We would rather trust you than the people in government to make the decisions for what is best for you. I am optimistic about this year because I know John McCain. I have known him for many years. I have seen his character and his leadership up close. I have campaigned with him, and I have campaigned against him. And I can tell you this: He is a tough competitor. I have seen in every decision he makes that he is guided by the national interests of the United States, not by self-interest. I know John McCain to be a man who will make decisions based upon sound principles, not based upon the latest focus group or political poll. John McCain is running on a clear, consistent, and conservative agenda. He is a man of honor. He is a genuine hero. He has the wisdom and the experience necessary to be the Commander in Chief of our United States military forces. He loves this country. He is ready to lead this country. I am proud to be his friend. I am proud to be his supporter. And on Inauguration Day, I will proud to be say to John McCain, Congratulations, Mr. President. And I can assure you he does not want a lonely victory. He needs allies in the Congress to help enact his agenda. And he is going to work hard alongside these candidates and the incumbents to make sure we win. He will be a great standard bearer. And I am confident I hope you go forth from this meeting with confidence because I am confident. I firmly believe that we can retake the House. I know we will hold the White House. And I know it is necessary for the United States of America that we do both. Let me talk about some of the issues and why I think we will win. We trust people. We Republicans believe you can make the best decisions for your life. On health care, we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. When it comes to education, we trust parents to make the right decisions for their children, and we believe in strong accountability in our public schools. We refuse to accept mediocrity. We refuse to accept the status quo when not every single child in America is learning to read and write and add and subtract. The American people need us because we will appoint judges who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench from which to write law, judges like John Roberts and Sam Alito. But I think the biggest issue in this campaign is going to be your taxes. I think the biggest issue in this campaign is which side of the political divide is going to let you keep your money and which side is going to raise your taxes. Now, we have got a record on which side will not raise your taxes. We have been through some tough economic times together. We have been through a recession and a terrorist attack and war and corporate scandal and natural disasters. And up until recently, this economy has been strong. We added jobs for 52 consecutive months. It is the longest uninterrupted job growth in the Nation's history. And the reason we did so in the face of these daunting challenges: We trusted the American people, and we cut taxes on every American who pays taxes. And we are fixing to do so again. We have hit a rough patch, but we took the lead. We anticipated the problems. And thanks to the leadership of John Boehner and Roy Blunt, they helped shepherd through over $160 billion of tax relief that will be reaching the mailboxes of the American people in the second week of May. Tax relief has worked in the past, and tax relief will work this time, when we get through this rough patch. Now, apparently, the other side thinks this is a bad thing, because they want to let the tax cuts expire. Let me be clear about this: Milk expires, taxes increase. And we know the difference. And so will the American people when they realize that 116 million households will see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800 if the Democrats get their way in the House of Representatives. Our message is this: We need a Republican President and a Republican Congress to prevent the Democrats from raising your taxes. We need to make the tax cuts permanent. There is no bigger issue than protecting our country from harm. It is the most solemn responsibility that those of us who have been honored to serve you have. We must do everything in our power to make sure the enemy does not strike us again. And I fully understood that after September the 11th, that the temptation would be to dismiss any threat; the temptation would be that, Oh, perhaps since we have not been attacked, the threat does not exist. Well, the threat does exist, and it requires steadfast, strong, clear-eyed leadership here in Washington, DC. One of the things that we must do is to make sure that the hundreds of people that are out working for you every night to protect you have the tools they need. If the enemy, if the extremists who want to do America harm, if the radicals who want to kill again, like they did before on our homeland, are making phone calls into the United States of America, we need to know who they are calling, what they are saying, and what they are planning. The Congress came together last year and passed the Protect America Act to give our professionals the tools they need. Unfortunately, that act expired. But the threat to the United States of America has not expired. Unfortunately, Democratic leaders in the House are continuing to block bipartisan legislation that would give our intelligence officials the tools they need to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications. And they are doing so despite the fact that legislation, good legislation, to give our professionals the tools passed the United States Senate by an overwhelming majority of 68 to 29. Instead of holding a vote on this bill that would pass the House of Representatives, House leaders have introduced a highly partisan and deeply flawed bill of their own. Their bill would put in place a cumbersome court approval process that would make it harder to collect intelligence on foreign terrorists and could reopen dangerous intelligence gaps that we experienced last year. Their bill fails to provide liability protection to companies believed to have assisted in protecting our Nation after the 9/11 attacks. Instead, the House bill would make matters worse by extending litigation for years to come. In fact, House leaders simply adopted the position that class-action trial lawyers are taking in billions of dollars of lawsuits they have filed. We are under threat, ladies and gentlemen, and yet the House leaders blocked meaningful, substantial legislation that will help protect America for the sake of class-action trial lawyers. Companies that may have helped us save lives should be thanked for their patriotic service and should not be subjected to billion-dollar lawsuits. This bill would require the disclosure of state secrets during the litigation process. This could lead to the public release of highly classified information that our enemies could use against us. The Democrat version of protecting America is a bad bill; it is irresponsible. It casts aside the bipartisan consensus that was reached in the United States Senate in favor of a partisan approach that has no chance of becoming law. House leaders know this, yet they are pursuing this anyway. This is bad public policy and another reason to elect Republicans to the House of Representatives. There is a lot of folks working to protect you at home. But the enemy only has to be right one time, and therefore, the best way to protect the American people from further harm is to defeat the enemy overseas so we do not have to face them here at home. And that is precisely the strategy that we are following. We are on the offense. Wherever we can find a terrorist who would harm the American people, we will bring him to justice. We are constantly pressing. And this war against the extremists is now being played out on two major theaters. First is Afghanistan. I laid out a doctrine that said, if you harbor a terrorist, you are equally as guilty as the terrorists. The Taliban and did not believe us, and so the United States of America, after giving the enemy due warning, unleashed the fury of a great military. And in so doing, we cleaned out the terrorist training camps from which they launched attacks on the United States and freed 25 million people from the clutches of a barbaric regime. This young democracy is struggling for its very existence against coldblooded killers, and it is in the interests of the United States that we stand strongly with these proud Afghan citizens, that we back them in their efforts, and that we make sure Al Qaida or any other extremist can no longer find a safe haven in the country of Afghanistan. And then, of course, the other theater is Iraq. Removing Saddam Hussein was the right decision early in my Presidency; it is the right decision now; and it will be the right decision ever. And the fight's been tough in Iraq. And for those of you here who are here who have served in that theater, I cannot thank you enough for your sacrifices and your service to the United States of America. There have been amazing gains made in that country. After all, they wrote one of the most modern constitutions in the history of the Middle East. Iraqis braved the violence to vote. And yet nearly a year ago, the terrorists and extremists were succeeding in their efforts to plunge the country into chaos. So I had a tough decision to make. I reviewed our strategy. I fully understood that failure in Iraq would make America more vulnerable to attack, that failure in Iraq would create unbelievable chaos in a part of the world that has that produced suicide bombers in the first place. And so rather than retreating, I made the considered judgment to send reinforcements into the country, in a dramatic move that is now called the surge. Fourteen months after I ordered the surge of forces, sectarian killings are down, and Al Qaida is on the defense. U.S. and Iraqi forces have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida operatives. Progress in Iraq is fragile, and there is no question, it is going to take strong determination to prevail. Yet even the enemy recognizes they are on the wrong side of events. They are disheartened, they are demoralized, and they will be defeated. When things were going poorly in Iraq early last year, Democrats called for withdrawal. Today, the situation has turned around, and Democrats are calling for withdrawal. It seems that no matter what happens on the ground, the opponents of the war have only one answer: retreat. You might even say that when it comes to withdrawing from Iraq, the Democrats' policy is, stay the course. If we followed their advice a year ago, Iraq would be far different and a much more dangerous place than it is today, and the American people would be at greater risk. And if we followed their advice now, we would put at risk all the gains our troops have made over the past year. The United States Congress does need to act when it comes to Iraq, and they need to stand with our brave men and women in uniform and give them all the resources they need to do their job. And it when it comes to standing with the United States military, there is no greater supporters than the Republicans in the House of Representatives. The struggle we are engaged in is difficult for the American some Americans to really understand the scope and the nature of the battle. We are involved in an ideological struggle between folks who murder the innocent to achieve political objectives, folks who have got a vision about what they would like to impose on the rest of the world, and particularly in the Middle East, and those of us who believe strongly in the power of liberty. I believe in the trans-formative power of liberty. I believe that if the United States of America does not lose its faith in the power of freedom to transform hopeless societies, that we will see the peace that we all want. I believe in the universality of freedom. I believe there is an Almighty, and I believe a gift of that Almighty to every man, woman, and child is freedom. I love to share the story, and I am sure some of you have heard this before but the story about my friendship with Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan. He is the guy that we went down to Elvis's place in Memphis with. He is a good pal. He is no longer in power, but when he was in office, right after the attacks of September the 11th, he clearly saw the dangers and the opportunities. He saw the dangers that hopelessness was the only way that these ideologues could recruit suicide bombers. And he knew that the United States of America and our allies must be firm in our resolve to bring the terrorists to justice and, at the same time, spread the blessings of liberty. And what is interesting about this story is that he was the leader of a country that my father fought against some 60 years prior. Think about that. Eighteen-year-old Navy Ensign George H.W. Bush, like many of your relatives, signed up to fight the Japanese. As a matter of fact, the war was so bitter that our vocabulary had slur words in it about the Japanese for years after the war ended. They were the hated enemy. And yet 60 years later, his son, the son of a Navy fighter pilot, was at the table talking with the Prime Minister of the former enemy about the peace. Something amazing took place. And what happened was, Japan adopted democracy, a system of government with liberty at its core. My friends, freedom is transformative. Freedom can transform an enemy into an ally. And someday, an American President will be thanking this Congress for its steadfast support of liberty, because he will be sitting down at the table talking about keeping the peace for generations to come, and our children and our grandchildren will be better off for it. I thank you for coming. I thank you for your prayers.

{"id": 553, "text": "Thanks so much. Well, good morning. Let me start by thanking Michael for his work and for that kind introduction. And I want to also thank Dawn Sweeny and everyone at the National Restaurant Association for having me here. It is a pleasure for me to be with you all. So today I am going to talk about food, which is something that all of you here today know a little bit about. Together, you represent 40 percent of the nearly one million restaurants in the United States, from the biggest chains to the smallest diners. You know what Americans like to eat and what they do not . You have seen how the ingredients we put in our bodies affect the way we feel and the way we feel about ourselves. And you also understand the unique role that food, and restaurants especially, play in our own lives and in the life of our nation. Restaurants have always been places to celebrate a special occasion or mark an important milestone, to bond with new friends and grow closer as a family. They provide a service to our communities unlike any other. And even as tastes and customs have changed over time, restaurants remain an incredibly dynamic part of our American story. And today, one out of every two dollars spent on food in this country goes towards meals outside the home -- and that is double what it was just 50 years ago. And one-third of all meals today are eaten in restaurants. So it is clear that eating out has become part of our American way of life. And while restaurants are still places where we go to mark a special occasion -- to celebrate a good report card, an anniversary, a job well done -- restaurants are not just for those who can afford to splurge anymore. Instead, they have grown to fit every lifestyle and every budget. And our eating habits have evolved over time as well -- both in restaurants and at home -- but not always in ways that are good for our health. And that is another reason I wanted to talk to you today -- about an issue that is near and dear to my heart not just as First Lady, but as a mother -- and that is the epidemic of childhood obesity in America today. Now, I know you are all familiar with the statistics: how one in three children in this country is overweight or obese. And you know the consequences for their health -- from hypertension and diabetes to heart disease and even cancer. And I know you are all aware of the economic impact: the billions of dollars we spend every year treating obesity-related conditions -- costs that you pay in the form of rising health insurance premiums. So it is clear that we are facing a problem that is really big. And it is also clear that this problem has a whole range of different causes. Our kids are spending less time outside and more time on the couch in front of the TV, video games, the Internet. At school, gym classes, recess, they have been eliminated or shortened. Portion sizes in this country have ballooned. In some areas, families are having a tougher time getting regular access to fresh produce. And kids these days are consuming more calories and eating more fat and sugar than ever before. And that is why, earlier this year, we launched Let us Move! This is a nationwide campaign with a simple but ambitious goal: We want to solve the problem of childhood obesity in a generation, so that kids born today can reach adulthood at a healthy weight. And Let us Move! is about attacking this problem from all different angles. It is about giving parents the information and the resources they need to make healthy decisions for their families. It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. But here is the thing. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice. And the truth is that while restaurants are offering more options and families take advantage of them more often, they are not always the healthiest choices. Research has shown that kids consume more saturated fat and less fiber and calcium when they eat out. And the meals they eat at restaurants have twice as many calories as the ones they eat at home. Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently. But when stores and restaurants do not offer healthy options, or when parents do not have the information to make the best choices for their families, that is easier said than done. And as America's restaurant owners, you are responsible for one-third of the calories our kids get on a daily basis. The choices you make determine what is listed on the menus, what is advertised on billboards, and what is served on our plates. And your decisions about how a dish is prepared, what goes into it and where is it placed on the menu, that can have a real impact on the way people eat. And that is why we need your help. And we need your help now, because when you see research showing that obese toddlers already display some warning signs for heart disease, it is clear that we just do not have the time to waste. And that is why I have been so pleased to hear about what some of you are doing already both in working with us and on your own. Here at the NRA, you have developed the Food and Healthy Living Initiative to give restaurants a strong foundation for making healthy changes. You have launched a website, Healthydiningfinder.com, to help consumers identify healthy menu options in their area. You are keeping your members up to date with the latest information and statistics about efforts to address childhood obesity. And you are working with other groups in the industry to meet the goal of doubling the amount of produce used in the food industry over the next 10 years. And across the country, individual restaurants and chains are also focusing on our children's health -- not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it also makes sense for their bottom line. Right now, many restaurants are making a point to offer fresh produce and healthy choices aimed at kids and adults. Others are serving more low-fat dishes, whole grain breads, fruit on the side. Some are even offering kid-size portions of the meals they serve on the main menu. And chefs across the country are partnering with local schools to help them make healthy choices. But as positive as these examples are, the reality is it is just not enough. Together we have to do more. We have to go further. And we need your help to lead this effort. Now, what I do know is that in the restaurant industry creativity is your lifeblood. It is what sets you apart from the competition, and it keeps customers coming back for more. And today I am asking you to use that creativity to rethink the food you offer, especially dishes aimed at young people, and to help us make the healthier choice the easier choice. First, it is important to reduce the number of empty calories that our families are consuming, calories that have no nutritional benefit whatsoever. And believe me, I know this is easier said than done. After all, we as humans, we are programmed to crave sugary, fatty, salty foods. And as people who work to meet those needs, I know it is tempting to respond by creating products that are sweeter, richer and saltier than ever before. But here is the catch. See, feeding those cravings does just respond to people's natural desires, it actually helps shape them. The more of these foods people eat, the more they are accustomed to that taste, and after a while, those unhealthy foods become a permanent part of their eating habits. But here is the good news: It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And today, no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is Italian, French, Mexican, American -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. One local survey found that 90 percent of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; 80 percent includes chicken fingers; 60 includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over 1,000 calories, and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for the entire day. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. Now, again, I know it is easier said than done. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just one token healthy option on the menu, or taking out one problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime. This philosophy also needs to apply to the rest of the food that you offer, because just as we eat out as a family, we also should be able to eat well as a family. And as a mother of two soon-to-be teenagers, I know that many kids, especially tweens and teens, eat off the same menu that their parents do. I am not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love. That could mean substituting wheat pasta for white pasta in your regular recipes, or taking out an existing -- taking an existing dish and cutting the amount of butter or cream -- not enough to sacrifice flavor -- we all like flavor -- but just enough to make a meaningful difference in the amount of calories and fat. It could mean serving 1 percent or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request -- which would hurt me deeply. I am a fry lover. And no matter what you do, it is also important, truly important, to keep portion sizes in check, because we all know that the size of a meal is just as important as the ingredients it is made of. But your role in helping address childhood obesity is not limited to what you put on your menus and how you label them for parents. It is also about how you market those products to our kids. Our kids do not learn about the latest fast-food creations on their own. They hear about them on TV, advertisements, in the Internet, video games, and many other places. And as any parent knows, this marketing is highly effective. As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids. A study last year found that only a small percentage of advertising aimed at kids promoted healthy foods, while most promoted foods with a low nutritional value. And let us be clear: It is not enough just to limit ads for foods that are not healthy. It is also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy. And if there is anyone who can sell healthy food to our kids, it is all of you, because you know what gets their attention. You know what makes a lasting impression. You certainly know what gets them to drive their poor parents crazy because they just have to have something. So I am here today to ask you to use that knowledge and that power to our kids' advantage. I am asking you to actively promote healthy foods and healthy habits to our kids. Again, I know many of you have said that you would offer and promote healthy options in a heartbeat if they were as popular as the healthy -- unhealthy options, because that is how business works, and I understand that. But I have yet to meet a single parent who does not understand the threat of childhood obesity. I have yet to meet a single parent who is not eager to buy healthier products. They just need more information. They need easier access to those products. And I have heard from more companies over the year that the market is starting to move in a healthier direction. Folks are beginning to ask for more fruits and vegetables and for smaller portions. So when it comes right down to it, this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again. That is why we are committed to helping increase that demand and making it easier for you to do what is right. And we have started by requiring chain restaurants to provide calorie counts on their menus and menu boards. And I am grateful for the support we have received from the NRA to get this done. And I want to encourage restaurants that are not providing calorie counts to join us in this effort. And because so many of the calories our kids consume come from school, we are also working to get more nutritious food into our lunchrooms and our vending machines. And, again, the NRA has been playing an important role in these efforts as well. As part of Let us Move, we are setting a goal of doubling the number of schools that participate in the Healthier US Schools Challenge by next year. And we are working with schools and food suppliers to offer more fruits and vegetables and to cut down on that fat, sugar and salt. And, finally, we are working with mayors and other local officials to make our cities and towns healthier and to highlight restaurants that agree to serve smaller portions and promote more nutritious options. So I hope that all of you will join with us in these efforts. Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice. We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity. And we can help create a culture -- imagine this -- where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them. See, after all, that is one of the core ideals this industry was founded on. I recently learned that the term restaurant actually comes from the French word for restore. And when the idea of the restaurant business spread across the ocean, some of the first true restaurants in this country emphasized their ability to make people healthier and to cure what ailed them. So today, you are all the heirs to that legacy. And you face a similar opportunity both as business owners -- but also as parents, not just to fulfill your obligations to shareholders, but to fulfill the obligation we all have to the next generation. So I hope that each of you will do your part to give our kids the future that we all know they deserve. And I want to truly thank you for what you have done, because you have done so much, and for what you are going to do. I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead. Good luck to you all and God bless you and your families. Take care. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 670, "text": "Good morning. Laura and I are welcome-are proud to welcome and honored to welcome our friend Prime Minister Koizumi back to the White House. Japan and the United States have built a strong alliance and a close friendship. Decades ago, our two fathers looked across the Pacific and saw adversaries, uncertainty, and war. Today, their sons look across that same ocean and see friends and opportunity and peace. The friendship between our two nations is based on common values. These values include democracy, free enterprise, and a deep and abiding respect for human rights. These values have created a better life for both our peoples, a firm alliance between our two nations, and a common approach to our engagement with the world. These values are under attack by terrorist networks that bring death and destruction to all who oppose their hateful ideology, so the United States and Japan are working together to defend our shared values and win the war on terror. Japanese naval vessels have refueled hundreds of coalition ships as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Japan is now the third largest donor nation for reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. In Iraq, Japanese Self-Defense Forces have helped improve the lives of citizens in a key Iraqi Province that will soon return to Iraqi control. And Japan continues to provide critical airlift support to coalition forces in Iraq. The people of Japan can be proud of the contribution their Self-Defense Forces have made in the war on terror, and Americans are proud to serve alongside such courageous allies. Japan and the United States are cooperating to address other threats to our security. Our two nations are working together through the six-party talks, insisting that North Korea meet its pledge to abandon all nuclear weapons and its existing nuclear programs. Japan and the United States are also founding members of the Proliferation Security Initiative that is working to keep dangerous weapons from rogue states and terrorist groups. And our two nations are repositioning our forces to counter the emerging threats of the 21st century. As we meet threats to our security, we are also working together to improve the lives of our people and address common challenges. Our two economies are the largest in the world, and we are working to expand trade and investment opportunities for both our peoples. Japan and the United States are working together for a successful conclusion to the Doha negotiations, which would add to the prosperity of our nations and help lift millions in the developing world out of poverty. With prosperity comes responsibility. So our two nations helped build the Asian-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, so we can make the latest energy technologies more widely available, reduce pollution, and increase energy efficiency. Americans cherish our friendship with the Japanese people and value our alliance with the nation of Japan. And we honor the leadership of Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi. He is a man of vision; he is a man of integrity. And I am proud to call him my friend. I thank the Prime Minister for coming to the White House. And I am looking forward to joining him tomorrow at Graceland. Officially, he is here to see ENTITY, but I know the highlight of his visit will be paying his respects to the King. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your leadership, and welcome back to America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswelcomingceremonyforprimeministerjunichirokoizumijapan", "title": "Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-welcoming-ceremony-for-prime-minister-junichiro-koizumi-japan", "publication_date": "29-06-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 869, "text": "Well, it is good to see you all again. I have not thought of anything. I thought I could tell you a few things off the record. Of course, well, for instance, Steve just came in to give me a thing that just arrived about our aircraft production. I think some of us real old people remember a day when I went up to Congress and said we need for national defense fifty thousand airplanes in a year. Well, there was the most awful howl all over the country could not be done just could not be done. Well, we are now up to a hundred thousand a year, and we are keeping on going keeping on making records. American industry has done a lot better than the non-business press. thought it could do. The two-hundred-thousandth United States-financed airplane since July 1, 1940, was accepted on May 31 of this year, a year and three days after the acceptance of the one-hundred-thousandth- which is pretty good. The first hundred thousand, as they say, is the hardest. The first hundred thousand took 1431 days to build. The second hundred thousand took 369 days to build, approximately only a third as long. And in May, 8,851 were accepted. That was actually two percent in numbers below the March peak. But a thing that the layman does not understand, which you will understand, is that the weight, 89 million pounds, is really the controlling factor; and that was one percent over March, which is again a new high. The rest of the figures relate to different types, but just for example, just in one field of action, we have ten thousand American planes working. In another field of action, we have over five thousand American planes. Now, they are operating planes. Of course, the figures vary from day to day, but that is an awful lot of planes that we have got overseas. I have not got the figures for some of the other areas, but that is just two out of three or four different areas where we are operating planes. Of course, the whole thing is going along awfully well. I hope that you are in touch with the Departments, and with Leo Crowley, about places where either there is a jam or we want more things. Now, of course, one thing we have realized, and that is that with the development of warfare we discover new things all the time- new construction. I do not suppose any one of us could have visioned three years ago the building of this vast number of landing craft, turning them out all over the place with all the things that go with landing craft. In the present operations in France, they have been badly bumped on the beaches. They sit down on top of a boulder, and the boulder comes through the bottom that sort of thing. Quite a lot of them have been damaged on the railroad rails that the Germans stuck down on the beaches; and sometimes, when they have discharged their cargo on the beach and start to back up, they find they are sitting on the sharp end of a railroad rail. But, of course, a great many of them can be salvaged, but the last three days show that we have got to speed that particular construction up even some more. We thought we had speeded it up just as fast as we possibly could. Things are going pretty well on the other side. The chief trouble is weather. The English Channel is not a pleasant place to cross. It is rough a great deal. As somebody remarked to me the other day, probably there has been more human suffering on the English Channel than any other place in the world. And on the whole, things are going along pretty well. We have been doing awfully well north of Rome, since I spoke the other day. We are about 40 miles north of Rome. We have got the important seaport of Civitavecchia. Yet the whole operation- the English Channel, and the Mediterranean Italy- all tie in together, as we have come to understand. I think the greatest contribution there is always a silver lining in every cloud that war makes is teaching people geography. A lot of people in this country now know where Italy is. Now, that is quite an achievement. And of course, on the whole, I really think that we can feel encouraged, but we mustn't be overoptimistic .... Of course, we are trying to plan all we can on the reconversion of plants, which will be of interest to nearly all of you. I think the Executive end of things has done all it could. They have made various recommendations to Congress for legislation, and nothing has yet come out of the hopper. So the more that you do to encourage Congress to speed up a little on reconversion legislation, the better it is. We have done practically all that we can here. I do not know what will come out, but we would like to have something come out. So, if you can help on that, it is all to the good. Industry has done a perfectly splendid job. And we are doing all we can to think not only about the rest of the war, but about the period after the war.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsfromthepressconferenceforbusinesspapereditors", "title": "Excerpts from the Press Conference for Business Paper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/excerpts-from-the-press-conference-for-business-paper-editors", "publication_date": "09-06-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 949, "text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, my fellow delegates, to all those who dedicate themselves to this noble mission of this institution. It is my honor to speak to you for the first time as president of the United States. We meet this year in a moment of intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility. We have lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world and impact so much on our existence. We are mourning more than 4.5 million people, people of every nation, from every background. Each death is an individual heartbreak, but our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity and to act together. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at the dawning of what must be a decisive decade for our world. A decade that will quite literally determine our futures. As a global community, we are challenged by urgent and looming crises, and where in lie enormous opportunities if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities. Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19 everywhere and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic, for there will be another one? Or will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal as more virulent, dangerous variants take hold? Will we meet the threat of the challenging climate we are all feeling already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather, or will we suffer the merciless march of ever worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves and rising seas? Will we affirm and uphold the human dignity and human rights under which nations in common cause more than seven decades ago formed this institution? Will we apply and strengthen the core tenants of the international system, including the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as we seek to shape the emergence of new technologies and deter new threats. Or will we allow those universal principles to be trampled and twisted in the pursuit of naked political power? In my view, how we answer these questions in this moment, whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not, will reverberate for generations yet to come. Simply put, we stand in my view at an inflection point in history. And I am here today to share with you how the United States intends to work with partners and allies to answer these questions. And the commitment of my new administration helped lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people. Instead of continuing to fight the wars of the past, we are fixing our eyes on devoting our resources of the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future. Ending this pandemic, addressing the climate crisis, managing the shifts in global power dynamics, shaping the rules of the world on vital issues like trade, cyber, and emerging technologies and facing the threat of terrorism as it stands today. We have ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan. And as we close this period of relentless war, we are opening a new era of relentless diplomacy, of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world, of renewing and defending democracy, proving that no matter how challenging or how complex the problems we are going to face, government by and for the people is still the best way to deliver for all of our people. And as the United States turns our focus to the priorities and the regions of the world, like the Indo-Pacific that are most consequential today and tomorrow, we will do so with our allies and partners through cooperation and multilateral institutions like the United Nations to amplify our collective strength and speed, our progress toward dealing with these global challenges. It is the fundamental truth of the 21st century within each of our countries and as a global community, that our own success is bound up in other succeeding as well. To deliver for our own people, we must also engage deeply with the rest of the world to ensure that our own future, we must work together with other partners, our partners toward a shared future. Our security, our prosperity, and our very freedoms are interconnected in my view as never before. And so, I believe we must work together as never before. Over the last eight months, I prioritized rebuilding our alliances, revitalizing our partnerships, and recognizing they are essential and central to America's enduring security and prosperity. We have reaffirmed our sacred NATO Alliance to article five commitment. We are working with our allies toward a new strategic concept that will help our alliance better take on the evolving threats of today and tomorrow. We renewed our engagement with the European Union, a fundamental partner in tackling the full range of significant issues facing our world today. We elevated the quad partnership among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States to take on challenges ranging from health security, to climate, to emerging technologies. We are engaging with regional institutions from to the African Union to the Organization of American States, to focus on people's urgent needs for better health and better economic outcomes. We are back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations to focus attention and dispar global action on shared challenges. We are reengaged at the World Health Organization and working in close partnership with Kovacs to deliver life-saving vaccines around the world. We rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and we are running to retake a seat in the Human Rights Council next year at the UN. And as the United States seeks to rally the world action, we will lead not just through the example of our power, but God willing with the power of our example. Make no mistake. The United States will continue to defend ourselves, our allies, and our interest against attack, including terrorist threats, as we prepare to use force, if any is necessary. But to defend our vital US national interest, including against ongoing and imminent threats. But the mission must be clear and achievable. Undertaken with informed consent of the American people. And whenever possible, in partnership with our allies. US military power must be our tool of last resort. Not our first. It should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the world. Indeed, today, many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms. Bombs and bullets cannot- through the force of arms. Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants. To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots and arms as fast as possible, and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world. And for the future, we need to create a new mechanism to finance global health security that builds on our existing development assistance and a global health threat council that is armed with the tools we need to monitor and identify emerging pandemics so that we can take immediate action. Already the United States has put more than $15 billion toward the global COVID response. We have shipped more than 160 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to other countries. This includes 130 million doses from our own supply and the first tranches of the half a billion doses of Pfizer vaccine, we purchased to donate through COVAX. Planes carrying vaccines from the United States have already landed in 100 countries, bringing people all over the world, a little dose of hope as one American nurse termed it to me. A dose of hope direct from the American people and importantly, no strings attached. And tomorrow at the US hosted Global COVID-19 Summit, I will be announcing additional commitments as we seek to advance the fight against COVID-19 and hold ourselves accountable around specific targets on three key challenges. Saving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better. This year has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis. The extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world, and you all know it and feel it represent what the Secretary General has rightly called code red for humanity. And the scientists and experts are telling us that we are fast approaching a point of no return in a literal sense. To keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, every nation needs to bring their highest possible ambitions to the table when we meet in Glasgow for COP26. And then to have to keep raising our collective ambition over time. In April, I announced the United States ambitious new goal under the Paris Agreement. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the United States by 50 to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030, as we work toward achieving the clean energy economy with net zero emissions by 2050. And my administration's working closely with our Congress to make critical investments in green infrastructure and electric vehicles will help us lock in progress at home toward our climate goals. And the best part is making these ambitious investments is not just good climate policy, it is a chance for each of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future. It is an enormous opportunity to create good paying jobs for workers in each of our countries and to spur long-term economic growth that will improve the quality of life for all of our people. We also have to support the countries and people that will be hit the hardest and that have the fewest resources to help them adapt. In April, I announced that United States will double our public international financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis. And today, I am proud to announce that we will work with the Congress to double that number again, including for adaptation efforts. This will make the United States leader in public climate finance, and with our added support together with increased private capital from other donors, we will be able to meet the goal of mobilizing $100 billion to support climate action in developing nations. As we deal with these crises, we are also encountering a new era. An era of new technologies and possibilities that have potential to release and reshape every aspect of human existence. And it is up to all of us to determine whether these technologies are forced to empower people or to deepen repression. As new technologies continue to evolve, we will work together with our democratic partners to ensure that new advances in areas from biotechnology to quantum computing, 5G, artificial intelligence, and more are used to lift people up, to solve problems and advance human freedom, not to suppress dissent or target minority communities. And the United States tends to make a profound investment in research and innovation, working with countries at all stages of economic development to develop new tools and technologies to help us tackle the challenges of this second quarter of the 21st century and beyond. We are hardening our critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, disrupting ransomware networks and working to establish clear rules of the road for all nations, as it relates to cyberspace. We reserve the right to respond decisively to cyber attacks that threaten our people, our allies, or our interest. We will pursue new rules of global trade and economic growth to strive a level of playing field. So it is not artificially tipped in favor of any one country at the expense of others. And every nation has the right and opportunity to compete fairly. We will strive to ensure that basic labor rights, environmental safeguards, and intellectual property are protected, and that the benefits of globalization are shared broadly throughout all our societies. We will continue to uphold the long-standing rules and norms that have formed the guardrails of international engagement for decades that have been essential to the development of nations around the world. Bedrock commitments, like freedom of navigation, adherence to international laws and treaties, support for arms control measures to reduce the risk and enhance transparency. Our approach is firmly around it and fully consistent with the United Nation's mission and the values we have agreed to when we drafted this charter. These are commitments we all made, and that we are all bound to uphold. And as we strive to deal with these urgent challenges, whether they are long-standing or newly emerging, we must also deal with one another. All of the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships. So they do not tip from responsible competition to conflict. The United States will compete and we will compete vigorously and lead with our values and our strength. We will stand up for our allies and our friends and oppose attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones, whether through changes to territory by force, economic coercion or technical exploitation or disinformation, but we are not seeking, say it again, we are not seeking a new cold war or a world divided into rigid blocks. The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to share challenges even if we have intense disagreements in Even if we have intense disagreement in other areas, because we will all suffer the consequences of our failure, if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19 and climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation. The United States remains committed for ready to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Where are working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically, and to seek a return to JCPOA. We are prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does the same. Similarly, we seek serious and sustained diplomacy to pursue the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We seek concrete progress toward an available plan with tangible commitments that would increase stability on the peninsula and in the region, as well as improve the lives of the people in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We must also remain vigilant to the threat of terror, that terrorism poses to all our nations. Whether emanating from distant regions of the world, or in our own backyard. We know the bitter string of terrorism. The bitter sting of terrorism is real. We have almost all experienced it. Last month, we lost 13 American heroes and almost 200 innocent Afghan civilians in a heinous terrorist attack at Kabul airport. Those who commit acts of terrorism against us will continue to find a determined enemy in the United States. The world today is not the world of 2001 though, and the United States is not the same country we were when we were attacked on 9/11, 20 years ago. Today, we are better equipped to detect, to prevent terrorist threats and we are more resilient in our ability to repel them and to respond. We know how to build effective partnerships to dismantle terrorist networks by targeting their financing and support systems, countering their propaganda, preventing their travel as well as disrupting imminent attacks. We will meet terrorist threats that arise today and the future with a full range of tools available to us, including working in cooperation with local partners so that we need not be so reliant on large scale military deployments. One of the most important ways we can effectively enhance security and reduce violence is by seeking to improve the lives of the people all over the world, who see that their governments are not serving their needs. Corruption fuels inequality, siphons off a nation's resources, spreads across borders and generates human suffering. It is nothing less than a national security threat in the 21st century. Around the world, we are increasingly seeing citizens demonstrate their discontent. Seeing the wealthy and well connected grow richer and richer, taking payoffs and bribes, operating above the law while the vast majority of the people struggle to find a job or put food on the table or to get their businesses off the ground, or simply send their children to school. People have taken to the streets in every region to demand that their governments address people's basic needs, give everyone a fair shot to succeed and protect their God-given rights. And in that chorus of voices, across languages and continents, we hear a common cry. A cry for dignity, simple dignity. As leaders, it is our duty to answer that call, not to silence it. The United States has committed to using our resources and our international platform to support these voices, listen to them, partner with them, to find ways to respond that advance human dignity around the world. For example, there is an enormous need for infrastructure in developing countries. With infrastructure that is low quality or that feeds corruption or exacerbates environmental degradation, may only end up contributing to greater challenges for countries over time. Done the right way, however, with transparent, sustainable investment in projects that respond to the country's needs and engage their local workers to maintain high labor and environmental standards, infrastructure can be a strong foundation that allows societies in low and middle income countries to grow and to prosper. That is the idea behind the Build Back Better world. And together with the private sector and our G7 partners, we aim to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment. We will also continue to be the world's largest contributor to humanitarian assistance, bringing food, water, shelter, emergency healthcare, and other vital life-saving aid to millions of people in need. When the earthquake strikes, the typhoon rages or disaster anywhere in the world, the United States shows up, we will be ready to help. And at a time when nearly one in three people globally do not have access to adequate food, adequate food just last year, the United States is committing to rallying our partners to address immediate malnutrition and to ensure that we can sustainably feed the world for the decades to come. To that end, the United States is making a $10 billion commitment to end hunger and invest in food systems at home and abroad. Since 2000, the United States government has provided more than $140 billion to advance health and strengthen health systems. And we will continue our leadership to drive these vital investments to make people's lives better every single day, just give them a little breathing room. And as we strive to make lives better, we must work with renewed purpose to end the conflicts that are driving so much pain and hurt around the world. We must redouble our diplomacy and commit to political negotiations, not violence, as a tool of first resort, to manage tensions around the world. We must seek a future of greater peace and security for all people of the Middle East. The commitment of the United States Digital Securities, without question, are our support for an independent Jewish state is unequivocal, but I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish democratic state, living in peace, alongside of viable sovereign and democratic Palestinian state. We are a long way from that goal at this moment, but we must never allow ourselves to give up on the possibility of progress. We cannot give up on solving raging civil conflicts, including in Ethiopia and Yemen, who are fighting between warring parties is driving famine, horrific violence, human rights violations against civilians, including an unconscionable use of rape, as a weapon of war. We will continue to work with the international community, to press for peace and bring an end to this suffering. As we pursue diplomacy across the board, the United States will champion the democratic values that go to the very heart of who we are as a nation and a people. Freedom, equality, opportunity, and a belief in the universal rights of all people. It is stamped into our DNA as a nation and critically it is stamped into the DNA of this institution, the United States, we sometimes forget. To quote the opening words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, quote, The equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the All members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. The founding ethos of the United Nations places the rights of individuals at the center of our system, and that clarity and vision must not be ignored or misinterpreted. The United States will do our part, but we will be more successful and more impactful if all of our nations are working toward the full mission to which we are called. That is why more than 100 nations united around a shared statement, and the Security Council adopted a resolution outlining how we will support the people of Afghanistan moving forward, laying out the expectations to which we will hold the Taliban when it comes to respecting universal human rights. We all must advocate for the rights of women and girls to use their full talents, to contribute economically, politically, and socially, and pursue their dreams free of violence and intimidation, from Central America to the Middle East to Africa to Afghanistan, wherever it appears in the world. We all must call out and condemn the targeting and oppression of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, whether it occurs in Xinjiang or northern Ethiopia or anywhere in the world. We all must defend the rights of LGBTQI individuals so they can live and love openly without fear, whether it is Chechnya or Cameroon or anywhere. As we steer our nations toward this inflection point and work to meet today's fast-moving, cross-cutting challenges, let me be clear. I am not agnostic about the future we want for the world. The future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it. The future will belong to those who unleash the potential of their people, not those who stifle it. The future will belong to those who give their people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand. The authoritarians of the world may seek to proclaim the end of the age of democracy, but they are wrong. The truth is, the democratic world is everywhere. It lives in anti-corruption activists, human rights defenders, the journalists, the peace protesters, on the front lines of this struggle in Belarus, Burma, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, and everywhere in between. It lives in the brave women of Sudan who withstood violence and oppression to push a genocidal dictator from power and who keep working every day to defend their democratic progress. It lives in the proud Moldovans who helped deliver a landslide victory for the forces of democracy with a mandate to fight graft to build a more inclusive economy. It lives in the young people of Zambia who harnessed the power of their vote for the first time, turning out in record numbers to denounce corruption and chart a new path for their country. And while no democracy is perfect, including the United States, we will continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions, and we face down violence and insurrection. Democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential. My fellow leaders, this is the moment where we must prove ourselves the equals of those who come before us, who with vision and values and determined faith in our collective future built our United Nations, broke the cycle of war and destruction, and laid the foundations for more than seven decades of relative peace and growing global prosperity. Now we must again come together to affirm the inherent humanity that unites us is much greater than any outward divisions or disagreements. We must choose to do more than we think we can do alone, so that we accomplish what we must together. Ending this pandemic and making sure we are better prepared for the next one; staving off climactic climate change and increasing our resilience to the impacts we already are seeing; ensuring a future where technologies are the vital tool to solving human challenges and empowering human potential, not a source of greater strife and repression. These are the challenges that will determine what the world looks like for our children and our grandchildren and what they will inherit. We can only meet them by looking to the future. I stand here today, for the first time in 20 years, the United States is not at war. We have turned the page. All the unmatched strength, energy, and commitment, will and resources of our nation, are now fully and squarely focused on what is ahead of us, not what was behind. I know this; as we look ahead, we will lead. We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from COVID to climate, peace and security, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone. We will lead together, with our allies and partners, in cooperation with all those who believe as we do, that this is within our power to meet these challenges, to build a future that lifts all of our people and preserves this planet. But none of this is inevitable. It is a choice. And I can tell you where America stands. We will choose to build a better future. We, you and I, we have the will and capacity to make it better. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot afford to waste any more time. Let us get to work. Let us make our better future now. We can do this. It is within our power and capacity. Thank you. God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenungeneralassemblyspeechtranscriptclimateagendacovid19vaccines", "title": "Joe Biden UN General Assembly Speech Transcript: Climate Agenda, COVID-19 Vaccines", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-un-general-assembly-speech-transcript-climate-agenda-covid-19-vaccines", "publication_date": "21-09-2021", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Joe Biden"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 759, "text": "Let me just first greet the members of the fire-service community, Members of Congress who are here, officials from FEMA, Fire Marshal Bernard Johnson, Fire Chief Rayfield Alfred, my own firefighters call them my own Engine Company 13 and Tower 10 welcome to the White House. We have got a few fires to put out around here, and that is why I have been late. Thank you very much. More than 2,100,000 fires broke out in the U.S. this year, claiming 6,000 lives. Fires strike at the most vulnerable among us, especially children and the elderly. And it also strikes the most valiant among us; many casualties are, indeed, the firefighters who lose their lives in a last-ditch struggle to save someone else's life. Then, after the cost in lives, we have got to count the enormous property losses in excess of $8 billion. Now, these dollars cannot adequately represent the tragedy of so many beloved homes, churches, and businesses literally going up in smoke. There is an army of dedicated Americans who stand ready to fight these fires, any-time, anyplace: the more than 1 million firefighters. The organizations involved in fire prevention efforts are too numerous to mention. But all are true heroes, and their heroic role is on display here today for National Fire Prevention Week. At the Federal level, the U.S. Fire Administration, part of FEMA, is the national leader in firefighting and emergency response. These men and women from the Fire Administration are dedicated to the development of effective programs to help fire departments, State and local governments, private business and organizations, and educators promote fire safety and awareness in communities across the country. At the State level, many dedicated agencies labor to provide training courses for firefighters and emergency medical technicians, arson investigation services, and research. And of course, in virtually every community across this great country are the men and women who make up the front lines in the battle, the firefighters, both career and volunteers, who continue a long and distinguished tradition of firefighting that goes back all the way to the first volunteer fire company founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1736. Congress also has a role to play through the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, whose cochairmen are Senator McCain and Congressman Curt Weldon. The caucus boasts 370 Congressmen and Senators 370 making it the largest on Capitol Hill. Most of all, Congress recently updated our safety laws in the Hotel-Motel Fire Safety Act, authored by Congressman Sherry Boehlert. All of these groups, from volunteers to Members of Congress, can tell you that the best way to fight fire is not with fire but with prevention. The National Fire Protection Association does a great job in this endeavor, working with young people such as Shanta Jones, the 1990 NFPA national fire safety poster contest child winner. In this and in so many other ways, they are getting the word out on fire prevention. As you know, Tuesday marked the anniversary of a key event in American history, the great Chicago fire, a sweeping conflagration that destroyed most of that great city back in 1871. Years later, outrage over devastating citywide fires led to a national effort to prevent fires. To focus this national campaign, President Wilson proclaimed October 9, 1920, National Fire Prevention Day. In 1922 President Harding made it Fire Prevention Week, saying that fire prevention should be practiced by every man, woman, and child not only during the week designated in this pronouncement but throughout every hour of every day of the year. That is true today. Every hour of every day, we can help save a life by preventing a fire. And we can keep these brave men and women with us today from having to risk their lives to save ours. So, I am again very pleased to be with you all and to sign the proclamation declaring this week as National Fire Prevention Week. Thank you all for coming down.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthefirepreventionweekproclamation", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Fire Prevention Week Proclamation", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-fire-prevention-week-proclamation", "publication_date": "11-10-1990", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 943, "text": "My fellow Americans, four years ago we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do, and so much more. This week we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck, a very important word. I'd like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter, Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Baron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife, Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the dedicated members of the White House staff, and the cabinet, and all of the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people, the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House military office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the armed forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that is what it is, a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our capital. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for president because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena, nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking Patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about America first because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left. It was not about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fix our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal. And we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA, that is Mexico and Canada, a deal that is worked out very, very well. Also and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China, made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing. Billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the US but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it would not have worked out this way. We would not have some of the best numbers we have ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's number one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America's job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women, almost everyone. Income soared, wages boomed. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during the short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401s are at a level they have never been at before. We have never seen numbers like we have seen, and that is before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase Made in the USA. To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed and more will quickly follow. They said it could not be done, but we did it. They called it a medical miracle. And that is what they are calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken three, four, five, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months. We grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world's economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation's borders. I am pleased to say, we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in US history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please do not lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military, all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalize our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader al-Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world's top terrorist, Iranian butcher, Qassem Soleimani. We recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that in America the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests corporations or global entities, it is to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As president my top priority, my constant concern has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course. By far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that is what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy. Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have the government listen. You are loyal to your country and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It is incredible. Now, as I leave the white house, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world's most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common, the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It is not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions. In America, we do not insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just do not do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That is not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me. They came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction, that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are and must always be a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw, from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly, and from the forbidden city in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you. I fought for your family. I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for, and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There is never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle, but instead, only grows stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts, deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation can not achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong and our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptspresidentdonaldtrumpfarewelladdressspeechtranscript", "title": "President Donald Trump Farewell Address Speech Transcript", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-donald-trump-farewell-address-speech-transcript", "publication_date": "19-01-2021", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 587, "text": "Thank you all very much. Thanks. The reason this is such a successful event is because people know that Bob Ehrlich will make a great Governor for Maryland. I believe it, and that is why I am here. I believe that is the reason why Democrats and Republicans support this good man-because he is honest, he is hard-working, and he is got a positive vision for everybody who lives in the State of Maryland. I am here because this man is somebody who wants to unite this State, not divide it. And I am here because he married well. I appreciate Kendel, and I know Bob does as well. And I want you to know, I appreciate Laura, too. She is sorry she cannot be here tonight. She is-you know, when I married her, she was a public school librarian. She was living in Texas, and so was I. The truth of the matter is she did not like politics then. And she was not too fond of politicians either. And here she is, married to me. But people, as they have gotten to know Laura, now know the reason why I asked her to marry me. She is really a fine, fine lady. A lot of her buddies are wondering why she said yes. But she does send her best and sends all her support to the Ehrlichs and wishes them all the best and joins me in urging the people of Maryland to give this good man a chance to be the Governor of this important State. I have known the next Lieutenant Governor for a while. He is a good, solid citizen of the State of Maryland. He will work well with Bob. It is an honor to be on the podium with the next Lieutenant Governor of the State of Maryland, Michael Steele. And I had the honor of meeting his good wife, Andrea, and I appreciate Andrea standing by her man during this tough campaign here. Campaigns are hard. They are not easy on a family. But I appreciate- I appreciate her joining Michael in this race. I am honored to be back with former Congressman, soon-to-be Congresswoman Helen Bentley. I figure that when she wins, she will be telling me what to do. And those of you know, who know Helen, know that I'd better listen. It is great to see Helen. I love her spirit. I know she is going to win. I am also proud to be here with Ellen Sauerbrey, who is the national committeewoman. I want to thank Chairman Louis Pope of the Republican Party. I want to thank all the grassroots activists who are here. I want to thank you for-- I did not ask for any speeches; I just said-. Okay, let me tell you what you are going to have to do then. I want to thank you for what you are going to do, which is to turn out the vote. Listen, a lot of you never get thanked enough. I am thanking you. I am thanking you for dialing the phones and putting up the signs and for mailing the letters. I am thanking you for going to your community centers and your coffee shops. I am thanking you for supporting this ticket ahead of time, because they need your help, and they want your work. You have got to talk it up between now and election day. And you have got to find those Ehrlich voters and make sure they go to the polls, and this man will be your next Governor. And there is some reasons why. You need somebody who can manage your government, somebody who knows how to balance the books without raising the taxes on the taxpayers-that is what you need. You need somebody who can make a tough decision who does not need a poll or a focus group to tell him how to think, somebody who stands on principle, somebody who will do in office what he says he will do. And when he says he will not raise your taxes, he will not raise your taxes. I appreciate the fact that Governor Ehrlich will set education as the number one priority for this State. The way I used to put it when I was a Governor, I said, Education is to a State what national defense is to the Federal Government. Education has got to be the number one priority of your Governor, and it will be Bob's number one priority. We share the same philosophy. It says, Every child can learn. That is what we believe. See, that is important to have in your Governor's office, somebody who is willing to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations. You see, if you lower standards, if you lower the bar, you are going go get lousy results. And that is not fair for the children. Governor Ehrlich will raise the standards. He will trust the local people to manage their way to excellence. But he and I agree on this, and that is, we have got to know. See, as a society, we have got to measure to determine whether or not our children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. It is essential that you have a Governor who is strong on accountability. You see, if you believe every child can learn, then you are willing to measure. If you believe certain children cannot learn, then you do not care, and you do not measure. But in order to make sure no child gets left behind in the State of Maryland, you must have a Governor who uses the accountability system to praise those teachers and principals who succeed on behalf of the children but also someone who is willing to challenge the schools which will not teach and will not change. Bob Ehrlich will be a Governor who will make sure that no child is left behind in the State of Maryland. The job of a Governor is to create an environment in which people can find work and the economy grows. That is why he is insistent upon infrastructure, to be wise about the use of taxpayers' money, to expand the asset base which will encourage private sector growth. I love his vision about the Port of Baltimore and the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. He understands job creation. See, that is what he knows. And it is important to have somebody in the Governor's office who understands how jobs are created. The role of Government is not to create wealth. The role of Government is to create an environment in which the entrepreneur can realize his or her dreams, in which small businesses can grow to be big businesses. That is the kind of Governor you need. He will be effective. He is smart. He is compassionate, and his record speaks to his compassion. He worked for tax credits for parents who adopt children. He worked hard to make sure there is equal health insurance benefits for the mentally ill. He works to have increased access to individuals in the workplace who may be disabled. See, that is the kind of Governor you want. You want somebody who is tough when it comes to the budget, making sure that it is balanced but compassionate when it comes to helping people who need help. There is no question in my mind that this man, when elected, will make Maryland a safer and stronger and better place for every citizen who lives in this State. And my job as the President is to make sure America is a safer and stronger and better country. A strong country is one in which people can find work. Anytime somebody is looking for work and they cannot find work in America, I think we have a problem. And we have got to do everything we can at the Federal level to make sure our economy grows. I worry about people who have lost value in their 401s. I worry about people looking for work who cannot find work. I worry about uncertainty. We are beginning to make progress because the foundations for growth are strong. Interest rates are low. Inflation is down. The productivity of the American worker is the highest and best in the world. We have got a lot of strong things going for us. For a while there was a kind of an overhang in our economy because we had some of our citizens who thought they could fudge the books, who forgot what it means to be a responsible citizen, who got caught up in money, not in responsibility. I had the honor of signing, and Bob voted for, the most significant corporate reform since Franklin Roosevelt was the President. Our message to corporate America, to those citizens who think they can cheat, is, Those days are over with. When I first came in, I was aware that the economy was dragging. And that is why I worked with Congressman Ehrlich and others to pass a significant tax cut, because I took a page out of this economic textbook. The page said if you let a person keep more of their own money-and notice I said more of their own money; it is not the Government's money, it is your money-if you keep more of your own money, if you have more money in your pocket, you are going to demand a good or a service. And when you demand a good or a service, in this marketplace economy, somebody's going to produce the good or a service. And when somebody produces the good or a service, somebody is more likely to find work. If you are interested in creating more jobs, you let people keep more of their own money. The tax cuts came at the exact right time in American economic history. We slashed the marriage penalty. We believe that the Tax Code ought to encourage families and encourage marriage, not discourage families and marriage. And we did something else to help the entrepreneur and the farmer and the rancher, and that is we put the death tax on the way to extinction. But here is the problem; here is the problem-this is kind of hard to explain. The rules in the Senate are such that that tax relief plan that we all worked so hard to enact goes away after 10 years. So the Senate giveth, and the Senate taketh away. For the sake of job creation, for the sake of economic expansion, for the sake of those who want to find work- the Congress needs to make the tax cuts permanent. I worry about hardhats trying to find work. I worry about that. And so-I met, I guess it was yesterday-time flies up there--but I met yesterday with Members of the House and Senate, both parties, to urge them to pass a terrorism insurance bill. There is over $15 billion worth of projects, construction projects, which are not going forward because people cannot get terrorism insurance. And for the sake of economic vitality, for the sake of job creation, for the sake of hardhats-they need to get together and get a bill: a bill, by the way, which does not reward trial lawyers and does reward working people in America. I want to assure you, we will not rest until people can find work. And I look forward to working with ways to create the environment for economic expansion. I want to work to make America more confident about our future. One way to make sure that Americans are more confident about the future and availability of capital is to make sure Congress does not overspend. And we have a problem in Washington, right around the corner from here. Every idea sounds like a brilliant idea. The problem is, they have all got billions of dollars attached to them as price tags. There is no budget in the United States Senate. They could not pass a budget. You can imagine what that means. It means that there is the tendency to overspend. For the sake of economic vitality, for the sake of making sure people can find work, the Congress must fund our priorities and not overspend the people's money. We must be fiscally sound in Washington, DC, if we want our economy to grow. A stronger America is one in which people can find work. And while I am optimistic about our future, while I understand the spirit of the-the entrepreneurial spirit is strong, we have got work to do. We have got work to do on the economy. And we have also got work to do to make sure America is a safer place. Economic vitality and growth are a really important part of my job and what is on my mind, but nothing more on my mind than protecting the American people. That is my most important job now, is to make sure that the enemy does not hit us again. And they are still out there. They are out there because of what we love and what they hate. They are out there because we love freedom. We love the fact that our fellow citizens can worship an almighty God any way he or she sees fit. We love that, and we are never going to relinquish that freedom. We love our diversity. We love the fact that people can realize their dreams in America, regardless of where their mom or dad was born. That is what we love. We love the fact that this great country-in this great country you can speak your mind freely. We love a free press. We love everything about our freedoms. And yet we face an enemy which hates freedom. They hate us because of what we love. We also value life in America. Everybody's precious. Everybody counts. Everybody has worth in this country. And the enemy is nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers who are willing to take innocent life in the name of a hijacked religion. And that is who we fight. It is a new reality we face; it just is. This is the first war of the 21st century, but it is a different kind of war. And therefore, I have spent a lot of time explaining to the American people how best we can keep the peace and what we must do to win this new war. It starts with making sure we do everything here at home to organize the agencies involved with the defense of the homeland. There is over 100 different agencies in Washington, DC, involved with your protection. Before September the 11th, none of them really had as their number one priority the protection of the homeland. Now they should. In order to make sure that we change culture and set priority, I have asked Congress to join me in the creation of a Department of Homeland Security. Listen, I readily concede my slogan was not , Vote for George. He wants your Government to be bigger. That was not my slogan. My slogan--what I want to have happen is, I want the Government to work. I want to be able to better do the job you expect me to do. And there-fore-and therefore, I call upon the Senate to join the House in creating a Department of Homeland Security which enables this President and future Presidents to be able to move people to the right place at the right time in order to protect America. I need the ability to manage the process. I do not need rules and regulations. I do not need micromanagement by the legislative branch. The House passed a good bill, and now the Senate must do so. They must get after it before they go home. I need a good bill, and I will not accept anything less. See, this is a chance to leave-for the Congress to leave a legacy for future people, future Presidents, future administrations, to deal with this real threat we face. But I want you to know, and you need to know, there are a lot of good folks working hard here in America to protect you; there really are. And we are doing a better job. We have got great police and fire, lots of FBI agents and CIA agents working hard. Anytime we get any hint about something might happen, a scintilla of evidence, we are moving on it; we are. We are more responsive. We are more alert. We are disrupting. We are making progress, all within the confines of the United States Constitution. But the best way to protect the homeland, short term and long term, is to chase the killers down, one at a time, and bring them to justice. This is the kind of war- we do not face people who have got tanks and destroyers and bombers. That is a different kind of war. Those are wars of the past. This is a war in which we are fighting resourceful, determined people who hide in caves or the dark recesses of certain cities, and then send youngsters to their suicidal deaths. That is the kind of people we fight. They are-they are haters, is what they are. And therefore, we are on an international manhunt. And we are making progress. That is just what you have got to know. Sometimes it is hard to tell; it is hard to measure progress. If you are not destroying equipment, it is hard to tell. But we have captured over a couple of thousand of them. I say we -the doctrine that says, Either you are with us, or you are with the enemy, still stands. That doctrine is still a part of American foreign policy. And so there is a lot of countries working with us. We are sharing intelligence. We are disrupting their finances, and we are hauling them in. The other day we got the fellow-I forgot the guy's name-bin al-Shibh, or whatever his name was. He thought he was going to be the 20th hijacker. No, that was not Moussaoui. Bin al-Shibh is the guy's name. And he popped his head up, and now he is no longer a problem. We are making progress. We are making progress. We are working with our friends. We have got a vast coalition of people who understand the stakes and understand the nature of the war. I said we hauled in a couple of thousand; a like number were not as lucky. Slowly but surely, we are dismantling this particular terrorist network. I want to thank those of you who have got loved ones in the United States military. I am proud of our military. They are making a huge difference. They are brave, brave troops. I sent the largest increase in defense spending to Capitol Hill since Ronald Reagan was the President up to Congress, because I wanted to send two messages: One, anytime our troops go into harm's way, they deserve the best pay, the best training, and the best possible equipment; and secondly, the defense spending should send a clear message to friend and foe alike that the United States of America is in this deal for the long haul, that when it comes to the defense of our freedom, when it comes to defending this country, there is no timeline until we get it right, that we are-that we will stay the course, we will stay-we owe that to our children. We owe it to our children and our children's children to defend freedom and to protect the homeland. It is a new era. We have new responsibilities in many ways-the same responsibilities, I guess, but new challenges to uphold those responsibilities, because we learned a tough lesson, and that is, oceans no longer protect us. It is a different war, with a different battlefield. And therefore, we must deal with threats as we see them, threats which may in the past have not been so frightening, but now in the new era we have got to deal with them, it seems like to me. In order to do our duty as Americans and leaders, we have got to defend our country and our friends and allies against the real threats that we face. And there is a grave threat in Iraq. There just is. This is a man who has gassed his own people, used weapons of mass destruction on his own citizens. Imagine what his intentions will be about a country that loves freedom like we do. This is a man who has attacked-and by the way, he used weapons of mass destruction in his own neighborhood, too, against countries on his border. This is a man who has attacked two countries in 22 years. This is a man who kills political dissenters in cold blood. This is a man who, 11 years ago, told the world that he would get rid of weapons of mass destruction, and yet, for 11 long years, he has defied resolution after resolution after resolution after resolution out of the United Nations. This is a man who would like nothing more than to team up with a terrorist network, a man who could use a terrorist network perhaps to use the weapons of mass destruction he is developed-and lies about-to harm countries that he cannot stand-America, Israel, countries in his own-immediately around him. And therefore, I thought it was time for us to deal with him, for the sake of freedom. So I went to the United Nations. And my message to the United Nations was this: We want you to succeed as a international body. The world is different. The threats are real. We can do a better job if we work together through the United Nations, and here is your chance to succeed. You have a choice, and the choice is whether you will be an effective peacekeeping organization or whether you will be like the League of Nations-your choice. I also said to Mr. Saddam Hussein, You said you would disarm-your choice to disarm. Military option is my last choice; it is not my first choice. This man should disarm, like he said. He should do what he said he would do. The United Nations should insist that he does what he said he would do. But for the sake of freedom and for the sake of peace, for the sake of a world that does not fear the world's worst leaders with the first world's weapons- with the world's worst weapons, this country will be deliberate, we will work with others, but we will lead a coalition to disarm Saddam Hussein. And today I was joined on the steps of the Rose Garden with Members of the House and Members of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike, who have joined with us to pass-the desire to pass a strong statement to the world about the resolve and determination of the United States. We are going to have a very constructive debate in Congress, and there should be. I told them today, I thought the debate that was going on is going to be one of the most historic debates ever in the Hall of Congress. That sentiment was echoed by not only the Speaker but Richard Gephardt, who was there, not only Trent Lott but Joe Lieberman was there, not only John McCain but Democrat Evan Bayh was there. Democrat and Republican alike joined hand-in-hand to send a clear message to the world: We love our peace; we want the world to be a better and more peaceful place. If the United States remains strong and tough and focused, we can achieve peace. We can achieve peace here at home. If we speak clearly and renounce terrorism and fight terrorism, we can achieve peace in the Middle East; we can achieve peace in South Asia. No, the enemy hit us. The enemy hit us. But they did not realize who they hit. Oh, they probably thought we'd file a lawsuit or two. But they hit a country which loves freedom, a country based upon solid values, a country which, when we need to be strong, is strong. And we need to be compassionate. We can be compassionate. I believe, sincerely believe, that out of the evil done to America can come incredible good, starting with peace. And I know we can be a better country. I know we can be a better country. We can work hard to make sure every child is educated. We can make sure to work- work hard to make sure our seniors get quality health care. Listen, medicine has changed; Medicare has not . Medicare is- medicine is modern. Medicare is ancient. For the sake of our seniors, let us modernize Medicare with prescription drugs. But we must remember, here in America, in spite of our plenty, there are pockets of despair-there just are. And there is pockets of hopelessness. There is places people are addicted; they are lonely. They wonder whether or not the American Dream means anything to them. And my attitude is-and I know it is Bob's attitude- so long as one hurt, we all hurt. And as a society, we must do everything we can to eradicate those pockets of despair. Now, listen-Government can hand out money. We are pretty good at it at times. But what Government cannot do is put hope in people's hearts or love in people's hearts or a sense of purpose in people's lives. Government cannot do that. That is done when our fellow Americans have heard the universal call to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. If you want to fight evil, do some good. If you want to fight evil, if you want to join in the war against terror, if you want to show the world what we are made out of-help somebody in need. See, our society will change-one heart, one conscience, one soul at a time-when a neighbor loves a neighbor in need. I look forward to working with Governor Ehrlich to unleash the true compassion of each society. I am a strong proponent of the Faith-Based Initiative. I want to unleash the power of love. I want people who go to church and synagogue and mosque, if they want to help a person in need, to be empowered by the Government to do so. Our Governments must not fear faith. We must welcome faith in our society. No, the enemy hit us, but they-in doing so, they have awakened a great spirit, an American spirit. And I want you all to help move that spirit forward. I know many of you already do this-but mentor a child, or help somebody in need. Continue doing the charitable works you do to help the communities in which you live. It will be a better place for all of us. One of the reasons I first ran for office is because I wanted to challenge the culture of our country, which has said, If it feels good, just go ahead and do it, and If you have got a problem, blame somebody else. My dream was to usher in a period of personal responsibility, to be a part of a cultural shift in which each of understands we are responsible for the decisions we make in life. If you are a mom or a dad, your most important responsibility is to love your child with all your heart. You are responsible for helping a neighbor in need. You are responsible for the quality of education in the community in which you live. If you are running corporate America, you are responsible to your employees and shareholders to tell the truth. And it is happening. The responsibility era is happening in America, probably most vividly displayed on Flight 93, when average citizens were flying across the country. They learned their plane was going to be used as a weapon- imagine. They got on the phone with their loved ones; they used the word love a lot. They said goodbye. They said a prayer. One guy said, Let us roll. They took the plane in the ground to serve something greater than themselves in life. I believe that is an important lesson for all of us to learn. Patriotism is more than putting your hand over your heart. Patriotism is serving your Nation. Patriotism is helping people in need. Patriotism is loving somebody just like you'd like to be loved yourself. No, the enemy hit us. But they did not know who they were hitting. They hit the greatest nation on the face of the Earth, and out of the evil done to America is going to come a peaceful world. And out of the evil done to America is going to continue to be a hopeful, compassionate, decent country. I am optimistic about our future, because I know America.

{"id": 970, "text": "Thank you very much for this cordial welcome this early in the morning. I appreciate it most highly. I remember how cordial you were when I came here in 1948, and I shall never forget it. I think I told you then about how my grandfather came out here with an ox train load of merchandise, and how Brigham Young helped him out. And since that time the records have been examined and the church files show that it actually happened just as I told it. He had the first train of his own loaded with merchandise for the Army, and when he got here the colonel in charge of the post had another freighter that he wanted to hold and he would not accept my grandfather's load of goods. And it almost broke him, and if it had not been for Brigham Young it would have broke him--but they worked it out and everybody was happy except the colonel in charge of the post. I have been making this trip to campaign for the Democratic Party. I am happy to do that, because I think you suspect by this time that I am a good Democrat. I believe with all my heart that it is in the best interests of the country for the Democrats to win this election. I think we are going to win it. We are going to win on the basis of our record, our platform, and our candidates. On each of these things, when you compare the Democratic situation with the Republican situation, the Democrats look so much better that there is no difficulty whatever to make a choice. First, take the record. The Democratic Party has been giving the country good government for the past 20 years. At home the country is in better shape than it ever has been. Abroad, we are making good progress in building up our defenses against the terrible threat of Communist aggression. At home and abroad, the Republican Party has been against almost every forward-looking proposal that we have made in these years. Now they are trying to rewrite history, but I am not going to let them get away with it. I have been reading the record on them, and I am going to keep it up, and tell the people exactly what the facts are. You see, nearly every place I go, somebody in the crowd around the street will let out a yell Give 'em hell, Harry. Well now, I do not strive for a reputation of that kind. I tell the truth on them, and that is a lot better for the country than giving them hell, because they cannot stand the truth. I hope every one of you will have an opportunity to read the Democratic platform, and the Republican platform, too. They will show you what the difference is between the two parties. I think we have the best platform any political party ever adopted, and think the Republican platform is about the worst one I ever read. Along with everything else they even endorsed that do-nothing 80th Congress. You remember it? Back in 1948 at Philadelphia, about 2:30 in the morning, I told the Democratic Convention that I was going to call a special session of Congress and see whether the Republicans in the 80th Congress would put their platform into effect. Oh, they had a platform that was intended to appeal to everybody in the country, so I called them together and they met for about 3 or 4 weeks and did not do a thing. I knew that was exactly what they would do--because they never do expect to carry out a platform even when it is good, but this one is so bad they cannot carry it out. If they were to win this election, you could count on them giving you the same sort of treatment you had from that 80th Congress-which won the election in 1948 for me. I told you when I was here in 1948 what the Republicans had been trying to do to your reclamation and power programs. They have been trying to do the same ever since-and you cannot trust them. The Democrats have it all over the Republicans in the case of candidates--just like we do everything else. And I do not know of any place where that is clearer than it is here in Utah. You have a fine Democratic candidate here for United States Senator--Waiter K. Granger. Walter K. Granger has made a wonderful record in Congress, and if you will send him to the Senate, you will have somebody there who will look out for your interests. Now I have known Mr. Granger for I do not know how long--15 or 18 years-and he has always been on the side of the people. You need a man like that in the Senate worse than ever now--I will say you need him from this State. For Congress you have Mrs. Reva Beck Bosone. Judge Bosone has also made a grand record in Congress. This is especially true on reclamation matters. If you send her back to Congress, and send Walt Granger to the Senate, you will have a very effective team to work for you on the reclamation projects that mean so much to this great western country. I also hope very much that you will promote your mayor, Earl Glade, to be Governor of this great State of Utah. I hope you will also send that good Democrat that was just introduced to you, Mr. McKay, to Congress. He impresses me as being a wonderful man. The best thing, you know, for your own safety, is to just vote the Democratic ticket and send them all in. I urge you most strongly to vote for our candidate for President and Vice President-Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. I think it would be a tragedy for the present Republican candidate to be elected President of the United States. He has been a great general, but he has already shown in this campaign that he cannot be depended on to master the great political issues with which we are faced. He has surrendered to the most reactionary elements of the Republican Party. He is not the kind of man we ought to have for President. Now I like him. I made him Chief of Staff of the United States Army. I sent him to Europe to command the NATO military setup, and I have every confidence in him as a military man. But as President and politician, he would not know what to do. Now, on the other hand, I am more than ever impressed each day with what Adlai Stevenson offers to the Nation. He is talking sense to the American people. He is wise. He is courageous. He is honest. He is a man you can trust. And he will not be taken in by any special interest lobby. If you elect him and a Democratic Congress, the country will be safe for another 4 years. Again I want to thank you very much for this most cordial welcome. I appreciate that greeting very, very much. I am glad to be back here in Helper once more. I was here in 1948 and gave you some down to earth facts about that good for-nothing, do-nothing Republican 80th Congress, if you remember. Then you did your duty at the polls, and I want to congratulate you on the way you voted. I understand Carbon County had the best record of any county in Utah in the vote you gave the Democratic Party in 1948. And I hope you will repeat that again. I am sure you will do it over in 1952, and send Adlai Stevenson to the White House. I have always been interested in the way your good town got its name. They tell me that Helper was named for the helper engines that pull the train up these wonderful mountains you have around here. You know, I think the Republican Party needs some helper engines. It would take a whole roundhouse full of these helpers to get them elected this fall, with their terrible record holding them back. As for their candidate for President, I do not think helper engines can get him out of the trouble he is in now. With the crew he has got around him, I do not think he will ever be elected. I just do not think the people are going to elect a President who has surrendered to Taft and McCarthy and Jenner and Kern. I am glad to come to your State and tell you that I am proud of the Democratic candidate for United States Senator. Utah has a wonderful man in Walter Granger. He has been one of the best Members of the House of Representatives for the past 12 years, and I know he is going to make a great United States Senator. Your candidate for the House of Representatives, Mr. Ernest McKay, knows the importance of using our national resources for the benefit of all the people, instead of just the special interests. I met Mr. Glade this morning, the present mayor of Salt Lake City--he was there to welcome me, and I understand he is going to be the next Governor of Utah. Now when you vote for President and Vice President, remember that this country has never had two better candidates than Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. They have shown by their record that they stand for the interests of the common everyday man.I want to tell you this, too. They are telling the truth in this campaign. They are not like some Republican politicians who are running around distorting the facts and trying to rewrite history. You can count on Stevenson and Sparkman to continue the prosperity you now have. You people here in Price Canyon area know the importance of steady employment. Twenty years ago, when the American people voted the Republicans out of office, there were 12 to 14 million people out of work in this country. But today our country is working full blast, with over 62 million people in good jobs. I told the students up at the Brigham Young University in Provo this morning that in 1932 when they were graduating, they did not know where to go for jobs. There were 14 million people out of jobs, and the graduates of that university would be lucky if they got a job at a dollar a day. And then I read them an extract from a piece in the San Francisco Chronicle about the graduation of last June from colleges, in which it was said the students now have so many jobs to pick from, they do not know which one to take. Now I think you had better keep up that situation. And the reason you can do that is because the Democratic Party has courage. This thing did not come about by accident. The Democratic Party has had the courage, the wisdom, and the faith to make our economy work in a way that all Americans, not just a special few, could enjoy prosperity and full employment. Our policy is for the people. You will find that the Republican policy is always a property interest. The Democratic Party's policy is the welfare and benefit of all the people, not just a few. Compare the terrible Republican record and the terrible Republican platform this year with the Democratic record and with the Democratic platform this year, and you cannot possibly go wrong because you will vote the Democratic ticket. Study them carefully. You will only come to one conclusion. Vote the Democratic ticket. Vote your own interests--that is what you are doing. You see, the power of the Government in this country is in the people, and the people exercise that power by voting. You go to the polls and vote for your own interests--vote for the welfare of this great Nation, and vote for peace in the world, by voting the Democratic ticket, and the country will be safe for another 4 years.Thank you a lot. Thank you. I appreciate it very much--very much indeed this introduction, and I am particularly happy over that synthetic truth brigade that is supposed to be following me. You know, I was shadowed in 1948 by somebody, and now I am being shadowed again. You know what is the trouble? We are telling the truth on them, and that really hurts. I am here in one of my many jobs--campaigning as a leader of the Democratic Party. It is good to come to a Democratic place like this. You gave me a good big majority in 1948. You have been Democratic since 1932. You have a good Democrat representing you in Congress--Wayne Aspinall. Keep him there. He is an excellent man. Awhile ago when I heard your national committeeman introduce John Metzger, I did not know who he was talking about. I know him as Bill, and I think he is all right, and he will make you a good Governor. I have known him a long, long time. Bill is a go-getter, and he will be an asset to Colorado and to you. Now I want to call your attention particularly to our candidates for President and Vice President. I do not think that we have ever had abler men to head the Democratic ticket than we have in Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. They are both men of experience in government. They are both liberal-minded gentlemen, and they will carry on this great Government of ours in the manner in which it ought to be carried on. And you must elect them in November. I am glad to see the great progress this area is making. I have been reading a copy of your good newspaper just as I came along here. You know, it is a grand paper. I have been in politics for 30 years, and in elective public office for 30 years, and down in Missouri there are 7 metropolitan papers, and I never had one for me in my whole life. If they did get for me, I would know I was wrong. I wish we had newspapers like that in Missouri. We need them. In most places I visit, the newspapers are against the Democrats. Now, why that is I do not know. And against the plain people, generally. But your paper is a good one, and I am happy to say that about your newspaper. Your paper told of the progress you are making--when most papers keep telling the people how bad things are. If you listen to most of them, you would think the country is just on the verge of ruin. Well now, here is the quotation from your good paper: There are more animals in the county this year, as compared with last; there are more acres of bearing orchard and more acres of meadow hay; people own more household furniture; stocks of merchandise are greater; there is more farm equipment, except combines; there has been a great deal of building and improvements; and mining is on the increase. Well now, that is an awful situation for the Republicans to have to swallow in a campaign year. In addition to this, I understand you have a fine new veterans hospital here that will be of great value to this whole area. I congratulate you on that record. You are especially fortunate here, but we are having the same sort of situation all over the United States.This prosperity of ours is driving the Republican politicians almost crazy. That is the reason for those four little men following me. They cannot stand to see the country so well off under a Democratic administration. I was reading a speech by the Republican candidate for President the other day. He was doing his best to prove that this prosperity did not exist--that it was all done with mirrors, according to him. And at the end he said: Do you want to stand still, mired in the mud of this New Deal prosperity, or do you want to march down the shining corridor of progress to the Republican idea of prosperity? Well, what do you think? I know what I think, and I know I am pouring it on them so you will not have to. Do you want to march off under the orders of the Republican general, down that shining corridor --whatever that is--or would you just as soon stay behind, stuck in the mud of this terrible New Deal prosperity ? The last time the Republicans marched off with us we were a long time getting back where we belonged. Today is the first day of your community chest drive, and I hope you will take a little of that prosperity and give it to help others who need it. That is the American program. One of the things that the Republicans are saying is that this prosperity is due to the defense program, and to the fighting in Korea. That is not true. Do not you believe it. If we did not have the defense program, we would be even more prosperous. We would have a lot of things that we are holding back on now, because of defense. That is true of the atomic energy programs, too. We are developing peaceful uses for the atom--like the submarine I started last summer in Connecticut, that has an atomic engine in it. If it were not for defense, we could go ahead much faster with the peaceful uses of the atom, and of the uranium that you are mining around here in this State. They tell me that the independent uranium producers who are doing so much to get this ore out, are running into difficulties with existing Government procedures. I am going to look into that matter when I get back to Washington and see if it cannot be straightened out, and in a way that will give the little fellow a square break. I am always for the little man. You will find that that is a Democratic policy. If you look over the Republican policy, you will find that they are for property. The Democratic policy is for people. I think the people come first, then the property will take care of itself. We are working for peace. That is what our defense program is for. And with God's help we will get it. Then we will be even more prosperous. At least, we will have more prosperity if you do not elect the Republicans so they can bring on another depression. Your Government under the Democratic Party has worked with you to create the prosperity we now have--and we will keep on doing just that. One of the things we hope to do in the future is this Upper Colorado River storage project. This will do a tremendous lot for the whole area. The Secretary of the Interior is working on the planning of this project now, so that the dams can be built in such a way as not to damage the Dinosaur National Monument. I think that Dinosaur National Monument ought to be preserved. In fact, it ought to be enlarged. After this election, we will enlarge it to accommodate the dinosaur wing of the whole Republican Party. We will fill it up with the old Republican fossils. Then maybe we could change the name of it to the Republican National Dinosaur Monument. They are still living so far in the past that they never in the world will catch up with the progress of this great Nation of ours. You cannot count on the Republicans to continue the progress we are making. They are always obstructing measures for the good of the people. And I want you to do something for me. I want you to get out the record and read it, find out just how many projects they tried to sabotage, find out their record on everything that has been for the welfare and benefit of this country; and you will find that the majority of the Republicans in Congress were against them every single time. If you read the record, you will not have any trouble whatever about making up your mind. Now, that record is hard to read. It is in fine print, and it is the dullest document that was ever published in the history of the world. But it has the facts and the figures in it, and if you are interested in the welfare of your country, you will read that record, and then you will vote for yourselves on election day. Because it is you that is affected. You are the Government. The people of this country have the power that makes the Government. And when you exercise that franchise, you put the people in there who are to run your Government. And when you do not vote, and when you do not do your duty, you get just the kind of government you deserve. Now, do not forget, on November the 4th, go to the polls and vote for Adlai Stevenson, and this whole Democratic ticket here in Colorado and the country will be safe another 4 years. I appreciate very much that welcome, You know, when I was here in 1948, we just went through. I would not let them do it this time, because I wanted particularly to tell that band how much I appreciated them getting up at 4 o'clock and coming to serenade the President down here a few miles to the next stop. The group showed a real and unselfish interest in the Government. If the voters of Colorado and those of the country exercised the patriotism and initiative of young people like these, we would not have to urge constantly that they exercise their right to vote. Everybody ought to take it on himself to vote. That is his patriotic duty. There has been a rumor going around that I am out doing some campaigning for the Democratic ticket. Well, I am. That is my privilege as head of the Democratic Party. I am trying to tell you what the facts are and I want you to use your own judgment. That seems to worry a lot of the Republicans for some reason. I just want to tell them this is only the beginning. A lot more of them will be worried before I finish reading the terrible Republican record to the American people from one end of this country to the other. I am out here because I believe that world peace, domestic prosperity, and the principles of justice and decency will be served better by the election of a Democratic ticket. That is just what you are going to do on the 4th of November. Here in this district, you have been ably represented by Congressman Wayne Aspinall. He has done a good job for western Colorado, and I know you will elect him again for another term. I have known Bill Metzger for many, many years. He will make you a good Governor, one that you will be proud of, and I hope you will elect him, too--and I know you will. This year the Democratic Party has at the head of the ticket two of the best candidates this country has ever produced--Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. Stevenson and Sparkman understand the problems of the little fellow, and they understand the problems of the West. They know that locked in the hills of western Colorado you have some of the most valuable natural resources to be found any place in the Nation. They know that these resources must be developed for all the people, and not just for the special interests. An example of the way to do this is the Bureau of Mines project for developing gasoline and oil products from coal and oil shale. There are about a thousand square miles in this area north and west of Rifle where beds of oil shale, hundreds of feet thick, will yield an average of 15 gallons or more of oil per ton of shale. This project promises to open up a vast new era of industrial expansion. This is a wonderful example of the way the Government can undertake experimental work and develop resources from which all the people will benefit. But the Republicans are wildly running around the country trying to fool the people into believing that projects like these are socialism. They say the power dams, reclamation projects, and the whole development of this mountain area should not be carried forward by your own Government for your own benefit. And now the Republican candidate has caved in to the power lobby. He is going around, too, claiming that the Government projects represent a philosophy of the left -whatever that is--and that they are regimenting people and destroying liberty. Well, I have been looking into this subject as I have traveled around the country for the past 8 days, and I have met thousands of wonderful people, and I have not seen anybody in slavery. Nobody has complained to me about having his liberty destroyed. So, do not be fooled by this gloomy poppycock the Republicans are spreading. Vote for the party that believes in you, and believes in the future development and the prosperity of this great country. You yourselves are the Government of this country. The people are the Government, and the way they exercise the powers of government is at the polls on election day. It is your duty to go to the polls and vote for yourselves. Vote for your own interest. Vote for the welfare of this great Nation. Vote for peace in the world. Vote for Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman, and the whole Democratic ticket, and you will have 4 more years of good government all across the country.Thank you very much. Thank you--thank you very much. I appreciate that, and I am greatly enjoying this trip through Colorado. You know, when I was here before in 1948, it was 7:30 in the morning, and I did not think anybody would be up at that time of day, but the people turned out. They wanted to hear the facts and they wanted to listen--and I see you are doing it better at this time of day, and I appreciate it more than I can tell you. I have enjoyed the visit with your Congressman, Wayne Aspinall, about your progress out here, and your problems. Be sure and send him back to Congress because he has Colorado's interests at heart, and he does his job as well as any Congressman in the Congress. And I would like very much to see you vote for John William Metzger. I have known him a long time, and he is a good man and he will make you a good Governor. My principal interest in being out here, however, is to get you to understand some of the issues of this campaign, and understand also that the Democrats have nominated a man to head the ticket, and a man for Vice President--two men who are unbearable so far as ability and honor and everything else is concerned--they will never have better candidates for the Office of President than Adlai Stevenson, and John Sparkman. You will make no mistake voting for them. I am not running for office this time--I did not know whether you knew that or not-but I am going to leave the Government of the United States in good hands. Adlai Stevenson is one of the best qualified men ever to run for President. He has been a great Governor of a great State, and he has a lot of experience in foreign affairs. John Sparkman is one of the best men that the Senate has ever had there--and I spent 10 years in the Senate myself, so you know I am paying him a high compliment.One of the things that is most important to your progress and prosperity out here is the Federal program of reclamation and power projects. I have been telling the people in the West that the Republican Party is against these projects, and I have been exposing the record, showing how the Republicans in Congress have voted to hinder and obstruct and slash appropriations for these great dams and irrigation systems and powerlines. A Republican spokesman piped up the other day, and said this was unfair--that a Republican started the reclamation program. That is right, it was a Republican-Theodore Roosevelt, back in 1902, who started it. He was a Republican who had a great sympathy for the West. And you know what happened to him? He was thrown out of the Republican Party by the Wall Street bankers. He had to go out and set up a party of his own--the Bull Moose party. And the special interest groups have run the Republican Party ever since. The Republican Party always kicks out its liberals, or whips them into line. I could tell you a lot about this, and I will before this campaign is over. The reason the Republican Party cannot really be in favor of reclamation and public power, is that they let the private power lobby write their policies for them. The private power lobby has been spending millions of dollars to persuade the people that everything from TVA to Boulder Dam is creeping socialism. So naturally, the Republicans have to call it the same thing. But it is not. It is a good American program of developing the resources of the people for the benefit of the people. And the Democratic Party has been doing things through Congress, and getting it done, in spite of the Republican opposition. One of the best things for this whole part of Colorado would be the proposed Colorado River storage project. It would bring more electric power and new and bigger industries to this area. It would mean thousands of acres of new irrigated land, and more water for farms. The plans for this project are just about complete. They are being drawn up in the Department of the Interior, under the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Oscar Chapman. I do not have to tell you people here in Colorado about your fellow citizen, Oscar Chapman. He is one of the greatest friends the people of the West ever had. After Oscar Chapman has approved these plans for the Upper Colorado River storage project, they come to the White House. They have to be approved by the President, and then they go to Congress. Now, I will not be President when that project gets to the White House, and I cannot make any promises for the man who will be there; but I can tell you this, if Governor Stevenson is the President, it will be considered on its merits and decided in the best interests of the people. And his decision will not be dictated by the private power lobby. And that is a lot more than I can say for the Republican candidate. I am afraid he might say that this project is applying the philosophy of the left to the Government--and it might help the housewife get the dishes washed--so he will be against it. And that is what he has been saying about some of the Government dams and power projects that are under construction and have been built in these areas. If you want that Upper Colorado storage project, you had better vote Democratic. Some of you were a little careless up here in 1948, and did not vote the Democratic ticket. But you had better be more careful this time. The situation is of vital importance to the welfare of the country, and I tell all the people, when I talk to them, that their interests are at stake. You yourselves are the ones who have the interest in this election. When you vote on November the 4th you vote for yourselves, because you are the Government. You either vote for progress, you either vote for the improvement of the resources of this country and for the benefit of the people, or you vote against yourselves, you vote for a backward-looking crowd who do not believe in the things that have made this great West great. Consider these things, and on election day use your own good judgment. For your own best interests, vote the Democratic ticket straight, and then the country will be safe another 4 years for the welfare and benefit of the Nation as a whole, and for the people that make up the Nation.Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsrearplatformremarksutahandcolorado", "title": "Rear Platform Remarks in Utah and Colorado", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/rear-platform-remarks-utah-and-colorado", "publication_date": "06-10-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S Truman"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 836, "text": "Thank you. Let me say, first of all, I thank you for that. I am profoundly moved. And I was thinking when I was watching David Mixner make those remarks that 30 years ago, when I let him sleep on my floor when we were much younger men in England, and I did not charge him a nickel for it I never dreamed that either of us would be in this place tonight doing these things. David's life has taken a lot of twists and turns since then. He is had his ups and his downs like all the rest of us. But I can tell you something, when I met him when he was young, I thought I had never met a person whose heart burned with the fire of social justice so strongly. He has never forgotten the roots of his childhood. He has never forgotten not only the pain that he and other gay and lesbian Americans have endured; he also cares for other people who are dispossessed and downtrodden and underrepresented and often forgotten. And tonight I was watching him, and he introduced his wonderful sister who has also been a friend of mine for nearly 30 years now and I was thinking how fortunate we are in this country at this time, with all the things we have had to do, to have had his energy, his heart, his devotion, his passion. It was 8 years ago that he and Scott Hitt and a few other ANGLE members met with me this week 8 years ago, here. Then in May of '92 we had a big event out here, and some of you were there. And I told you that I had a vision of America, and you were part of it, that we were all part of the same community. Well, tonight I thank you for helping to make that happen. I thank my good friend Governor Gray Davis for the leadership he has given in California. I thank our leader in the House of Representatives, who when David made that crack about the Canterbury Tales and how we are known by our traveling companions it kind of made me feel sorry for Dick Gephardt. You talk about a guy that gets up and goes to work every day under adverse conditions and continues to do the right thing, he does. But I know that Representatives Baldwin and Becerra and Kennedy and Sherman and Waxman are here, and they are his good fellow travelers. We just may need five more in the company to make it a much better trip. I want to thank Bill Melamed, Skip Paul, Gwen Baba, Roberta Bennett for putting this together. I want to thank the members of our administration who came: Sean Maloney, Karen Tramontano, Minyon Moore, Fred Hochberg, Richard Socarides, Marsha Scott. And I want to thank Scott Hitt, especially, who is been the Chair of the AIDS council. He is having his last meeting as Chair on Monday, and he is been magnificent, and we ought to give him a big hand. I'd also like to thank the Gay Men's Chorus. I was back there feverishly trying to write down all those lines. I want to call Hillary and give her those best lines tonight. You know, I am trying to remember them all. It was unbelievable. If someone would furnish me with the lyrics of that song, I would be eternally grateful. You know, I'd like to put what brought us all here tonight just for a minute. I know a lot of other people are going to speak and have a lot of great things to say, but I would like to put this in, just for a moment, in the context of history and the larger context of our future, and how the fight for equal rights and equal opportunity and full participation to build one America fits in with all the other things we should be doing as a country, and how what we are at home will determine what we can do around the world in the new millennium. When I ran for President in 1992, most Americans felt things were pretty dismal in this country. The economy was in bad shape; the society was divided; all the social indicators crime, welfare, and other things were going in the wrong direction. Politics was, as we all remember from the convention they had back then on the other side, a matter of division, you know, just drive a wedge in society and make sure your wedge is bigger than their wedge; you get more votes, you win; and if everybody is all torn up and upset, who cares, you are in power. And over and over and over again, things in Washington were sort of repeating themselves like a broken record. And I felt that we could do better with a unifying vision. That is why I set out a vision of America, and you were part of it. But I also had a vision that we could build an economy that was good for working people and employers. I believed we could build a country where we could grow the economy and make the environment better, not worse. I have always believed that the real purpose of life and growth is to try and figure out how to develop these unifying visions and to move closer to them and to break down all these funny walls we have to put up in our minds to organize life into little boxes so we can figure out how to get from here to there. And, you know, in '92, the American people just sort of took a chance on me and Al Gore. I mean, it was an argument we made and there was no evidence for it because the other crowd had been in so long. We just made an argument. And it was not an easy race. A month after we had that meeting out here in May of '92, I won the California primary. And the headline the next day was that the exit poll showed that all the people that voted for me really wanted Ross Perot to be President. And I was in third place. And then he and President Bush got in a fight about who messed up whose daughter's wedding or something. You remember that? I mean, it was an amazing and I thought to myself, people do not have jobs; they are being foreclosed on; why are you guys fighting about this? The wedding went off without a hitch. What is this about? And somehow the American people decided to give me a chance, decided to give Al and Hillary and Tipper and all the people that came in the administration a chance. I guess what I'd like to say tonight, first of all not with arrogance, but with humility is that we now know that there is evidence that we are right and that pulling things together and moving forward actually works. We have the lowest unemployment in 29 years, the lowest welfare rolls in 32 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest crime rates in 26 years, the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years, the highest homeownership in history, the longest peacetime expansion in history. And you have to 15 million Americans took leave under the family leave law. And when it was vetoed in the previous administration, they said, Oh, well, we have got to veto this bill because if we let people take time off from work when their babies are born or their parents are sick, why, it will ruin the small business economy. And every year, we have set a new record for new small businesses in America. Ninety percent of our kids are immunized against serious diseases for the first time, our young children. We are giving 5 million more of them health insurance. A hundred thousand young people served in AmericCorps. I could just go on and on. And along the way, we gave America the most diverse, truly representative government by far in the history of America. That included you and everybody else. What I want to say to you is, this is not an argument anymore. We have evidence. And so you should be of good cheer. And when you look ahead to these elections in 2000, you should be absolutely sure that anybody who is not with you knows they are doing it in the face of the evidence. And because what really bothers me about what is going on in Washington now, it is like there are all these people out there making decisions in the congressional majority as if the last 6 1/2 years just did not happen. And that bothers me. So I say to you, when they say, looking at the Vice President and our party, Well, America needs a change, I agree with that. America always needs a change. We have got a lot more to do on your agenda. America needs a change. The question is not whether we will change, but how are we going to change? How are we going to change? You mark my words, the world is changing so fast in how we work and live and relate to each other and folks around the globe, that the world will change. The question is, how? And are we going to use this unprecedented moment, the chance of a lifetime to say, okay, what are our big challenges out there, and seize them? Or are we going to do what got us into so much trouble in the first place? Are we going to pretend that the last 6 1/2 years just did not happen? That is very important. And I want to try to put the things that you are thinking about now into that context. What are the really big challenges facing America that affect you, too? One, the aging of America I hate it because I am doing it. But I am the oldest of the baby boomers. The number of people over 65 will double in the next 30 years; there will be two people working for every one person retired and drawing Social Security. Now, we have never been in a position, until now, in my lifetime, to deal with that challenge. But we now have the ability to run the life of Social Security out 50 years, to add more than a decade to the life of Medicare, to cover prescription drugs for elderly people threequarters of them cannot afford quality prescription drugs today and to do it in a way that all of you who are younger than that should rejoice about. Because I can tell you those of us in the baby boom generation are plagued by the notion that our retirement will be so expensive for our country that it will burden our children and our ability to give our grandchildren the childhoods they deserve. But we can fix it now. So I gave them a plan to do it. So far, they say no. Another thing that really bothers me: we have got the largest and most diverse group of children in our school in history. We never had over 53 million children in schools, and they come from more different backgrounds than ever before. And that will be a godsend to 21st century America if, but only if, they all have a world-class education. And I think they are entitled to it. So I gave Congress a plan to build and modernize 6,000 schools and hire 100,000 teachers for smaller classes; make sure all the kids had computers in their classrooms; make sure we stopped social promotion, but had after-school programs for the kids who needed it; and more of these charter schools that California has led the way in bringing to our children. So far, they said no. Funny thing, maybe Mr. Gephardt will talk about this later, but one of the most interesting things is last year, right before the election in '98, they got religion on this education program. And they supported this big downpayment on our plan for 100,000 teachers, and we funded 30,000 of those teachers. And you had those real liberals, like Mr. Armey going home. This is serious business; ask Dick. You had these real liberals going out and saying, Man, this is a great thing we have done. We have made a big downpayment on 100,000 teachers; we are going to put 30,000 teachers out there, and this is a great Republican program because there is no bureaucracy in it. We just give it to the schools, and they hire the teachers. They thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread before the election. They have just voted not only to refuse to fund any more of those but to no longer earmark the money for the 30,000. So there is a big difference here. I am worried about the families of our country. I am worried about all these working people. How are they going to have the child care they need? How are they going to have the health care they need? Why do not we pass the Patients' Bill of Rights that protects working people? There is a difference between the two parties on that, and I think it is important. We are finally going to get a chance we have been working for 2 years finally going to get a chance to vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House next week. I am very worried about this fabulous economy, because we have left some people behind. Yes, we have got the lowest poverty rate in 20 years, but there are still people in places that have not felt this recovery. If you come from a lot of you come from other places, the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, the Indian reservations, many of the inner cities. So I want to do some things that I think will change all that. I want to, first of all, give Americans with money the same incentives to invest in poor areas in America we give them to invest in poor areas around the world. I think that is important. I hope in the near future we will be able to make access to the Internet as universal as telephone access is. It will have a huge impact on the economy. Last night I was in northern California, and I was with some people who work with eBay. A lot of you probably buy things on eBay. It seems like everybody does now. And I learned that over and above the employees of that company, there are now over 20,000 people, including a lot of people that used to be on welfare, who actually make a living buying and selling things, trading on eBay, over 20,000 people. Well, I am telling you, that means nothing at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where the unemployment rate is 73 percent. Now, we can do better. And we ought not to quit until every American has the chance to participate in our prosperity if he or she is willing to work. And I will not rest until that happens. I want you to keep a checklist in your mind, and when I get to the end, ask yourself what is all this about, what is it got to do with you as Americans? This is part of being part of America. I think we need to do more, not less, for the environment. The Vice President has this livability agenda to deal with, using all kinds of computer technology to alleviate traffic congestion, to buy more green space in urban areas. We are trying to lead the world toward recognizing that this global warming is real, but that you do not have to end your economic growth, because now there are technologies available to allow us to grow the economy as we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. There are people in the other party who believe that this is some sort of subversive plot to wreck America's economic future. Not very long ago, I came out here and went to San Bernardino, to the Inland Empire, and we announced a housing development for low income working people in which the developers pledged, by the use of energy conservation technologies, to cut the utility bills of these low income working people by 40 percent. And I just got a report that the average reduction is 60 percent. That is good for the economy. That is not bad for the economy, and it is good for the environment. Let me just mention a couple of other things. I am very concerned that America, even though we have got the lowest crime rate in 26 years, is still a pretty dangerous country compared to other countries. We should be the safest big country in the world. This is a free and prosperous place. We welcome all kinds of people. It is not rational. Why are not we the safest country in the world? Because we have not taken reasonable steps, not enough of them, to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. And because, frankly, even though we have put 100,000 more police on the street in community policing, we have still got neighborhoods that do not have enough coverage. So I gave Congress a plan to deal with both those things: put 50,000 more police officers out there to prevent crime in the highest crime areas of the country and to deal with guns and so forth. They say no. Our crowd says yes; their crowd says no. Big difference. What about our role in the world? I have tried, from Bosnia to Kosovo to the Middle East to Northern Ireland, to stand up for the idea that people ought not to be murdered or moved wholesale because of their race or their religion. We have worked to support other countries and to build the capacity in Africa to prevent future Rwandas, because people ought not to be murdered because of what tribe they are in. And you can define tribe however you want. We are about to start a great debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to end nuclear testing, something that Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy wanted us to do years ago. We are finally going to have a chance to do it. In so many of these areas, there are partisan differences which surprise me. And let me come back to you. Why are we for the hate crimes legislation? Why are we for ENDA? Because if we cannot build one America, it is going to be very hard to have a unifying force that will deal with every other one of these issues. And that is what I want you to think about. Do not you think that it is interesting that here we are on the verge of this new millennium with all these absolutely breathtaking technological breakthroughs that people who are technologically challenged, like me, can hardly keep up with? I mean, is not it amazing to you that we have modernity is bursting out all over in the form of high technology. And yet, the world's largest problem and America's largest problem, that you can see when those kids got shot at that Jewish school and that Filipino postalworker was murdered here; that you could see when that guy who said he belonged to a church that did not believe in God but did believe in white supremacy killed all those people of color and wounded others in Illinois and Indiana; that you could see when Matthew Shepard was murdered and James Byrd was torn apart; and that you can see in the tribal slaughters of Rwanda, and the persecution of the Kosovar Albanians or the Bosnian Muslims or the fights in Northern Ireland or the continued agonies of the Middle East here we are on the verge of this great modern world, where we can make movies with virtual reality now, and virtual reality seems sometimes more real than what is real, and the biggest problem we have got is the primitive, ageold fear and hatred and dehumanization of the other people who are not like us. And so I say I am nearly done; I just want to say this I am going to do everything I can, every day that I have, to remind people of that, that we have to be one America. We can have honest differences over issues, but we cannot have honest differences about whether we share a common humanity. And we cannot be under the illusion that either material prosperity or technological breakthroughs alone can purge the darkness in our hearts. I believe that America's best days are still out there. I believe with all my heart that we can find a way to marry prosperity and peace and humanity. But we must have a unifying vision. I want to say, again, I am grateful to people who have worked in my administration who have made me more alive to the concerns of your community, not only those who themselves are gay and lesbian, but others, beginning with my Vice President, who has been terrific on all of that in ways you will never know. But people are still scared of people who are not like them. And other people are scared of themselves, and they are afraid they will not count unless they have got somebody to look down on. And if you have to find somebody to look down on, it must be somebody that is different from you. Because if you look down on somebody who is just like you, then you are looking down on yourself. And so we, in our little minds, come up with all these boxes. But all of life is a struggle to find a more and more and more and more unifying vision that, at least for me, makes us both more human and more in tune with our maker. I wish I could have done better. But we have done pretty well. And we are a long way from where we were. But I want you to think about this a little bit every day between now and next year, 13 months until the millennial election to define what America will be like; whether we will continue to embrace these big challenges and change in a positive way, building on what we now have evidence of; whether we will continue to look for those unifying visions that allow us all to join hands and go forward together. And I want you to remember the enthusiasm with which you greeted me tonight. And I want you to remember that it is easy to shout in the moment. But the world is turned by those who day in and day out, with courage and determination and heart and hope, stay the course. We need you. America needs you. I still believe in the future of America, and you are a part of it. Thank you, and God bless you.

{"id": 779, "text": "Governor Curley, Mr. Mayor, my friends of Boston. I return to the New England from which came most of my ancestors. I come from visiting many other States. Hardly one among them has not received men and treasure, brawn and brains, from New England's inexhaustible reserves. The average American as I have met him on these voyages is no longer indifferent to the problems of Government. And it is my opinion that there is more downright political intelligence than ever before in our entire history. In a world which in many places has gone undemocratic, we have gone more democratic. It is a bad sign for those who believe that the American people can be swept off their feet by rabble-rousers this year. The American mind today is above the rabble level. Two weeks from today, the day after election, the American air will be cleaner and American democracy will be safer. I want to speak to you briefly and simply about the prosperity of all the Nation, for in that prosperity all New England has an immediate and a direct interest. The golden State House dome symbolizes in itself the preservation of the political unity of the Nation. But New England is heir to the lasting fruits of another great New England tradition-the tradition of being a part in the economic development of the entire Union, and of sharing in all of its prosperity. In the most immediate sense, the problems of the great population of the West and South are your problems too. Their welfare and prosperity are your welfare and prosperity. The sale of New England's shoes depends in part on the price of Kansas' wheat and Georgia's cotton. Prosperity for the California fruit grower depends in part on the prosperity of the New England textile mill. New England savings have prospered in developing Western mines and railroads and stockyards and farms. I have thought much of this interdependence as I have traveled through the great Western country. And I am confident that level-headed New England knows how true that is, knows it in spite of a cantankerous minority that in every difficult time has found spokesmen to try to persuade New England that its interest is not the interest of the rest of the Union. They tell New England today as they have told it before that it has been ruined by Government policies designed to benefit only the rest of the Union. We all know that New England has had its troubles. We all know that New England is coming out of its troubles. If you need figures to prove that, here they are for the State of Massachusetts: Payrolls for the first half of 1936 are up 32 percent over the first half of 1933. Retail sales are up 20 percent. Farm income, excluding benefit payments, is up 37 1/2 percent. Building construction in sixty-two Massachusetts cities is up 100 percent. Does that look to you like the end of private enterprise? For many years under Republican Administrations, New England was handicapped. What were the causes? Every realistic business man of New England knows. First: That New England had established standards of wages and of living which put some of its industries at a competitive disadvantage with sections of the country which had not reached those standards. Second: That those lower standards were exploited by an absentee landlordism which exported from New England too much of its capital-capital that was used elsewhere to compete with industries at home. Third: Concentrated wealth and economic power gobbled up or wiped out or moved away hundreds of small independent New England businesses-the kinds of businesses with which at one time New England had conquered the markets of the world. What did Republican leadership do to meet those difficulties? A high protective tariff alone could not help New England meet the unfair competition from domestic competitors on the one hand, and the unfair competition of monopoly on the other. To make matters worse, that tariff shut off the foreign commerce on which the sea coast population and industrial population of New England had lived. The full fruit of these Republican policies of twelve years is found in the record of what happened to New England's industries under those policies. New England was engulfed by the depression five years before the rest of the country. That is New England's debt to the Republican leadership of the boom era. What has this Administration done? We have raised wages and living standards in other sections of the country. They are being brought up toward the standards of New England. That kind of unfair competition is being destroyed. Most of us are in favor of that. We have begun the first real offensive in our history against that concentrated wealth and monopolistic power which almost destroyed the small businesses and diversified industries of New England. Most of us are in favor of that. By reciprocal trade agreements, we have begun to reopen foreign markets for New England products and New England shipping and trade. Most of us are in favor of that. We have increased the purchasing power of New England's customers out on the farms and in the cities of the Nation. And most of us are in favor of that. New England has traditionally been a land of moderate-sized independent business, a land of economic democracy. Its farseeing statesmen have always understood that democracy was impossible under the relentless pressure of concentration and monopoly wielded by the new power of high finance. The New England Puritan spirit of simplicity, the New England passion for democracy, the New England genius for democratic statescraft, are the very sources of that program of this Administration which set itself to end such concentration of wealth and economic power. Daniel Webster spoke for all that was wisest in New England when he said at Plymouth Rock: The freest Government, if it could exist, would not be long acceptable, if the tendency of the laws were to create a rapid accumulation of property in few hands, and to render the great mass of the population dependent and penniless. Universal suffrage could not long exist in a community where there was great inequality of property. What have we done in our fight against monopolies? We have taxed the intercorporate dividends of holding companies. We have graduated taxes on corporations according to income, just as taxes on individuals were graduated long ago. We have made it harder for big corporations to retain the huge undistributed profits with which they gobble up small business. We have raised the surtaxes on big incomes and the estate taxes on big fortunes. We have regulated the financial markets through which mergers and consolidations and monopolies are created with other people's money. Way back in 1776 John Adams wrote to his friend Patrick Henry: The decree is gone forth, and it cannot be recalled, that a more equal liberty than has prevailed in other parts of the earth, must be established in America. The exuberance of pride which has produced an insolent domination in a few, a very few, opulent monopolizing families, will be brought down nearer to the confines of reason and moderation, than they have been used to. I am glad to travel in the company of John Adams and Daniel Webster. Boston and Massachusetts and New England have not lost the spirit that has made the Nation great.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbostonmass", "title": "Address at Boston, Mass.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-boston-mass", "publication_date": "21-10-1936", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 600, "text": "Thank you all very, very much. And I am just delighted to be with you today to celebrate the work of those wonderful Americans we call Points of Light. And I think our First Lady is a Point of Light. So I salute her for what she is done in literacy and helping this country understand the importance of reading. There is another guy here who is been a personal Point of Light to me, and that is Gregg Petersmeyer, who many of you know. In a sense it was his dream and his dedication that made all this possible. And Joe and Jenny, your witnessing, your testimony really makes this speech superfluous. I do not need to do it, but I will anyway. But thank you. You said it all with your own lives. I also want to thank the leaders of three new institutions that have been established in the last 4 years: Tom Ehrlich of the Commission on National and Community Service, Dick Munro of the Points of Light Foundation, and Solon Cousins of the National Center for Community Risk Management and Insurance. And I also want to thank my friends: Ray Chambers, what an inspiration he has been in this whole voluntarism concept; Pete McCloskey; also George Romney, who I hope is here with us today. But we are grateful. What an honor it is to have Larnelle here, Larnelle Harris, for helping make this event so very special. Anybody that can get up without a pitch pipe or a band and do what he did, we have got to look them over and see what makes him tick. But I will tell you, his song said it all; his song got right to the heart. And I understand that he is just been nominated for his seventh Grammy Award. And Presidents ought not to do this, but I know who I am rooting for. So there we are. But above all, Barbara and I wanted to come over and thank the Points of Light that we are honoring today. I know that many of them have gone to great efforts to get here. And lots of folks ask me about the phrase, Points of Light. And some say it is religion; others say, well, it is a patriotic theme, like the flag; and others think it is an image of hope. But I think that Points of Light are all of these things and yet still something more. It is what happens when ordinary people claim the problems of their community as their own. And it is the inspiration and awakening to the God-given light from within, lit from within, and it is the promise of America. We have got Points of Light here today from all 50 States, shining all the way from Anchorage to Harlem, Miami to Maine. And never before has there been so much light in this marvelous house. Each of you here today knows what I mean by that. Each of you found within yourselves your own special genius for helping others. And each discovered the imagination to see things that others could not: the human dignity in the eyes of a homeless man; the musicians and business leaders in an inner-city gang; the light and laughter in the shadows of a shattered life. I have always believed that in each individual, there is a Point of Light waiting to be revealed; in each community, a thousand miracles waiting to happen. And when I assumed this great office, I pledged to do all I could to honor, encourage, and increase volunteer efforts until their light filled every dark corner of our country. We began with a national strategy. And if you will bear with me, I'd like to remind you of what that strategy is: first, changing attitudes so that all Americans define a successful life as one that includes serving others; and second, identifying what is already working so that those efforts can be enlarged and multiplied; and third, encouraging leaders to help others become Points of Light; and fourth, reducing volunteer liability, because I believe that it is time that we ought to care for each other more and sue each other less; and fifth and finally, within every community, linking people to ways that they can help. Everything I have done as President has tried to support this strategy. And that is why we have worked together to create the Points of Light Foundation, the Commission on National and Community Service, and then the National Center for Community Risk Management and Insurance. We envision national service not as a Government program, not even as a White House initiative but as a grassroots movement, a movement that makes full use of the many different ways that Americans want to help. This strategy is significant not because it indicates Washington's role but because it illuminates yours. And this is something where it is easy to miss the constellation for the stars. You see, it is not just Points of Light that are important. It is the idea that every community in America could be filled with light. America could become like this room. You are only a fraction of the stories that we have told. And those stories are only a fraction of those that could be told. You know, look around this room and then picture what would happen throughout America if every former gang member discovered the Rodney Dailey within and offered young people good alternatives to life on the streets. Imagine if every member, every member of a club, like the Rotary Readers, filled someone's life with the wonder of reading. Or what if every little girl found the imagination to follow Isis Johnson to clothe the cold and feed the hungry in her little corner of America. Imagine what America would look like. Regardless of what we believe Government should do, all of us agree that no serious social problem in this country is going to be solved without the active engagement of millions of citizens in tens of thousands of institutions, schools and businesses, churches and clubs, armies of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Government has a critical role in helping people and so does solid, sustainable economic growth. But people, people, not programs, solve problems. And somewhere in America, every serious social problem is being solved through voluntary service, for therein lies the greatest national resource of all. It does not matter who you are. Everybody's got something to give: a job skill, a free hour, a pair of strong arms. And that is what I mean when I say that from now on, any definition of a successful life must include serving others. Let me tell you another story about success. Today, I have recognized the 1,014th Daily Point of Light, the Lakeland Middle School eighth grade volunteers. These remarkable young people from Baltimore have overcome their own challenges to become tutors and role models for younger students in special education. Their special courage reminds me of the words of a poet who said, The generosity is not in giving me that which I need more than you do, but in giving me that which you need more than I do. That courage has made the Lakeland eighth graders into the wonderful and confident young people who grace our lives today. Because I know that America is filled with young people who want to help, I signed an Executive order last October that created the President's Youth Service Award. And as with the President's Physical Fitness Award, young people in voluntary service will be able to receive Presidential recognition in their local communities. I want to thank the boards of the commission, the foundation, and the American Institute for Public Service for their help in implementing this program. What all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure. And it is through service that all of us can find both. Barbara and I will soon be making our way back to Texas, and I'd like to leave you with one thought: If I could leave but one legacy to this country, it would not be found in policy papers or even in treaties signed or even wars won; it would be return to the moral compass that must guide America through the next century, the changeless values that can and must guide change. And I am talking about a respect for the goodness that made this country great, a rekindling of that light lit from within to reveal America as it truly is, a country with strong families, a country of millions of Points of Light. I want to thank the Points of Light in this room and everywhere across this country, those that we have recognized and the millions more that have found no recognition but are doing the Lord's work. Thank you and God bless you all. And God bless the U.S.A.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkscelebrationthepointslight", "title": "Remarks at a Celebration of the Points of Light", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-celebration-the-points-light", "publication_date": "14-01-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 935, "text": "Thank you very much, thank you. And thank you to Charlie for that introduction, which was so beautiful and for your fearless leadership of Turning Point Action and Turning Point USA. Thank you, Charlie, very much. Let me also express my incredible appreciation to the thousands of bold, young, and proud American patriots that are with us today. What a crowd. What a crowd. And you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It is about 110 degrees or something. That is an incredible group. Thank you. Thank you to the people outside. We love you. You are the pulse of our movement, so true, and you are the ones who will make America great again. I started saying make America great again, again, think of that. Think about that because nobody's done what we did in four years, the greatest economy, we will be talking about it. We have plenty of time. Does everybody have some time? I said, I look forward to this speech. They said, Oh good. I said, How long a flight is it? About five and a half hours? So I said, Oh, can we maybe do it by Zoom? But Zoom will never replace the real thing. Do we agree? Especially for our great young students, it cannot replace being in the classroom, can it? With your help, we will stand up for democracy and for justice. We will fight for truth, transparency and accountability, and we will not stop until we have restored our American birthright of honest, free, and fair elections. We are gathered here in Phoenix to show our support for election integrity and for the brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate. Thank you. You created a movement all over the country. This is now starting all over the country. I am hearing Texas wants to do a forensic audit, I just heard. Even though I won Texas by a lot, I said, You should do it because you will find out what is going on in this country. It is crazy. When you hear defund the police, when you hear no IDs Of course, now they are trying to get into the, We never really said that. It is crazy. But when you hear open borders, how about open borders? All this stuff. In my opinion, there is no way they win elections without cheating. There is no way. There is no way. No second amendment. They are against energy. We were energy independent two months ago, energy independent. Now we are not energy independent. I saw where they are negotiating now with OPEC again. Here we go again to negotiate. They are negotiating right now with OPEC and with Russia. We had so much oil. We did not know what the hell to do with it. It is not even believable. They closed up so many sites. Today I want to send our profound and everlasting gratitude to every Arizona Republican who had the fortitude and the backbone to defy the lying media. Look at that. That is a lot of media. A lot of media. See the red lights are starting to go off now. They are going, Cut. Cut. He is at it again. He is talking about the media. It is easy. Hey look. Some of them are down almost 80%. Can you believe it? And that is because they lose credibility, but I want to just finish it. We want to demand a full forensic audit of the results of Maricopa county. I particularly want to thank Arizona Senate president, Karen Fan. She is been great, she is been strong. And I predict when the votes come in and that is her in the Senate, I think they are going to be so horrible that she is going to go three steps further than she ever thought she'd have to because they will be in my opinion, and again, I am not involved. They are involved. This is the Arizona state Senate. I think the results will be so outrageous. You have already seen some of them come that they are going to go many steps further than they would have. Judiciary committee chairman Warren Peterson. Where is Warren? Thank you, Warren. Thank you, Warren. He is here someplace. Thank you, Warren. We did win. We really did. Not me. We all won. We won. Everybody. When you looked at election night, we were up by so much. It was over at 10 o'clock and then all of a sudden they close the tabulation areas. They closed everything and we wake up and all of a sudden it is tied or we are losing. And nobody believes that. They do not believe it. I tell you right now, they do not believe it. State senators, JD Mesnard, Kelly Townsend. Kelly, you have been so incredible. Kelly, JD, thank you. Where is Kelly? Kelly, thank you. Great job. Tremendous courage, you have. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it really a lot. Nancy Bartow. Nancy, wherever you may be. Nancy, thank you. Thank you very much. Great job. Thanks, Nancy. Nice to meet you. See, they all think I am involved. I am not involved. These are people that did this by themselves. They wanted to do it. They had to do it. They saw what was going on and they did it. So I am meeting some of you for the first time. Senator Kerr, where Senator Kerr? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Somebody who is been a warrior again. I do not know him. Sonny Borelli, he is great. Where is Sonny? There he is. I recognize that man from television, but I do not know Sonny. But Sonny, you are really an amazing guy and a brave guy and a strong smart guy. Thank you very much. All of you. Vince leech. Where is Vince? Thank you, Vince. Thank you. Thank you very much, Vince. Great job. Somebody else who is really been out there that is been a brave who wants to go many steps further than anybody, Wendy Rogers. Thank you, Wendy. Great job. You knew the answer early on when they were waiting for results, but you knew the answer. And I think Kelly Townsend is around someplace, where is Kelly? Good. Okay. I did not see you in the audience now. I want it. Okay. And by the way, Kelly has to get a special Really great. Wendy, Kelly, Borrelli, what a group. I would not want to fight. I would not want to fight you. Thank you. I like that. Wendy. We just have a new one, Wendy, Kelly, and Borelli that is going to be a very famous That is going to be a very famous someday, I suspect. Good. Great to meet you. Great. Republican party chairwoman, somebody that has tremendous courage I will tell you. Somebody that is been fighting so long and so hard and she never stops. And some people love her. And some people do not like her as much. I happen to love her, but she is. She is really a fighter. And she fights your governor who does not do a damn thing. She is fighting. He does not do a damn thing. Chairwoman Kelly Ward. Kelly? I called up Kelly recently. I said, Why would not the governor want an audit? Maybe everything will prove to be correct, which we know will not happen. I said, Why would not this governor Doug Ducey When I did rallies, he always wanted to be in the front row. Sir, could you mention my name please? I will mention. And I did these rallies and he was not very popular, but he won by a lot because he ran against a very defective candidate, which they found out after they nominated that Democrat. But I'd introduce him and I would not get much of an applause and I'd get a lot of boos. And I kept saying, This guy's not very popular. But now you know what? He is not popular with me either. They came to see me. They said, Sir, would you like him to run for the Senate? I said, He is not getting my endorsement. I can tell you. The Mitch McConnell, there is another beauty. The Mitch McConnell Republican. The Mitch McConnell. The old Crow. He was losing his election in the I will tell you, Kentucky is a great place. I love Kentucky. They love me and I love them and I was way up and he was losing by two points. And he said, Sir, I'd like to see you. He comes over. Would you give me a big endorsement? And could you do a television commercial? And I did not love the idea because I am not too high on him, but it was between him or a woman named Amy McGrath, a Democrat. She had 93 million sitting in the bank and he was two down and he was going to get blown away and I endorsed him and he went up 20 points, 20. She did not even spend her money. She had no chance because of my endorsement he went up 20 points and then he got up and said the nastiest things about me. That is the way politics is, I guess. Sonny, it is not that way in Arizona is it? Oh yeah. I think it is, Kelly. I think it is. No, it is not as bad. That was amazing. You endorse somebody, you help somebody. I do not want any praise. I do not want anything, but I do not want to have that kind of a thing happen. So it is one of those things. But what you are doing here is incredible as everyone here fully understands. The 2020 election was a total disgrace. It was the most corrupt. And I tell this to people. I tell it to Republicans and a lot of them are very good people and they say, Well, sir, we have to get onto the future. Let me tell you, you are not going to have a future. First of all, our nation is being destroyed, but you are not going to have a future in '22 or '24 if you do not find out how they cheated with hundreds of thousands and even millions of votes, because you will not win anything. You will not win anything. And I tell Republicans, I say, You do not realize, because some of them they are good meaning, really a lot of them, most of them. We have certain people that are not good. They do not have the Mitt Romney's the little Ben Sasse's of the world. They do not have I could name a few of them. Little Ben Sasse. Could I have your endorsement? Yes. The day after he won, he goes and starts going after ENTITY. But you know what? That is the way it is. But you know, I tell people, this is the biggest issue there is. This is bigger than the border. This is bigger than anything. This is the biggest issue. And I see it just here and I'd say I'd make a speech. And I talk about the border because we straightened out the border. We had the strongest border in history. We straightened out the border and that is a big deal. But when you look at all of the death and destruction that this election has caused and wait til you see what is happening with inflation. Wait til you see the real numbers on inflation and what is going on. And wait til you go to the pump today and you see $3.75 cents. We were at a $1.87 for a gallon of gasoline. It was the most corrupt, dishonest, and unfair election in the history of our country. The Democrats know it. The corrupt media, right back there a lot of people, they know it. Big tech knows it. And most importantly, we, the American people know it. We know it. But because of the steadfast conservatives all across our nation and that is really happening now. If you look at what is going on all across. They have come from so many different states to look at your audit procedures that they go back and I will call them and say, How did you like it? What did you think? They said, We do not believe it. And then they are starting their own audits now. That is what is happening. They are coming and looking. They are looking at what Karen and Kelly They are looking what they all set up here and they cannot Wendy, what you have done. Borelli, I love you. Borelli, you are Italian. I hope you are all Italian, Borelli? That is why I get along. That is why I like him. Good. He is tough as nails too, but you know what? They are coming in. They are looking and they go back to their state and they say, This is the most incredible thing that we have seen anytime. Why would not somebody want election integrity? Why would not they want to know? And I would be very happy. It will not happen, but I would be very happy if they did it and everything was perfect. But you are not going to find that. In fact, the preliminary numbers are a total disaster and we are going to go over those numbers. The facts are coming out. The truth is being uncovered and the crime of the century is being fully exposed. Thank you. With what inflation is doing to our country. The crime has never been higher than it is. Now you have in Chicago, hundreds of people are being shot every weekend in Afghanistan. We have not lost one soldier in Afghanistan for the last year and a half. In Chicago, they have 188 people shot over a weekend. Many of whom die. That is worse than any war zone anywhere in the world. Chicago and New York, what is happening in New York. The crime in New York. And Rudy Giuliani was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City, by the way. And they are going after him because he understands it and they are going after him. And he is a true patriot. What they are doing to Rudy is a disgrace. Greatest mayor and the greatest prosecutor. I mean, he was a crime fighter. He was a crime fighter, but this was the greatest mayor. And you know, if I would have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, it would not have meant as much. Now you realize what having a great mayor is all about because when you look at what the hell is happening to our cities, run by Democrats, all run by Democrats. There is never been any It is a crime wave the likes of which we have never seen before. It is scary. People are afraid to walk down to the streets of New York and nobody gets prosecuted except Republicans, by the way. In every fake news story about the election, they always begin by stating that claims are unproven. There is the fake news. Those claims are unproven. Do you ever notice, you read a story and you are reading about massive fraud, but they do not write about that too much. The biggest thing is they do not write But they always say, While this is totally unproven. And you are saying, Well, wait a minute, we caught thousands and hundreds of thousands of people. And then they go, While there is no evidence, they have these little soundbites. But the craziest of them all is and always done in unison because you know, they work together. If this were a business they would be put in jail because it would be called a monopoly. But the biggest and the craziest of the big lie, they call it. You know, what is the big lie? The opposite is the big lie. The election was the big lie. And I have got to tell you, I have got to say this. I have never said it before, but I have always thought it. If I lost the election, I am okay with that. I am okay with it. Seriously. If we lost the election, we lose an election. I will go home. I will start building buildings. I will do something. I will keep myself busy. But you know what? If we lost the election, we know when we lose. In Georgia, they had an election. We did so well. And everyone knew we won by hundreds of thousands and they stole it from us. And what happened is we had two senators running a couple of months later and you know what happened to them? The Republicans said, We are not going out to vote because this is rigged. This election was rigged, and they know it. You know when you win and when you lose. If I lost this election, I could handle it pretty easily. When they steal it from you and rig it, that is not easy. And we have to fight. We have no choice. We have to fight. And it starts right here with the amazing patriots in Arizona. And you are proving the fake news media wrong. You are proving them wrong because the evidence is monumental, just like Russia, Russia, Russia. Remember people would come up to me during the campaign, the first campaign and they said, Sir, you know what I think about Russia? No why do you ask? Just curious. There was these rumors. Another one would come up a month later, Sir, do you have anything to do with Russia? No, I never even thought of it. But after I got asked that question four or five times, I said, What the hell is going on with the Russia? And it was a fake deal made up by Hillary Clinton with a fake dossier where they pay. They play a different game. But you know, ultimately we are much bigger than them. We have many more people because when you go over their policies, the fact is those policies are not a 50% of the vote. We have many, many more people. They are tough, they are mean, and they stick together. They do stick together. But their policies are so bad. They are so pathetic. If they ever had our policies, maybe there'd be no Republican party, I must be honest with you, because we have not until now. And it started with these incredible people, many of whom are sitting right here. The state senators from Arizona, it started with them. And now it is turning out to be a revolution in this country because people are saying, even some Democrats, they are saying no. Knowing what happened in the election is a good thing, not a bad thing. It is a good thing. And what are they trying to hide? Why would not they want it? Now they are trying to hide at That is why I do not understand guys like Ducey and your commissioners. These commissioners, they are so bad. But you know, you have the witch hunt. Remember the great witch hunt and the impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two. And it shows you how the Republicans can really stick together. We have great Republicans. You have Jim Jordan. I am going to get in trouble, but you have Jim Jordan and Devin. And by the way, you have three of them here tonight. These guys I am going to I hope you love them all because those three are fighters. But we will introduce them in a second. They have already probably spoken. I hope they have. That way they will not take up any of our time. But they are great. Here is just some of the shocking information the auditors in Arizona have already reported. So this is reported. This is not coming from ENTITY. This has been reported. More than 74,000. Now I lost by about 10,000. We did not lose. We won by a lot. But they say we lost. So we need more than 10. So here we go. And we have numerous categories, almost all of which are much more than we would need to win the election. And again, remember the word determinative. If I lost by 10 and we found out that there were only two dead people, okay. But there were not . There were thousands and thousands of dead people that voted in different states, thousands and thousands. Some even applied for an application to vote. Do you believe that? So not only did they vote, they applied for an application, but if had two dead people and we lost by 10,000, I do not consider that. I do not . I only talk when it is much more than you need. So think of this. 74,000 mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent. Other than that, it was very good. There is no record of them being sent, but they were counted. So nobody knows where the hell are they, but we counter. The county has refused to disclose how many of these 74,000 were in person, early votes. And how many were magically appearing in a mail-in ballot box near you? How about those boxes? How about those boxes? How about those boxes where they were coming in and Biden was getting 97% of the vote? No, I do not think so. In all fairness, we'd come. We came for rallies here. We had 42,000 and 44,000 and he came and he could not fill the eight circles. They had to use the fake news. No, they were calling the news. Please, would you please stand over here please? They are getting newspaper reporters and reporters to stand there. They are standing with cameras. They could not fill the eight circles. The only thing I liked about his campaign, because he did not really campaign, the cabal campaign. Lots of people campaigned for him. But I did like the- pay for. But I did like the, the contractor, and it was not Hunter Biden with his artistry. Think of that. No, the contractor, those circles were so beautiful the way they were done. I am very good at building buildings and painting and all these different things. So painting, I know what a good paint job is, and you are not getting it from Hunter. But no, no, it was so professionally done. It was incredible. So good. In fact, I probably will not do it yet, but at some point I am going to find out the name of the contractor that did those circles, because I want to use them for some. But what about Hunter Biden getting a half a million dollars per painting, and he never painted before? Could you imagine if my kids did that? Could you imagine? And now they are justifying it. Well, we want to make it non-transparent. No, actually you should make it transparent, I guess. But actually you should not make it real because it is a bribe. It is a bribe, a hundred percent bribe. You have good painters. For $250, you can have a portrait done on Central Park. Guys with pencils. They do so incredible. They are geniuses. They are just geniuses. You go to Central Park, and they have all these artists lined up. You negotiate a deal, they will do it for $250. They are unbelievably talent. Some of them are beyond belief, what they can do in a short period of time. Hunter Biden's getting $500, 000. It is a bribe. It is disgraceful, and the fake news media is talking about it like it is okay, but we should have transparency. It is unbelievable. And the laptop and the laptop, I miss you too. And the laptop from hell, it is a laptop from hell. When you look at that laptop, people are writing about it. Meaning a very tiny group of people are writing. Some books are coming out. Some books by some very good people. But you know what? When you look at the laptop from hell, and then you watch the interview. It was Russia that did his laptop. Then they say, Was it Russia? Well, it may have been me. It may have been them. I think that is the end of that one. It is always Russia. You ever notice? It is never China. Because they are all getting rich from China. They are not getting rich from Russia. It is always Russia, Russia, Russia did it. Russia. Russia did it again. No, it is a disgrace. By the way, I stopped their pipeline. It was stopped. They have a pipeline going into Germany, going into Europe. I stopped it. I put sanctions on all these states and all of these companies who were building it. Biden approved it. Then as you know, you have heard this before he stopped the Keystone XL pipeline. The real number is 48, not eight. They said 8,000, 48,000 jobs. And they lost all over the country. People sold their home. They were so excited that we are going to be building this pipeline. Environmentally much better than a truck. Much better, frankly, than a train, a railroad, much safer. They were building it, and he stopped it like in the first week he stopped it. Yet he approves the biggest pipeline in the world, going from Russia to Germany. And we are supposed to protect Germany. I said that. I said, By the way, you would have never even heard about that pipeline if it was not for me. North Stream two, North Stream. Nobody ever heard of that. Nobody ever talked about it until I came along. Nobody did. Look, I get along with Putin because that is a good thing. I got along with him. He got along with me, but nobody was ever tougher on Russia that I was. This pipeline is the biggest thing they have ever done. This is billions and billions. I asked Angela, and I get along with Angela too, but she is doing what she is doing for Germany. Although I think the pipeline's a big mistake for Germany because they might as well just wave the red flag or the white flag because it is over. It is over. They are going to get 60, 70% of their energy from Russia. So I said, So let me ask you, so we are spending billions of dollars to protect you from Russia. And you are paying billions and billions of dollars for energy to Russia. What the hell is that all about? Right? So I stopped it and within a couple of weeks he approved it, and now they are going to be restarting it. They will have it finished in a couple of months and they are going to make billions and billions of dollars, but the American pipeline is stopped. And I can only say that is called America first versus America last. Look, they are destroying our country. If the election were the way it were, and let us say they were doing a great job, number one, you probably would not be as enthusiastic. Let us say they were doing a great job. By the way, your Arizona border, which I put up the wall. It was great. It was the best it ever was. And now what is pouring into your state is not even to be believed. You know what? If instead of doing the harbor. They are saying it was the worst six months in the history of the presidency. I do not know that that is true, but I would say it is. If you look at what is happened to the economy. How about the vaccine? I came up with the vaccine. They said it would take three to five years, going to save the world. I recommend you take it. But I also believe in your freedoms a hundred percent. But just so you understand, but it was a great achievement. But then, and we started. We are doing a million people a day, and then they said, We are going to put a pause on one of the vaccines. What that did, that set it back so badly. And so now they are saying what a wonderful job he did. They do not say it too much anymore with respect to giving the vaccine. Now it is turning out that they cannot say that anymore. And what they have done is because they do not trust the president, people are not doing it. And that is as simple as it can be. We did such an incredible job with COVID, with getting the gowns, the supplies, the ventilators, the masks, everything, and the press did nothing but kill us. They would say, Look how well India's doing compared to the United States. How is India doing? How is India doing? India is going through hell. They said, Look how well South Korea is doing. They would always try and pick the best country anywhere in the world that had the least problem. Those countries now are being ravaged by this plague that was sent to us by China. And by the way, China has to pay us retribution. All right. There were nearly 4,000 people who voted with a registration date after the cutoff on October 15th. So you have a cutoff, a legal cutoff, but thousands of people voted, and that is illegal. Why did 4,000 people vote? Additionally, there were more than 11,000 individuals who were not on the voter rolls the day after the election. Think of that. They were not on the voter rolls the day after the election. ut who were on the list of voters that was published one month after the election. So they were not there for the election, but a month later they happened to find them, okay? This alone is more than the supposed margin that you needed. It is 10,457 votes. We beat it in every category. There were 18,000 people who voted in Arizona in 2020, who were then purged from the rolls immediately after the election. Why did not they purge them before, Sonny? Could I ask you that question? Sonny said they cheated. They cheated. They cheated. We are becoming like a third world nation, and it is happening. Then 168,000 ballots were found to be printed on unofficial, very thin, flimsy paper. In other words, sounds to me like they were short of ballots, and they just made them up because you have what is called quote Voter secure paper. It is very heavy. It is like the dollar bill. It is very complex stuff. But they did not have that. So they had 168,000 votes and that is required. It is required. You have to have it. And they found it on paper. And the reason they noticed it, I guess, number one, it was very light, but they saw that when you hit it with a certain pen, it went right through the paper. They say, What the kind of papers is this? that is 168,000 votes. And so that also would have been invalidated. They would not have allowed it to be on election day. They would not have allowed it. 168,000 votes. I wonder who they voted for. Tell me, I wonder who they voted for. Would you say it was a hundred percent for Biden or 97%? It was also revealed in a recent hearing that there are thousands and thousands of duplicated ballots that do not have a serial number, suggesting that votes may have been fraudulently duplicated and counted multiple times. Time after time after time. You saw it in Georgia, you saw those people go in. They said, There is a water main break. Everybody leave, everybody leave. Everybody got the hell out. They do not want to drown. They do not want a water main break. And a short while later, a woman, a political operative, we all know her name. We all know her name, and it should have been taken care of, which should have been taken care of. But a woman comes in, but it is now it is in court, and it is a big deal. She came in with a group. She did not go back to her machine. They went for the table. They lifted up the skirt of the table, and lo and behold, it was loaded up with ballots, but they were not ballots that were in boxes that ballots come. They were in other, whether it was suitcases. It was totally different. They took those, and they started putting them in. Sometimes three times, sometimes five times. And they stood there. And I tell you what, when people looked at that they got sick. People threw up looking at it, and law enforcement did very little, but now what is happening is I believe the courts are going to do a lot. It is a big deal going on. That was total criminal behavior. So you hear those hundreds of thousands of votes. We won the state of Arizona, and we won it decisively. And we won other of these states. Is not it amazing? Barack Hussein Obama. He beat Biden all over the country decisively. So did Hillary, except in five swing states where Biden wiped him out with the black population. So I think that he is not going to beat Obama, but only of these states. So he did poorly, except in these states, he had massive victories. We are really smart people. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let this happen. Yet this is only the beginning of the irregularities the Arizona audit is an uncovering. The authors and the auditors have collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers lowered signature matching standards from 20 points of comparison to 10, to five, and eventually down to zero. In other words, they abolished all signature matching entirely. In other words, you have a bad signature. So the machine was picking up a lot of bad signatures. They said, This is no good. Let us lower it. Let us lower it. They brought it down to zero. So you had no signature matching. Perhaps. This is why the county has refused to comply with an official subpoena sent out by your great senate to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they counted ballots and whether or not they had signatures at all. Because we think many of them had no signature at all because you cannot sign them all during the night. We think they did not , and you know what else they did not have? They did not have folds. In order to have a ballot counted, it has to be folded. But so many of these pages are laying flat without a crease, without a fold. Cyber security experts have also testified that the logs for the election management system software were wiped under highly suspicious circumstances. This is them saying it, not me. With more than 37,000 requests made to the server in a single day. Think of that. Erasing the data permanently for the entire period surrounding the election. Gee, I wonder why they erased the data surrounding the election? I wonder why. The county has, for whatever reason, also refused to produce the network routers. We want the routers, Sonny, Wendy, we got to get those routers, please. The routers. Come on, Kelly, we can get those routers. Those routers. You know what? We are so beyond the routers, there is so many fraudulent votes without the routers. But if you got those routers, what that will show, and they do not want to give up the routers. They do not want to give them. They are fighting like hell. Why are these commissioners fighting not to give the routers? How simple could it be? That will tell the truth. What are they trying to hide? Unbelievably, the auditors have testified that the master database for the election management system, sorry to tell you, has been deleted. I wonder why it was deleted. I wonder, Sonny, why was it deleted, please? Meaning the main database for all of the election related data in Maricopa in 2020 has been illegally erased. It is been erased. The county has also refused to provide the authority for the information. We want the information needed to access vote tabulation devices. To top it all off, they have refused to hand over the all-important chain of custody documentation for Maricopa County ballots. They do not want to give it. Why do not they want to give it? Why? I stand before you today to demand nothing less than full and complete cooperation from Maricopa County and from the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors who have fought your senate at every single turn. Incredibly. Why? Why? Why? Why are Republicans fighting it? All they have to do is hand it over, and they are either going to be right. They are not even saying they are right. They just do not want it. They do not even say they are right. I think they know a hell of a lot about what happened, but why do not they want to do that? The citizens of Arizona, an incredible state that as you know, I won four years ago and I won it again. Somebody came in from a media group, a very good media group, actually, said, What was the difference between 2016 and 2020? I said, Well, the difference was I actually did much better in 2020. It is true. We got 75 million votes. We got 12 million votes more. No president in history has ever gotten anywhere close to 12 million more votes. And that is with them doing counting. So you can imagine what the real number is. Okay? Now you can imagine. Because the easiest way of cheating is to throw them away. That is easier. The postmen do not have to deliver them. The post office does not have to deliver them. It is a very Democrat group and why not? They have the greatest pension plan that anybody's ever seen. Why not? And that is okay. But you know, a lot of them did not go to their location and when they were signed, they did not get brought back. But when you think about it, and when you think about the corruptness, why do not these people want to find out the truth? The citizens of America deserve answers. We are talking about America. You know, we are not talking about Arizona anymore. We are talking about the United States of America because this has gone on. And I hate to say it, but this is because you are really bad, but this has gone much worse in Detroit, Michigan, much worse. We have a bunch of RINO senators up there. The exact opposite. You have one or two. We have a whole bunch of them up there, but we have a bunch of RINO senators. This is not as bad anywhere near, in my opinion, as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. You take a look at Philadelphia. What they did to our poll watchers were incredible. We had poll watchers, nice people, great people. They love our country. They were Republican, but more than anything else, they want an honest count. They'd turn them in either way. They were physically thrown the hell out and they could not get in for days. So during that period of time, vast numbers of things happen that are terrible. And not only did they throw them out, they boarded up the windows. So they could not even see inside. Then we got a court order, and they would not obey the court order. And then they kept them 60 feet away. Do you know what 60 feet? That is like me looking at a vote with the lady in the beautiful red dress right over there, right? That is 60 feet. And I am saying, Oh gee, how is that ballot? I am 60 feet away. They were threatened by thugs. In Georgia a a recent review of valid images has shown that the error rate in the hand audit of Atlanta's Fulton County was a whopping 60%. Would you say that is high? Including outright fabricated vote totals as well as obvious duplications of ballots amounting to potentially thousands and thousands of extra votes for Joe Biden. All of this is in addition to the recently discovered 35,000 illegal votes that were potentially cast by people who did not live in the county in which they voted. Minor detail. As well as 100,000 people who were purged from the Georgia rolls after the election. Think of this. I lost by like 11,000. 11,000. They have a 100,00 plus, they were purged. They were deleted after the election was over. Far exceeding the margin needed for a Republican presidential victory. That is just that one item. That is the only one, but we have many. In other words, it is determinative. It is no wonder that Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are going absolutely crazy screaming about voting rights, ranting about democracy. They want democracy and resisting every effort to look into the massive fraud in 2020. Just so you understand, we talk about cancel culture. The biggest thing that they want canceled is they do not want you talking about the election that just took place because they say, Holy shit, they caught us. They caught us. They caught us. We have seen it. It is a scandal, the likes of which we have never had, but the only way you get away with a scandal is if they do not talk about it. They do not want to talk about it. But they are going to have to. If your votes are like people are thinking they are going to be, and when you get up and announce whatever it may be, it is not going to be able. They are not going to be able not to talk about it. The press is so dishonest. They do not want to talk about it. But if you think about cancel. Everything about cancel culture, they want cancel culture. But what they do not want to do is anything having to do with the 2020 election. They almost got away with it. They may have gotten away with it. We are going to find out because something's going to have to be done. But I do not think so. I do not think so. If somebody robs Tiffany, a beautiful jeweler, 57th and Fifth, good location, excellent location. And they steal the diamonds and then they get caught. They have to turn the diamonds back. It is very simple. Amazing the way it works. I only wish that my friend Mike Pence had that additional courage to send the results back to the legislatures because it all happened so quickly. They schemed in this plan for four years, this all happened so quickly. If he would have sent it back to the legislature, somebody gave him bad advice. The great Thomas Jefferson, you know what happened? Georgia, they could not count their votes accurately. Hear ye, hear ye, the great state of Georgia can not accurately count its votes. You know what Thomas Jefferson said? Long time ago, he said, Then we will keep the votes from the great state of Georgia. He did not say, we are going to send it back. I am saying, just send it back. Maybe it comes back. But when you have more votes in some places by a lot than you have voters, I think Mike would have had the right to say, Excuse me, we have more votes than we have voters. If you do not mind, please take a look at it. Just a couple of the basics. Just a little basics. So I wish he did that. I wish he did that. The radical left Democrat communist party rigged and sold the election. And we caught them. The time to hold them responsible and fix this broken and corrupt system is not in 2022 where it may be just as corrupt. And if it is, you are not going to win. Or in 2024, the time is right now here in Arizona. Right now, right now. And you know what? If you do not get down to it and if you do not find, I hate to say this because it is terrible for our country. But you are going to have Republicans that are not going to want to vote. They are not going to want to work for Kelly. They are not going to want to have to work for Wendy and for Borelli, Mister Italy, they are not going to work for you. You know what they are going to say? They are going to say, We are not going to let it happen again. And that is what happened to the two senators. They are not going to work for you. And you got to get going. It is the most important issue. You got to get going. We do not have the luxury to sit back and to wait until the next election. We do not . So many people, and they are such good, I said it before. Sir, think to the future. You are leading in the polls. We just got back from CPAC. I was at 98% approval rating in the poll. 98%. Sonny, what am I here? I do not know. You think we are at 98? I want to find out. I do not know, 98, 98. And they say, Sir, you are leading in the polls, sir. You are way ahead of everybody. Run in '24, sir, you are going to win. And I say, Wait a minute, I just won six months ago. The survival of our nation depends on holding these responsible. And we have to hold these responsible elections. We have to hold those that are responsible for the 2020 presidential elections scam. It was a scam, greatest crime in history, and we have to hold these people accountable. And hopefully, and I say this, and I have confidence in it. Hopefully your Attorney General Mark Brnovich, your state attorney general will take information. This incredible information given by these incredible warriors and patriots. He is going to take it, and he is going to do what everybody knows has to be done. If he does not do that, it would be so sad. And your governor, Doug Ducey, he will be of no help to you. No help to you. It is incredible. He does not want to know the answer. But more is being found out and uncovered every single day. Not only in Arizona, but all over the country. Numbers like you would not believe. Just this month, the former US Attorney for Philadelphia, William McShade. Look, did you ever hear of him? William McSwain, who previously prosecuted much ballot stuffing, many cases in Philadelphia, published a stunning letter. And he did it, I think from the heart, stating that his office received allegations of large scale voter fraud. This is Philadelphia and election irregularities all over Philadelphia. Also one of the most corrupt places from a voter standpoint, another, along with Detroit and some others, one of the most corrupt places, but he found, and he wanted to investigate all of this. But the Attorney General Bill Barr ordered him to stand down, and McSwain was not the only one. And McSwain is very angry about it. Then Bill Barr went out and said there was not fraud in the election of any consequence. Look at the numbers. I am giving you today. Look at the numbers. And we need two large ones or three small ones. We have many, many to look at. But two large ones. In other words, we are right there. So it is of consequence. It is only because sadly, he just did not look for fraud. When that letter came out from McSwain, that was a sad day for this country, sad day. I was wondering because he was all excited. McSwain was all excited. He was going to go in there. Then one day it is like somebody died. he was told not to do it. One day, I noticed that the fake news media was calling Bill Barr, a puppet of ENTITY. And he was not a puppet at all. They had a picture of him with strings where I was totally controlling him. Just not true. They were saying that Bill Barr, you have to go against him, Bill Barr. Then they started saying they were going to impeach him. And they are what is called playing the ref. You know what that is? They are doing it with the Supreme Court too. They are nasty. You see now again, they want to impeach Kavanaugh? Not that they want to impeach him. They want to scare the hell out of him so he votes along the liberal lines because if he votes along the liberal lines, they are playing the ref better than the great Bobby Knight of Indiana ever played the ref. Remember with the chair? The this they said, Bobby, Bobby, you are not going to win that call- Or this, they said, Bobby, Bobby, you are not going to win that call. He said, But I am going to win the next one. That is what they are doing. The great Bobby Knight, who was one of our great endorsements. I will tell you, when Bobby Knight endorsed ENTITY, Indiana, we were doing well there before, you had to see after. Bobby Knight, that is a piece of work, but he said, It may not work this time, but it is going to work the next time. And the refs were afraid to say anything. It is true. That is what they are doing with our Supreme Court. They are trying to scare Kavanaugh. They are talking about an impeachment. I just saw it again this morning in the paper. They want to impeach Kavanaugh again. It is not that they do. They want him to rule for them. And if he rules for them, they are never going to impeach him. But if he rules against them, like he supposed to, because he is a conservative, but they also do not want to have a packed court. So they are saying we are going to pack the courts. We are going to pack the courts. And they did the same thing to Barr. They said, ENTITY controls him. As soon as I saw that, I said, Here we go, because how does he get out of that? Very simply, just do things like the vote was not rigged. And he stopped them from doing it. And I am so saddened by it. But I also understand it because nobody does it better than these crooked Democrats. Nobody does it better. So I do not blame Barr. I do not blame a lot of people, but they become weak and they become ineffective and they become frightened. Like it or not, we are becoming a communist country. That is what is happening. That is what is happening. We are beyond socialism. When you have no press that you can talk to, that is how a communist country begins. They have no press. We find things in Arizona, and other than a couple of great networks, we have no press. We have no voice. I only have voice because I get great ratings. Ultimately ratings are very important. But even those lights, they still have those lights going. That is good. I am very impressed. That is good. Thank you. And if the Democrats get some of the things they currently want passed, including the election of Corrupt Politicians Act, an infrastructure, which is not infrastructure, it will get even worse. What they are asking for is incredible. The Green New Deal, going to destroy our country, this Green New Deal. It is green new bullshit. That is what it is. It is bullshit. No more windows in buildings because environment. I always did great with these buildings that the bigger the window, the better I did, the bigger those windows, I wanted floor to ceiling windows, but they say you cannot do that anymore. We do not want any more windows. It is going to be real hard to sell apartments, I think. We have a beautiful apartment, and for environmental reasons, we have not put windows in the building. Oh great. Well, that sounds good. These people are crazy. Whatever happened to cows, remember they were going to get rid of all the cows? They stopped that, people did not like that. Remember? You know why they were going to get rid of all the cows? People will be next. People will be in there. Sadly, even in many red states, the rhinos are letting the radical left have their way on everything. In fact, I have to say this, in many cases, these weak Republicans or rhinos, these weak Republicans are worse. They are worse than Democrats. And you have a couple of examples right here in Arizona and do not nod. And do not say it because I do not want to get you in trouble. Maybe you can convince them to do what is right. But you have a couple of them right here in Arizona and nobody knows. And I will tell you what, they are going to be defeated as sure as you are sitting there, they are going to be defeated in the primaries by real Republicans. And it is not so far off. You have secretaries of state certified election results that were highly inaccurate. And even fraudulent they are certifying elections where the numbers are fraudulent. You have poll watches, as I said, who were illegally blocked from vote counting in Philadelphia, Detroit, and many, many other cities. In certain areas, there were more votes than there were voters. Think of that one. That was so easy. You say all these different things. A lot of people talking about the machines, I say, you know what? Too complex, you do not need them. It is so many different forms. They cheated in so many different ways. You do not have to get complex. You do not have to be a great scientist from MIT. They cheated in so many different ways. People were caught on camera illegally running ballots multiple times through voting counting machines. And remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I am the one trying to save American democracy. I am trying to save it. Our country is being destroyed by people who have no right to destroy it. People that won an election illegally. People that should not have been elected. They lost in a landslide. Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are wrecking our nation. I do not even believe it is him. I honestly do not believe. I do not think Joe knows where the hell he is. I do not think it is him. Crime is surging. Inflation is soaring. The border is gone. We went from the strongest border ever to the weakest border ever. The border is non-existent. Illegal aliens are pouring in, in record numbers. Critical race theory is being forced into every facet of our society. Free speech is being crushed. Men are being allowed to compete in women's sports. How do you like that? Think of that. How fair is it? Did you see the weightlifter? I hate to tell you this women, but he shattered your longstanding record. This guy gets up boom, boom, like a nine year record, sonny, a nine year record. Boom. Did he do it with one hand? It is so unfair. It is so unfair. So ridiculous. I will be honest though, look, we all like to win. If I were a coach, I will tell ya. I would not be talking to too many women as we know women. I'd be getting some of these people that they are women. Somebody said that if LeBron James ever decided to get the operation, how would he be? How would he be on the court? And by the way, LeBron James, you can have him. Did you see the basketball ratings, which were terrible. But they went up after his team was defeated and that is happening. It is in sports and people do not want to see it. They want to see athletes. They want to see competition. But the last thing they want to see is men competing in women's sports. Because very soon, you are not going to have women competing anymore. I hate to say it. I hate to say, you are going to have a coach have a full team. And that team is going to win the national championship so easily, you are not going to have women competing. They are taking away your rights. That is really a women's rights movement. You cannot let that happen. And now they just allowed it to happen in the Olympics. The Olympics has gone bad too. Our infrastructure is being hacked by foreign countries left and right. Thousands of rockets are being fired at Israel. And Joe Biden is allowing America to be pushed around and laughed at all over the world. This did not happen when I was president. This did not happen when I was president. In addition to all of our work, to hold Democrats accountable for their election fraud, which is massive, we must fight harder than ever before to win a colossal victory for America first Republicans, next year we have to, but again, you have to solve this problem. We are going to work our asses off. But you have to solve this problem. Have to solve this problem. We must reclaim the House. We must reclaim the Senate. State legislatures all over. We did so well last election. And governor's mansions all across the nation. Last year, Republicans made massive gains. I got no credit from these people. None. I made 58 phone calls, 58. They are called teleconference calls. Everybody I made it to did so great. I was responsible for getting these people elected. In the House, we were expected to lose 25 to 35 seats. And instead of losing 25 to 35 seats, we lost for the first time in many decades, zero seats. And in fact, we shockingly gained 16 seats. And in the Senate, without my involvement, it would right now be 60/40 with the Democrats in the lead. Nobody likes to talk about that. We had such an incredible evening in the election. We did so well in the election. They like to say, I will tell you, you had a gentleman here, a legislator here who said Thank you. And I love you too. He said, Sir, I was prepared to lose my election, people that you know. I did not know him. I spoke to him for the first time. He said, I was prepared to lose my election. Two months before, I was prepared. Then I went to one of your rallies. And I saw the level of enthusiasm with thousands of people unable to get in. 42,000 people, thousands unable to get in. I saw the enthusiasm, but I was very much prepared. I assumed I was going to lose. He has been there for a long time. Then he said, And then the night before the election, I walked outside with my wife. And there were all these ENTITY signs, ENTITY, ENTITY, all over the place. Elect ENTITY, ENTITY Pence. They had ENTITY Pence and ENTITY, but they had all of these signs and they had the American flag and everybody was going wild. I said 'Darling, I think I am going to win the election.' And the next day, sir, I won the election and I won my district by a lot. And you lost my district. And there was no way that I got more votes than you. You got far more votes than I did, sir. There is no way possible. And I said to my wife, 'This election is rigged.' And what the fake news goes around saying is the reason we did so well in legislatures, the reason we did so well in Congress with not any loss, but all of these gains, I guess it was 16. All of these gains and the Senate, we did very well. Even though Mitch McConnell should not have said, We will not give 25 cents more than $600. And the other side said, We will give you 2000. Like it or not, that is not good politics. And frankly, they were going to get it anyway. It was a disastrous thing. He did ads where he was in the ad and he is not a popular guy. So we should have won those seats. But if you just forget those two seats, we would have been 60/40. And what they try and do is say, Well, the reason we won all Did not we win every legislature in the country? The reason we won is because the legislators were far more popular than ENTITY. No, it is not that, that is why I tell you that rather long story, because we carried them in, but they did not give me and the presidency, they did not give us the votes. That is all it is. It is very simple. And they are liars and they are scoundrels. And they are very bad and very dishonest, but that is just the way it is. Right here in Arizona, we must fire one of the most extreme leftists in Congress, your radical Democrat Senator Mark Kelly. And it is not that he is leftist. It is that he does not care about the border. With all the time I spent winning the legal stuff, I think we had 11 lawsuits, we won them all, and then I could start. It would have been so much easier, but I never heard from him. He never said, How can I help? He could not care less about your border and your border in Arizona is one big We did such a great job, but he did absolutely nothing. Kelly has done nothing to protect your state. And if you look at the Biden border crisis and it is beyond a crisis, they are saying, Oh, do not use the word crisis. Well, now that is like a nice word. He is completely owned and controlled by Pelosi and Schumer. And the open border is left. Now, the socialist Democrats and communists are trying to include amnesty in their reconciliation bill, which would turbocharge the crisis and neither Mark Kelly, nor anybody on the democratic side They are all fake moderates. They are fake. They say they do not say a word about it. If this change is not made soon, Arizona will never be able to recover from what is happening. You are getting it worse than most because you are on the border. So big on the border. Taking back america begins with kicking Mark Kelly the hell out of the United States Senate. With us today are a few of the Republican candidates running to beat Mark Kelly next year. And maybe if you are around, stand up. Blake Masters, where is Blake? Blake, thank you. Thank you, Blake, good, you are doing well. Jim Lehman, Jim. Thank you, Jim. Great job. Thank you, Jim. General Mick McGuire. General, thank you very much. Thank you, General. Also with us, are Arizona's gubernatorial candidates, Matt Salmon. Hi Matt. Kari Lake. Whoa. Wow. This could be a big night for you. Thank you very much, Kari. Good job. Steve Gaynor. Steve. Thank you, Steve. And state treasurer Kimberly Yee. Thank you, Kimberley. I have to tell you, maybe the most pleasure I will get out of any introductions tonight because these guys are warriors. They are warriors. They love your state. They love this country. We are thrilled to be joined by several of our really best people in Congress. They happen to reside in a place called Arizona. First of all, Andy Biggs, where is Andy? Warrior. You are so lucky to have these three guys. There are no games with these three guys. Paul Gosar, Paul. Paul. Incredible. And a woman that I have fallen in love with and the first lady is very upset about it. She is incredible. What she did during the impeachment, especially the impeachment hoax number one, she made a name for herself. She did not do it for herself. She did it for this country. Debbie Lesko, Debbie. Great. Debbie. Those are three great people. I actually said, Do we have our stars? Yes, sir. They here. They would not miss it. But I appreciate it. You really are. You are warriors and you love this country. Thank you. When we win giant Republican victories and reclaim control over Congress and really reclaim it over our country, we will halt the radical Biden agenda in its tracks. By the way, remember, I used to say, it is going to be worse? It is not him. I really do not believe. But remember I used to say it was going to be worse? Bernie Sanders can not believe what is happening. He is the happiest guy, he said, I never knew this was going to happen. Is that right, Paul? He said, I never knew this was going to happen. He cannot believe it. This is so much more radical. They never talked about this. They never talked about closing up the pipeline the following day. He talked about, We are going to study it. We are going to look at it. No, he did that, got some votes and he closed it. And how about the union on the Keystone pipeline? How about the union where they endorsed Biden? And I said, You know you are going to get screwed, but they have always been with Democrats, but you know what? The voters are with me. The voters are with me and the workers. The workers are with me and with us, we will stop the federal takeover of elections and stop the Democrat attack on voter ID. Did you see the disinformation campaign? So they do a poll the other day and it showed voter ID, Andy, is it 88%, including Democrats, it is 88%. Everybody wants voter ID. Who does not want it? You go to the grocery store, you give a picture, do anything you do. You give a picture. Voter ID is at 88%. So here is their line, all of a sudden, we do not want a voter ID. Then one day they pass it on and the press plays along. We have always wanted voter ID. We have always wanted it. It is the Republicans who do not want it. Think of this. And they had the same thing with defund the police. We want to defund the police. We will defund the police. Now crime is at the highest it is ever been in history. These police departments have been devastated. They have treated our great law enforcement, I just met a lot of them backstage, so badly with so little respect, but it is a very unpopular thing. They did not know that. Who the hell would not know that? Defund the police. I am telling you, they have got advantages, but they are dumb in a lot of ways, their policy is so bad. So now they are saying, you guys see that, It was the Republicans that wanted to defund the police. It is just like Russia, Russia, Russia. They make up stuff. I watched that shifty shift go up to the microphone. It is extremely important to save our country. ENTITY is a paid employee of Russia. It is unbelievable. And you know what they say, if they say it over and over and over again, in a year from now, a lot of people are not going to remember who wanted to defend the police and who did it. And they are not going to remember about voter ID, Andy. And we got to be careful with that. Paul, we got to be careful with that. Debbie, you are not going to let that happen. You are not going to let it, but that is what they do. And you know what it is called? Disinformation. They make up a lot of crap and they say it over and over and over. And one day you say, Oh, who was the one that wanted to defund? I guess it was the Republicans. The Republicans are against a very serious and a very sick enemy. We will end Joe Biden's war on American energy and ensure that the United States remains the dominant energy superpower on earth. Can you imagine they are out negotiated with OPEC again? We did not need OPEC. That is why I was taking everybody out of the Middle East because we needed the Middle East for oil. Now we need the Middle East for oil again. We will break up the big tech monopolies. And we will immediately shut down Joe Biden's border disaster. And we are going to end, by the way, catch and release. I ended catch and release. You know what it is? You catch a criminal and you take his name or whoever, you take his name, her name, and you release them into our country. You release them. We did something slightly better. Stay in Mexico. We have stayed in Mexico. And we will restore our southern border. We want to remain, let them remain in Mexico. The people, they are all over the United States, your border, and you are getting hit hard, probably harder, much harder, but all over the country, you can go to Iowa. You can go to all over the country. They are being hit and it is a crime wave. Big crime wave is coming out of it. Go all over the country. And you will see you are being hit. Right here in Arizona, Joe Biden has utterly demolished your border and cynically betrayed the people of the state because he never said he was going to do that. I told you he would. In May alone, border patrol encountered 540% more illegal migrants in the Tucson sector and 1500% more in Yuma than the same period when I was Think of that, 1500% more in one year. Now that does not mean as much as this for everyone you catch,, I think 10 come in. Some people say it is five or six. Let us say it is 10. You are talking about millions of people are coming into our country. We expedited removals and deported criminal aliens by the thousands. We took out MS-13 gang members by the tens of thousands, we got them out. Thousands and thousands of these absolute killers. And we built nearly 500 miles of beautiful border wall. The same wall that they wanted. I went with them. I said, I do not want the anti-climb paddle on top. You know the paddle on top that you see? I said, I do not like it. I do not want it. They said, Sir, it is anti-climb. I said, Oh, in that case, I like it. And they got to paint the wall, by the way, it sounds not so nice at a speech. How can Churchill make a great speech and say you got to paint the wall? It is pretty basic. Remember what I used to say? There were two things that will never get obsolete. Everything's obsolete. You have a new computer, three days later, you read it is obsolete. Two things. What are the two things? The wheel and the wall. We achieved the most secure border in US history. Biden's open border policies have blown it all up in shreds so fast. And they have enriched the drug cartels, the child smugglers, the woman's smugglers, and the vicious MS-13 gang members. They are making more money with human trafficking now and drugs, the sale of drugs, we had fentanyl down to the lowest it is been in 15 years because it is not just people. It is the drugs that come across. We had it to the lowest. This drug is a killer. A small amount can kill a thousand people. A little amount can kill thousands of people. We had it to the lowest level it is been in 15 years and it was going down and now he blew the thing up. And I used to say, it is incompetence, but they must really want this to happen. Why would not they have finished the wall? It would have taken two months. What are they doing? What are they doing? This is not just a national security crisis. It is truly a humanitarian catastrophe. Last month alone, the remains of 43 people were tragically discovered along the Arizona border. Just your border. Nearly 100 migrant children were found stranded in the sweltering, Arizona desert, having been cruelly enticed to the United States by Biden's rhetoric. He said, Come in everybody, come in. And they heard that and they all started walking up and I said, You cannot come in. You will be stopped. And we have 28,000 Mexican soldiers that are there. I said to the president of Mexico, who I like a lot, and he actually likes me. He is from a different persuasion. He is a socialist, but he is a great gentleman. And I said, Mr. President, you are going to have to stop them because we are building the wall and they are coming in. And I worked out a deal. I said, I will not put tariffs on the thousands and thousands of cars you send over on a daily basis, but you have to put 28,000 soldiers on our border free of charge. And he said, I will do that. Now they are gone. And now they are all gone. And those soldiers knew what they were doing. I will be honest with you, there were no games. There were no games. We did a great job during the construction of the wall. Once the wall was up, you did not need them, but you have to finish the level empty areas of the wall. The flood of illegal immigrants is also placing a crushing burden on communities across the state and throughout the nation, depleting your already overcrowded schools and hospitals and public services of critical resources, you know that. They are so crowded now because there're so many people, many of them cannot speak English. The whole thing is a catastrophe. Your kids are saying, What the hell is going on? Even before the Biden border crisis, Arizona taxpayers were spending a staggering $2.3 billion a year to pay for the welfare education justice system, course and illegal immigration, $1,000 per Arizona household every year. And that is now going to be doubled and tripled. In our movement, we believe that your taxpayer dollars should go to support truly needing Americans. You have to take care of American citizens. And look, we all have a heart. I see the same thing as you do, and we want to help people. But when you say, Come up, come up, come to America, our country cannot afford it. Our system is breaking down. We cannot afford it. You just cannot afford it. The whole world. This is in Mexico and Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador. They are coming in from Yemen. They are coming in from all over the Middle East. They are coming in from Haiti. Large numbers are coming in from Haiti. They are coming in from all parts of Africa. numbers are coming in from Haiti. They are coming in from all parts of Africa. They are coming in from Europe, they are coming in from all over the world. And our country's not, no country is set for that. Number one, you cannot afford it. Number two, on a human basis and even on a common sense basis, it is going to destroy it. They are destroying our country. They are destroying our country. Under my Administration, America was respected again and respected like never before. We withdrew from the United Nations corrupt We withdrew from the United Nations corrupt Human Rights Council. So corrupt, which seemingly existed to criticize Israel and the United States. That is all they did was criticize us. But not only is Joe Biden, reentered the shameful and ridiculous international tribunal, but just this month you saw this, the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, sent them a pandering and very, very strange letter begging to United Nations to come and investigate America for its alleged systematic racism. So you have systemic racism. He says he wants it to be investigated. Systemic racism. I said, That did not happen. Did it? I thought there is nothing, it is a joke about it. But I said, That is not serious, right? Systemic racism, please come and investigate the United States. The Biden Administration's action is an outrageous insult to the American people and to our country. The United States of America is the most just and virtuous nation in the world in the history of the world. And I will tell you, you are not going to have a country very much longer. You are not going to have a country. Always I talk about, we can do this, we can do that. Three and a half years is a long time. Two years is all they need. They are going to knock out the filibuster, you watch. I used to tell Mitch McConnell, you know what? You better knock out the filibuster and get everything approved, because they are going to do it. They will never do that, sir. Why will not they do it? Because it is bad for America. Do you think they care about America? They do not care. And the first day they announced that they are going to knock the hell out of it, you watch. The two senators are going to do a folder, and you are going to have a big problem, especially in light of all of the disasters that Biden has caused. We should not be apologizing to the world. We are apologizing for America, just like Obama apologized. Remember, he apologized. They should be apologizing to America for what they have done to it. That is who I think should be apologizing to. The Biden Administrations, America last philosophy because it is America last. It is America last. That is all it is, is also making a mockery of our country right here at home. Earlier this year, Biden signed an executive order pushing toxic, Critical Race Theory into our children's schools and into our military. How about our military? This poisonous left wing doctrine is flagrant racism, plain and simple. And it has no place in our schools, no place in our military and no place in our country. You remember, I ended it very rapidly with a very powerful executive order, but that executive order was immediately repealed and terminated by the radical left. A Republican Congress will defund it and ban it once and for all. They are going to ban it. They will get it done. In testimony before Congress, lightweight Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, actually defended the teaching of CRT, a Marxist ideology, to our men and women in uniform. Can you believe it? These soldiers, they are the greatest. They are hearing this stuff, they are saying, I cannot believe what I am hearing. The soldiers are saying it. He said he wanted to quote, understand white rage. He wants to understand white rage. What the hell is he talking about that for? Our generals should not be focused on learning left wing ideology. They should be focused on defeating America's enemies and winning our future wars. Hopefully we do not have them, but if we do, we have to win them. And I say it, and I will say it, whatever. The only reason I appointed Mark Milley in the first place is because two of the world's most overrated generals, James Mattis and John Kelly could not stand him, had no respect for him and would not recommend him under any circumstances. They even tried to send him to Europe so he would not get the job. So when they did not like him, I said, Let us give this guy a shot. Last summer, when rioters were threatening to destroy Washington, DC, Milley practically begged me not to send in the military to stop the destruction. I was thinking about it. It is a big step to do it. Insurrection Act, big step to do it, but I was getting close, but he did not want to do it. He did not want to do that. Why would we ever want to do a thing like that? After walking, and I did plenty, I signed a executive order on statues. You knock down any of us statues, you go to jail for 10 years and it all stopped. It was a miracle. Right, Andy? It all stopped. Paul, that was great. We stopped it. When they were pulling down statues and then it got crazy. They start pulling down statues of Abraham Lincoln. It would have never stopped, but I signed that order. And as soon as I signed that order, not one event took place. You get 10 years for even attempting to take it down. All stopped, amazing. It is amazing. After walking with me to the smoldering church, they tried to burn the church down the day before, the smoke was still coming out of it. Milley issued a groveling apology because he caved to the press. He was afraid of the press. And it was really in order to take off the pressure again, is what they do to these people is they come after them through the media, through every way they can. And they end up being weak people. All he had to do was say that I am proud to walk with anyone representing the President of the United States, and people would have understood that. He apologized. And that was the end of him when he did that apology, that was the end of him, nothing to do with me. It is the office that counts. As the radicalization campaign in our military illustrates. We are seeing almost every major institution in American life be taken over and weaponized by the extreme left, including law enforcement, the military, the corporate media. These people here just, you know, it is just I hope they are , more than anybody in this room, I hope they are listening because they are destroying our country. And especially the big tech companies, which are engaged in illegal censorship of the American people. It is a first step to restoring free speech in our country. This month, as you probably read, I filed a major class action lawsuit suit against big tech . If you want to join, you can. We are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google in Federal Court. And we will keep on fighting until we have reclaimed the sacred right of freedom of speech for every single citizen of this nation. What they do to the conservative voice, and again, they say private, but they have Section 230, which basically gives them immunity, that gives them no problems at all. We do not need lawyers. So once they do that, they have a right that nobody, Section 230, that no other company has anywhere in this country, so that no longer puts them in that category. And we can go after them and let us see what happens. But far worse than even big tech is the lame stream media, which is no longer free. And with few exceptions is totally corrupt and is truly the enemy of the people. That is all that you can say. You know that. And maybe I see it better because we can give them a statement that is so accurate and so proven. And then they write it the opposite. Whereas if you are a carpenter, you are an electrician, you are a worker, you are a lawyer, whatever you might do, you do not know that. You just think that what you are reading, they have the lowest rating right now, approval rating, in history, in the history of the rating business. They have their lowest rating, because people have gotten wise to them. And I think it is something that in terms of legacy, I am very proud of what we have been able to do. I am very proud of it. Nobody had any idea the level of deception and corruptness. The media does not report the news anymore. They only report bad things about us and make it worse. They report bad things and they make it worse and good things about them and they make it much better. And they make it much better. If there is anything bad about the other side, they never want to talk about it. Look at Hunter Biden. They do not want to, you do not see it. They do not want to talk about it. Can you imagine if that were a Republican, if that were a conservative in some high level? As an example, the network nightly newscasts hardly ever discuss the crime rate, which is at an all time high. The disaster taking place at the border or Joe Biden's very slow vaccine rollout is very slow, very slow. They actually tried to take credit for the vaccine and that did not work out too well. They do not blame Biden for anything, including the fact that the virus is making an unexpected comeback and ravaging countries throughout the world. Only in a short time ago, it looked like it was going to be good, but nobody says it is Biden, does anybody say it is Biden's fault? And I am not even blaming him, but does anybody say it? Because the job we did was so incredible. That is why we are in the position we are in today. So incredible. And that is all they wanted to talk about. They wanted to demean and it was a disgrace. The radical left is determined to ruin everything in America. That is what they are doing. Woke politics takes the life and joy out of everything. Woke-ism makes you lose, ruins your mind and ruins you as a person. You become warped. You become demented. The US Women's Soccer team is a very good example of what is going on. Earlier this week, they unexpectedly lost to Sweden, three to nothing, and Americans were happy about it. You proved that point before I even said it. Now the left is in the process of destroying our national pastime, baseball. First, we saw the embarrassing spectacle of the Commissioner of baseball, bowing to the radical left on voter fraud. You saw what they did. You saw they moved the All-Star game. Now one of the most beloved and storied franchises in baseball, all of baseball, I watched it as a kid at Yankee Stadium. The Cleveland Indians will be changing their name, a name that was filled with history and memories. The new name will be the Cleveland Guardians, which is terrible. The Cleveland Indians, if I were an Indian I'd sue. Sue them, Indians. I mean, what could be better? Especially if you have a good team, the Cleveland Indians, it is one of the greatest names. One of the most incredible logos. People love it. They are going absolutely crazy in Ohio over the name change. The Cleveland Guardians, what is that all about? The insanity of the left knows no bounds. And both Indians and baseball fan should be greatly insulted. They want to take away our history, our heritage, our culture, and everything that holds us together. By the way, remember when Bill Clinton was in Arizona, do you remember that? It was about 125 degrees out, sorry to bring that up. And he has a bad heart. And he said he was playing golf, but actually he was meeting on an airplane with the Attorney General discussing Hillary. I wonder what they were discussing. Remember he said, No, no. I was only there, I was only there to discuss my grandchildren and golf. Remember that? He said he was out there to play golf, but it was about 121 degrees that day, which is a little hot. What is happening to our country has sadly happened to so many others. We are at the beginning of a communist system. Radicals are seizing power and destroying everything we hold dear as Americans and it is happening. And I said it was going to happen. They dismantle the rule of law, censor speech, take over the free press, imprison political opponents. You see that is happening all over. Look at what I have been through for years. And of course, hold fake, phony elections. It was recently revealed that during the hand recount in Fulton County, Joe Biden had batches of ballots go for him. 100 for Biden, nothing for ENTITY. I got nothing. I got nothing. Give me one vote. One vote. Even Fidel Castro only got 99%. Okay. So many of our state and local offices have been overtaken by corruption. The radical left install partisan Democrat prosecutors who are not interested in equal justice, but political justice. It is happening at a level that we have not seen this happen in many, many years. They would wield law enforcement against political opponents, inventing that never had been prosecuted before, while murderers and criminals walk free without prosecution at all, all over the streets of our cities in particular. They have turned our cities into Banana Republics where the innocent are persecuted while crime soars. Just look at what they have done in New York city. Innocent people are beaten in the streets daily. People are shot in Times Square. Rapes and murders are totally out of control. And yet what are the leftists and the attorney general and district attorney's offices working on so diligently? This is what they are working on so diligently and with such passion, it is get ENTITY. They campaign on getting ENTITY. Their campaign, we are going to get ENTITY. We are going to take down ENTITY. They do not talk about the murderers. They do not talk about no cash bail. They do not talk about all these dangerous people walking the streets so people are afraid to come to New York. They are still coming after me because I will never stop fighting and winning for you. Going through it for five years, five years. From the very beginning of our movement, we have been fighting against some of the most corrupt, powerful and entrenched forces imaginable. The professional political class, the deep state, the fake news media, the Russia hoaxers, the globalists, the socialists, the communists, the lobbyists, the corporate special interests who are absolutely terrible. And now the Critical Race Theorists, all of them oppose our movement for a simple reason. We believe in putting America first. It is very simple. We believe in strong families, strong borders and strong sovereign nations. We believe in fair trade for the American worker. Look at what we did with the worst trade deal in the history of the world, NAFTA. Now we have the USMCA, and Mexico and Canada are not thrilled. That is a good sign by the way, but it is a great deal for us. And the stiff tariffs that I put on communist China, I tell you what, all they wanted to do is not have me put on tariffs. We were getting along absolutely great until COVID came. The China virus came, we were getting along great. We are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China in tariffs and what was happening, our farmers with the trade deal that I made with China were doing phenomenal. They are doing now phenomenally because China is buying numbers that nobody's ever seen before, corn and soybeans, everything they are buying. But you know what? Once the virus came in, I did not even talk about that trade deal. It meant nothing to me. It meant nothing to me. So sad for what is happened to our country. So said what happened to the world. So many people are dead and so seriously injured, and they are going to have to pay. We believe in low taxes, low regulations, unleashing American energy independence, and putting, we have to have independence with our energy. Think of what they are doing. Think of what they are doing. Look at what is happening at the pump. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. It is going up at a record pace, and you are going to be at $7 or $8 or $9 a gallon, and putting American jobs before the interests of foreign corporations. We believe in ending the endless foreign wars, rebuilding our military, supporting our warriors, taking care of our great veterans and bringing our troops back home, where they belong. Where they belong. And as you know, I started the move out of Afghanistan. I think it was impossible for him to stop it, but it was a much different deal. I told the Taliban, I spoke to the leader and I spoke. I said, let us call him Muhammad. I said, Muhammad, we are leaving and we are going to get along. But just in case, for any reason you decide to do something terrible to our country or beyond what is normal, because they have been fighting for a thousand years, in your country, we are going to come back and we are going to hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And I told him that. This was a telephone conversation, had a number of them. I said, We are going to get along great, but I just have to make that statement. We are going to hit you harder than any country. And he is a rough guy. This guy has been fighting from the time he is two years old. That is what they do. They fight. That is what they do. They fight. Russia did very poorly against them. Russia is Russia now, not the Soviet Union because of Afghanistan. Afghanistan. So they fight. I said, We are going to come back and hit you harder. Do you understand? He goes, Huh? He is a rough guy. I started off the conversation. I said, Muhammad, how are you? ENTITY. Uh. Not a lot of social grace, but he was being nice. I think he was being as nice as he could be, Andy, but they are rough. That is all they do is fight. But I said, We are going to come back and hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And your village, where I know you are and where you have everybody, that is going to be the point at which the first bomb is dropped I told him that, I told him. And he said to me, and I think he actually meant it. He said to me, I understand. I understand. And I believe beyond a deal, I believe we had a real understanding. And then we had the election rigged and stolen, and now they are going wild over there. That would not have happened if I were President, would not have happened. Too bad. Too bad. We believe in patriotic education for our children. And we strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America's youth. We are not going to let it happen. We are committed to defending innocent life, protecting our constitution, and to proudly upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our nation's founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctness. We do not like political correctness. And we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture. We believe in law and order, and we respect and support the men and women of law enforcement, and above all we live by the words of our national motto and it will never ever change, In God We Trust. Sustained by these timeless American values and powered by the strength of these unstoppable ideas, we will press forward. We will have victory after victory. Never forget the heart, soul, brilliance, passion and patriotism of the young people here today. They are young, great people. And Charlie, I want to thank you. What a joy you have done, what a job you have done. And to the devoted citizens all across our country, is so much greater than our opponents can even imagine. We are there. We have massive majorities and we are much stronger than them, much stronger than them. We are much stronger than they are, because unlike their agenda, our movement is not driven by the lust for control and domination of others. Our movement is driven by a love for America and an ironclad faith in the American people. I have that faith and you have that faith. We are not fighting for socialism, communism. We are not fighting for servitude. We are fighting for God, for country and we are fighting for freedom. We know in our veins that our American inheritance was passed down to us by generations of patriots who gave everything they had, their sweat, their blood, and even their very lives to build America into the most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are not going to let it be taken away from us by a small group of radical left, Marxist maniacs. So my fellow Americans, our movement is the greatest in American history. There has never been a movement like we have had. We won the most important election, 2016. We did more than any other administration has ever done. And we did it quickly. We are not going to let it be taken away from us. The 2022 midterms are the next phase of the battle and we will not stop there. We will keep on going until we have made America great again. With your help, we will take back the House. We will take back the Senate and we will take back that beautiful, gorgeous White House. And we will take back our country. So working together, we will make America powerful again. Thank you. Thank you. The whole country is watching, the whole country is watching what you have done. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you to Turning Point.

{"id": 859, "text": "Today every man no matter where he stands stands in the center of the world. And we Americans, who want to reduce the distance between friends, believe that no man comes from so far off that he cannot find a welcome among us. So today we welcomed you as a guest in our country. And tonight we welcome you as a guest in our home. About you tonight, Mr. Chairman, though you have come from halfway across the world, you see old friends and you see others who have a deep interest in your country and want to know it better. For most of us, Burma has traditionally been a land of beauty and serenity, of golden temples, elephants, deep forests, and precious gems. But we know that behind that exotic exterior, your country is a land of hardworking people whose goals are very similar to ours. We are both family people. We love our children and we believe in living in peace with our neighbors provided they stay on their side of the fence, and out of our melon patch. As nations, too, we share common dedications: to national independence, to progress, and to peace. Both our countries emerged from a colonial past and treasure independence all the more for that. Both have been blessed by Providence with a bountiful land. On the world scene, we both place high value on the just resolution of international differences and on the search for universal peace. This search has led us along different paths for our situations and our responsibilities have not been the same. But the ultimate goal is there one in which we both can share. For our part, I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that just as we shall never shirk our responsibilities, so shall we never fail in our efforts to find a secure and just peace. For the present, the problems of our world place burdens upon us all. And we must be prepared to live with them until all nations have finally become convinced that aggression and terror have no place in human society. The day of peace will eventually come-a day when all nations will be able to live in their own way, free from threat and fear. When that day arrives, we shall be able to devote all our talents and resources to the war against the real enemies of mankind-poverty, sickness, and illiteracy in a vast cooperative effort. Thus shall we raise the hopes and enrich the lives of people throughout the world. Meanwhile, tonight in this room, we are among friends. And we should, for the moment, put aside our cares and. concerns and enjoy each other's company. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast to His Excellency, General Ne Win, Chairman of the Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentstoastdinnerhonorgeneralnewinburma", "title": "The President's Toast at a Dinner in Honor of General Ne Win of Burma", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-toast-dinner-honor-general-ne-win-burma", "publication_date": "08-09-1966", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

{"id": 705, "text": "Hello, New York! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jonathan, for your service to this country and for continuing to fight for what this country stands for, even after you had to take off the uniform. I also want to recognize the extraordinary performance of Audra McDonald. I like hearing her sing. I want to thank our emcee for this evening, Neil Patrick Harris. Everybody knows that Neil is openly terrific. Couple of other acknowledgments: Christine Quinn, the New York City council speaker, is here; a great friend of mine who helped move the process forward to make sure that do not ask, do not tell got done, Patrick Murphy is in the house; the DNC treasurer, Andy Tobias, is here--I think they like you, Andy; and I want to thank the cochairs of the LGBT Leadership Council. Thank you so much. This is just an extraordinary event. It is wonderful to be back in New York. I see a lot of new faces, but also a lot of friends who I have known for a very long time. Many of you knew me before I had gray hair. Malia and Sasha says it makes me look distinguished; Michelle says it makes me look old. Now, being here with all of you, I cannot help but think back to election night 2 1/2 years ago. We were in Grant Park; some of you were there. Beautiful night. Culmination of an extraordinary journey, a campaign that had drawn on the hard work and support of people all across the country, men and women who believed that change was possible, who believed that we did not have to accept politics as usual, who believed that we could once again be a country that lived up to our highest aspirations, not our lowest common denominators. And it was a perfect night, and we were feeling pretty good, I got to admit. But what I said then at Grant Park was that this was not the end of the road, it was just the beginning. And I said that the journey was going to be long and it was going to be difficult and there were going to be times where we stumbled, that the climb was going to be steep. Now, we did not know exactly how steep it was going to be. But we knew that it was not going to be easy to rebuild the middle class after a decade of stagnant incomes and rising costs, a decade where a lot of Americans felt like that dream was slipping away. We knew it was not going to be easy to end two wars and restore America's leadership around the world. We knew it was not going to be easy to fix our immigration system, to reform our health care system, to transform our energy policy, to educate our young people for the demands of a global economy. We did not think it was going to be easy. And I said that night, I did not run for President to do easy things. I ran because I believed that as a nation it was time for us to do the hard things. It was time for us to do the big things, even if it took time, even if sometimes it was going to be frustrating. I said I was not going to let politics or the typical Washington games stand in our way, because it had held us back for too long. That is what led to the mess that we were dealing with in the first place. So over these past 2 1/2 years, I have had some tough calls to make. I had some tough calls as soon as I took office. We had to prevent a financial system from falling apart and dragging the economy into depression. We had to pass reforms to stop abuses in the financial system and prevent future crises. We had to rescue the auto industry. I did not think I was going to be an auto CEO. Even though there were a lot of people who said, let them go, let more than a million jobs vanish, allow two of America's iconic companies to be liquidated and sold off for parts, we said, no, we are going to have to step up, we are going to have to deal with it. But even as we took these emergency steps, we started tackling all the challenges that we had talked about during the campaign, all the things that were standing in the way of the American Dream. Because that is why I ran, that is what the campaign was about. That is why you supported me, because we believed in an economy that did not just work for those at the top, but worked for everybody, where prosperity was shared from the machinist on the line to the manager on the floor to the CEO in the boardroom. We worked so hard in 2008 because we believed that we have to define our success not just by stock prices or corporate profits, but whether ordinary folks can find a good job, whether they can afford a middle class life, whether they can pay the mortgage and take care of their kids and save some money for their child's college education or their own retirement and maybe have a little left over to go to a movie or dinner or even a play--since we are in New York. That is why we cut taxes for middle class families and ended subsidies to the banks for student loans to make college more affordable. That is why I was proud to sign a bill to make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, a basic principle. That is why we are promoting manufacturing and homegrown American energy, because that is what will lead to jobs that pay a decent salary. That is why we are standing up a new consumer bureau with just one responsibility: looking out for ordinary folks in the financial system so they are not cheated. That is why we passed health reform, so that nobody in the richest nation on Earth ever has to go bankrupt because they or somebody in their family get sick. That was the right thing to do. We waged that long campaign in 2008 because we believed it was time to end the war in Iraq. And that is what we are doing, ending the war in Iraq. We removed a hundred thousand troops from Iraq already, ended combat missions there. We are on track to bring the rest of our troops home by the end of this year. I ran for President because I believed we needed to refocus our efforts in Afghanistan, and we are doing this too. We pummeled Al Qaida. We took out bin Laden. And because of our progress and the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops, we are now fulfilling the commitment I made to start reducing our troops this month so that Afghans can take responsibility for their own security. I also ran because we now live in a world where America is facing stiff competition for good jobs. There are rapidly growing nations like China and India. They are hungry; they are on the move. And for a long time, we were told that the best way to win this competition was to undermine consumer protections, undermine clean air and clean water laws, hand out tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, and everything would work out just fine. It did not work out well. In fact, if you look at our history, you will see that philosophy has never worked out very well. America was built on the hard work of people and the ingenuity of our businesses. But we also built a system of free public high schools and sent a generation to college on the GI bill. We constructed railroads and highways that spanned a continent. We invested in research and technology, and we sent a man to the Moon, and we discovered lifesaving medicine. We launched the Information Age, creating millions of jobs along the way. That is how you build a nation. That is how you build a strong middle class. And that is what we need to do today. There is an important debate in Washington right now about cutting the deficit. And it is absolutely critical that we cut the deficit. Like families all across America, Government has to live within its means. And I am prepared to bring down our deficit by trillions of dollars; that is trillions with a t. But I will not reduce our deficit by sacrificing the education of our young people. We cannot stop medical research being done by our scientists. We cannot stop building the infrastructure that made this country great. I am not going to sacrifice clean energy at a time when our dependence on foreign oil has caused Americans so much pain at the pump. That does not make any sense. In other words, I will not sacrifice America's future. What makes America great is not just the scale of our skyscrapers or our military might or the size of our GDP. What makes us great is the character of our people. Yes, we are rugged individualists, and we are self-reliant, and that is part of what makes us Americans. We do not like being told what to do. But what also makes us who we are is we have got faith in the future and we recognize that that future is shared, the notion that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper. My life is richer and stronger when everybody in the country has some measure of security, everybody has got a fair shot at the American Dream. That is what makes us great. That is our vision for America. It is not a vision of a small America. It is a vision of a big America, a compassionate America, and a bold and optimistic America. And it is a vision where we are living within our means, but we are still investing in our future. And everybody is making sacrifices, but nobody bears all the burden. An America where we live up to the idea that no matter who we are, no matter what we look like, we are connected to one another. That is what led many of us to fight so hard, to knock on so many doors and maybe harangue some of our friends, this belief that it was up to each of us to perfect this Union. It was our work to make sure that we were living up to a simple American value: We are all created equal--all created equal. Ever since I entered into public life, ever since I have a memory about what my mother taught me and my grandparents taught me, I believed that discriminating against people was wrong. I had no choice; I was born that way----in Hawaii. And I believed that discrimination because of somebody's sexual orientation or gender identity ran counter to who we are as a people, and it is a violation of the basic tenets on which this Nation was founded. I believe that gay couples deserve the same legal rights as every other couple in this country. And that is --now, there was such a good recitation earlier by Neil that I feel bad repeating it, but let me just--it bears repeating. This is why we are making sure that hospitals extended visitation rights to gay couples, because nobody should be barred from their bedside because their partner--the bedside of their partner in a moment of pain or a moment of need. Nobody should have to produce a legal contract to hold the hand of the person that they love. It is why we launched the first comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy, providing a roadmap not only to providing treatment and reducing infections, but also embracing the potential of new, groundbreaking research that will help us bring an end to this pandemic. That is why I ordered Federal agencies to extend the same benefits to gay couples that go to straight couples wherever possible. It is why we are going to keep fighting until the law no longer---- Where was I? That is why we are going to keep on fighting until the law no longer treats committed partners who have been together for decades like they are strangers. That is why I have long believed that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act ought to be repealed. It was wrong. It was unfair. And since I taught constitutional law for a while, I felt like I was in a pretty good position to agree with courts that have ruled that section 3 of DOMA violates the Constitution. And that is why we decided, with my Attorney General, that we could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA in the courts. Now, part of the reason that DOMA does not make sense is that, traditionally, marriage has been decided by the States. And right now I understand there is a little debate going on here in New York----about whether to join five other States and DC in allowing civil marriage for gay couples. And I want to say that under the leadership of Governor Cuomo, with the support of Democrats and Republicans, New York is doing exactly what democracies are supposed to do. There is a debate; there is deliberation about what it means here in New York to treat people fairly in the eyes of the law. And that is--look, that is the power of our democratic system. It is not always pretty. There are setbacks. There are frustrations. But in grappling with tough and, at times, emotional issues in legislatures and in courts and at the ballot box, and yes, around the dinner table and in the office hallways, and sometimes even in the Oval Office, slowly but surely we find the way forward. That is how we will achieve change that is lasting, change that just a few years ago would have seemed impossible. Now, let me just say this. There were those who doubted that we'd be able to pass a hate crimes law. Occasionally, I got hollered at about that. After a decades-long fight, we got it done, bringing us closer to the day when nobody is going to be afraid to walk down the street because they are gay or transgender. There were those said we could not end do not ask, do not tell. And I remember having events where folks hollered out at events. But we passed the repeal. We got it done. We are now moving forward with implementing it. So we are no longer going to demand brave and patriotic Americans live a lie to serve their country. Folks like Captain Jonathan Hopkins, who led a platoon into northern Iraq during the initial invasion and quelled an ethnic riot and earned a Bronze Star with valor. He was discharged, only to receive e-mails and letters from his soldiers saying, if they had known he was gay all along--that they had known he was gay all along and they still thought he was the best commander they had ever had. That is how progress is being won here in New York, around the country. Day by day, it is won by ordinary people who are striving and fighting and protesting for change and who, yes, are keeping the pressure up, including pressure on me. And by men and women who are setting an example in their own lives: raising their families, doing their jobs, joining the PTA, singing in church, serving and sacrificing for this country overseas, even as they are not always granted the full rights of citizenship they deserve here at home. Last year, I received a letter from a teenager growing up in a small town, and he told me he was a senior in high school, and that he was proud to be the captain of a club at his school, and that he was gay. And he had not told his parents. He had not come out. He was worried about being mocked or being bullied. He did not think it was safe to, in his words, openly be myself. But this 17-year-old also looked towards the day when he did not have to be afraid, when he did not have to worry about walking down the hallway. And he closed his letter by saying: Everyone else is considered equal in this country. Why should not we be? So yes, we have more work to do. Yes, we have more progress to make. Yes, I expect continued impatience with me on occasion. But understand this--look, I think of teenagers like the one who wrote me, and they remind me that there should be impatience when it comes to the fight for basic equality. We have made enormous advances just in these last 2 1/2 years. But there are still young people out there looking for us to do more, to help build a world in which they never have to feel afraid or alone to be themselves. And we know how important that is to not only tell them that it is going to get better, but to also do everything in our power to ensure that things actually are better. I am confident that we will achieve the equality that this young person deserves. I am confident that the future is bright for that teenager and others like him and that he can have the life that he wants and that he imagines. There will be setbacks along the way. There will be times where things are not moving as fast as folks would like. But I know that he will look back on his struggles and the struggles of many in this room, as part of what made change possible, part of what it took to reach the day when every single American, gay or straight or lesbian or bisexual or transgender, was free to live and love as they see fit. And we can look at the progress we have made in the last 2 years, to the changes that were led not by Washington, but by folks standing up for themselves or for their sons or for their daughters, fighting for what is right. Not just change on behalf of gay Americans, but for everybody looking to fulfill their version of the American Dream. Whether it is the students working their way through college or the workers heading to factories to build American cars again or the energy entrepreneurs testing bold ideas, the construction crews laying down roads, the small-business owners and scientists and inventors and builders and all those Americans who faced hardship and setbacks, but who never stopped believing in this country, its capacity to change, who are helping each and every day to rebuild this Nation so that we emerge from this period of struggle stronger and more unified than ever before. And that is the story of progress in America--that is what all of you represent--of the stubborn refusal to accept anything less than the best that this country can be. And with your help, if you keep up the fight, and if you will devote your time and your energies to this campaign one more time, I promise you, we will write another chapter in that story. And we are going to leave a new generation with a brighter future and a more hopeful future. And I will be standing there, right there with you. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraisernewyorkcity4", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Fundraiser in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-national-committee-fundraiser-new-york-city-4", "publication_date": "23-06-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 576, "text": "Good afternoon. I am coming to you from aboard the United States ship Theodore Roosevelt, which left yesterday from Norfolk, Virginia, on a 6-month mission. What I have seen on this ship today only increases my pride not only in the sailors and marines I met but also in every soldier, every sailor, every airman, every marine who serves our Nation, from Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Germany, where Americans are leaving to airdrop lifesaving supplies into Bosnia, to Somalia, where our Armed Forces have served with great distinction and made every American proud. I am honored to join you on Armed Forces Radio. I have had many blessings this year: the privilege of meeting Americans all across our Nation, the opportunity to hear about their lives and their dreams for our future, and of course, the opportunity to become the President of the United States. But there is no greater honor than actually serving as America's Commander in Chief. Your work is often dangerous, even when times are quiet. Your day at the office can be 6 months or longer. And it is not for the money, it is always for the country. Because America's Armed Forces are more than the backbone of our security, you are the shining model of our best values: dedication and responsibility and the willingness of you and your loved ones to bear a tremendous level of sacrifice. You commit your daily energies and even your lives to benefit your fellow Americans. Our armed services stand as one of history's great successes. Every color, every background, every region of our society is represented in America's Armed Forces. The American military pioneered our Nation's progress toward integration and equal opportunity. It is America's most effective education and training system. It is constantly adapted to change and always rising to the challenge of change. You, and all who wear America's uniforms, are what make the United States a true superpower. It is your skill, your professionalism, your courage, and your dedication to country and service that constitutes the muscle, the sinew, and the soul of our strength. And today I salute you. I want to say a special word about the Navy since I am on board this fine ship today. It means a lot to a Commander in Chief to have a ready fleet. When word of a crisis breaks out in Washington, it is no accident that the first question is: Where is the nearest carrier? This ship's namesake, President Theodore Roosevelt, once said, The Navy of the United States is the right arm of the United States and is emphatically the peacemaker. Theodore Roosevelt was the first American ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize, in part with the help of the United States Navy. We have a great stake, you and I, in maintaining a strong American defense and in working hard even at the end of the cold war. The Theodore Roosevelt played an important part in the end of the cold war. In 1988, it was here that an American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff first welcomed his Soviet counterpart to visit an American aircraft carrier. That was when my friend Admiral William Crowe and Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev stepped aboard this ship to meet the crew and watch flight operations just as I have done today. It was a key milestone on the path to the end of the cold war. Less than 5 years later, the world has changed, faster than anyone could have possibly guessed. The cold war is over. The Soviet Union no longer exists. The Warsaw Pact is gone. The specter of Soviet tanks rolling westward across the northern German plains no longer haunts us. But the world remains a dangerous and increasingly an uncertain place. Saddam Hussein confirmed that. The tragic violence in Bosnia reminds us of that every day. The proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is unfortunately a growing, not a receding, menace. And human suffering, such as that in Somalia, may not threaten our shores but still requires us to act. These challenges are new in many ways, but we dare not overlook their significance. Blinders never provide security. A changed security environment demands that we change our security arrangement. Yes, we are reducing the defense budget because of the end of the cold war, but we are not downsizing for its own sake, we are trying to rightsize our security for security's sake. And as we change, we must keep a few core ideas in mind: Our military first must be exceptionally mobile, with first-rate sealift, airlift, and ability to project power. Our military must be agile, with an emphasis on maneuver, on speed, and on technological superiority. Our firepower must be precise so that we can minimize the exposure to harm for men and women who wear our uniform and reduce civilian casualties. Our military must be flexible so that we can operate with diverse coalition partners in different parts of the world. Our forces must be smart with the intelligence and communications we need for complex threats. And above all, our military must be ever-ready, given the unpredictability of new threats. None of these goals are possible without a quality force. The people on this ship and all of you who are listening to me exemplify that quality. It is your skills, your experience, your training, and your dedication that will get the job done for America and guarantee that our vital interests can be protected. While all of you carry out your mission so far from home, we back home will be engaged in many debates on defense policy. I will tell you that there are changes which lie ahead. Defense cuts are, and have been for the last several years, a fact of life, an inescapable consequence of the new world you have worked so hard to create. As you watch the news or read newspapers, you will hear us talk of new roles and missions and you will see news about bases and budget cuts. But as we reduce defense spending, we must not leave the men and women who won the cold war out in the cold. As these bases close, as close some of them must, we must not close our eyes and our hearts to the need for new investments and a need to create new jobs in communities with old bases. Defense spending has been declining since 1986, but there is been no real plan about what to do on it, no real plan for military personnel mustered out, no real plan for civilian workers who have lost their jobs or for the communities who have been hurt or for the companies who have been devastated. We cannot repeal the laws of change, but we do have a choice: We can be buffeted by change, or we can act boldly to use this change to make our country stronger and safer and smarter. That is why it is so important to make the investments we need in defense conversion, in education and training and new jobs in new industries. I want to help ensure that those of you who choose to leave the military in the years to come return to a nation of jobs and growth and opportunity. As you follow the news of all these changes, I ask you to remember this: I am immensely proud of who you are and what you are doing. And as these changes proceed I pledge that as long as I am your President, you and the other men and women in uniform will continue to be the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped Fighting force in the world. There is no single decision I take more seriously than those involving the use of force. As I weigh crises that confront America around the world, you will be in my mind and in my heart. This is, on balance, a very hopeful time. But still, it is full of challenges. We can be glad that your mission is not darkly framed by the cold war's confrontation with a nuclear adversary. But many new duties and dangers are taking the place of that single stark threat, some of them yet unknown. There is no sonar, no radar that can enable us to fathom all the changes in terrain over which we are about to set sail. Napoleon had a standing order to his corps commanders to, quote, March to the sound of the gun. He meant that when the shooting starts on a battlefield, it is the soldier's obligation to move into the fight. Today, there are many different security challenges into which we must all move. And at times, you who serve our Nation in uniform may be called upon to answer not only the sound of guns but also the call of distress, or a summons to keep the peace in a troubled part of the world, or even the cry of starving children. The cause may be more diverse, but our values must remain unchanged, our purposes clear. And your commitment to serve remains the linchpin in every new and continuing effort. I know that for some of you listening to me today, this is a difficult time. You have left your family, your friends, your home. I hope you understand that your work is vitally important to your fellow Americans and to the President and to this very new and very hopeful world we are trying to nourish and to build. The American people have great faith in what you do. Their faith is well placed, and I thank you for your service.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthearmedforces", "title": "Radio Address to the Armed Forces", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-armed-forces", "publication_date": "12-03-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 718, "text": "Hello, Pittsburgh! It is good to be back in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, one of my favorite people, one of our finest United States Senators, give it up for Bob Casey. I think we have got in the house as well your mayor, Luke Ravenstahl. Congressman Mike Doyle is in the house. Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald is here. The Pennsylvania Democratic State Party chair, Jim Burn, is here. And we want to thank Sheryl Sesay and Monte Reid for the preprogram. Great job. Great job. Now, I first of all, before we do anything else But let us also be clear that a very important situation has arisen: The White Sox and the Pirates are in first place. So we may be in the World Series together. We love each other, we can root for each other until we get to the World Series. Then it is every man for himself. I know it is hot. I know you guys have been waiting a while. So I just so I want to, first of all, just say thank you to everybody for taking the time to be here. I hope everybody had a great Fourth of July. We had some folks over for a barbecue in my backyard had some fireworks. It was also Malia's birthday on the Fourth. She is now 14 years old. It goes by too quick. I used to be able to convince her that all these fireworks were for her, but she no longer believes me. But she sends her love, and Michelle and Sasha and Bo all say hi. Now, some of you may know that we have been on the bus tour for the last couple of days. I have been traveling through Ohio. We came just came from Beaver, Pennsylvania. And everywhere I go, people have said, Mr. President, you are getting too skinny, you need to eat. And so we have been eating a lot. And I have had a chance to talk to folks everywhere I go, and people are aware of the fact that we are now in full campaign swing. And I know that sometimes modern campaigns are not pretty to watch, because basically, so much of it involves millions of dollars on television. Most of the ads are negative, and at a certain point, people get discouraged and start feeling like nobody in Washington's listening to what is going on to ordinary folks all across the country. But I have got to tell you, despite the cynicism and the negativism, what I am what I think about is my first race. And what What I think about is my first race. And this is when I was first running for State senate; I could not afford television commercials. And Michelle and I, we used to go door to door and pass out flyers that we had printed out in Kinko's. And we had our friends and our family members, and we'd march in Fourth of July parades. And it was hard work. And I did not have Air Force One back then. But when I think about my first race, I think about why I got into politics. And the reason I got into politics was because this country has blessed me so much. And I thought about my own family, how my grandfather fought in Patton's army in World War II while my grandmother was back home working on a bomber assembly line. And when my grandfather came back, he was able to go to college on the GI bill, and they were able to buy a home through the FHA. And then, I thought about my single mom because my dad left when I was very young and how, despite all the struggles, she was able to get a great education because that is the kind of country this was. And she was able to pass on a great education to me and my sister. And then, I think about Michelle's mom, and the fact that Michelle's mom and dad, they did not come from a wealthy family. Michelle's dad, he worked a blue-collar job at the sanitary plant in Chicago. And my mother-in-law, she stayed at home until the kids got older. And she ended up becoming a secretary, and that is what she worked at most of her life, was a secretary at a bank. So none of us came from privileged backgrounds, none of us had a lot of wealth or fame. But what we understood was that here in America, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what church you worship at, no matter what region of the country, if you were willing to work hard, if you were willing to take responsibility for your life, you could make it if you try here in the United States of America. And that basic idea, that basic bargain that says here we all deserve a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same set of rules; that basic bargain that says if you are willing to work hard and take responsibility in your own life, then you can find a job that pays a living wage and you can save up and buy a home and you will not go bankrupt if you get sick. Maybe you can take a vacation with your family once in a while. Nothing fancy, but you can go out and go visit some of our national parks or I remember my favorite vacation when I was a kid, traveling with my mom and my grandma and my sister, and we traveled the country on Greyhound buses and railroads. And once in a while, we'd rent a car not that often and stay at Howard Johnsons and did not matter how big the pool was; if there was a pool, I'd jump in. I was 11 years old, and I was excited just to go to the vending machine and get the ice bucket and get the ice. And then, the chance to retire with dignity and respect, that dream of a strong middle class, that is what America has always been about. That is what led me to get into public service. That is what led to my first campaign, was making sure that access to that middle class that growing, thriving heartbeat of America that that was available for everybody, that it was not just available for me and Michelle, but it was available for every kid all across this country. And that is what led me to run for ENTITY. And that is what is led me to ask you for a second term as ENTITY, to fight for America's middle class and everybody who is trying to get into the middle class. That idea has been getting battered a little bit over the last decade. Part of the reason I ran in 2008, part of the reason so many of you came together to work on that campaign, was we had seen a decade in which those middle class dreams were under assault. Folks were working harder, but making less. Costs of everything from health care to college to groceries to gas kept on going up, but your salaries or your wages did not . We had put two wars on a credit card, taken a surplus and turned it into a deficit, and all of it culminated in the worst financial crisis that we have seen in our lifetimes. So what we came together to do in 2008 was start this process this painstaking, laborious process to turn this country back towards those core values, to turn this country back towards our best selves and our best ideals. And we knew we would not be able to do it overnight because these problems were not created overnight. But we believed in this country, and we believed in the American people. We understood that this has never been a country of folks looking for handouts, but what they do want is a fighting chance. And so, for the last 3 years, when some folks said, let us let Detroit go bankrupt we said, no, we are betting on the American worker. We are betting on the American industries. And now GM is back at number one, and Chrysler and Ford are back. And we have started to see manufacturing come back to our shores, more manufacturing jobs created than any time since the 1990s. We saw people go back and get retrained for jobs, sometimes getting jobs of the future: advanced manufacturing, new technologies, and clean energy. We have seen small businesses who almost had to shutter their doors during the crisis, but sometimes, the owners did not take a salary because they wanted to keep their folks working. And somehow, inch by inch, yard by yard, mile by mile, they have been able to come all the way back and are now starting to hire workers again: over 4.4 million jobs created over the last 2 1/2 years, over 500,000 manufacturing jobs. So we have been fighting back, but what we all understand is that we have got so much more to do. Too many of our friends and family members and neighbors are still out of work; too many folks still are seeing their home property values underwater. And so the question for all of you at this moment is, how will we determine our direction, not just for the next year, not just for the next 5 years, but for the next decade, the next two decades? Because this election is not just about two candidates or two parties; it is about two fundamentally different visions of where we take America. And the stakes could not be higher. And ultimately, the way we are going to make this decision is you. There is a stalemate in Washington right now because there are two different visions of how we have to move forward, and you have got to break that stalemate. So let me just very briefly tell you what the choices are. You have got Mr. Romney and his allies in Congress. And their basic vision is one that says we are going to give $5 trillion of new tax cuts on top of the Bush tax cuts, most of them going to the wealthiest Americans. They will not be paid for, or if they are paid for, they will be paid for by slashing education funding or making college loans more expensive or eliminating support for basic science and research, the kind of work that is done right here at Carnegie Mellon or making Medicare a voucher system. So that is one part of their plan. And the second part of their plan is, let us eliminate regulations: regulations that we just put in place to make sure that Wall Street does not act recklessly and we can prevent another taxpayer-funded bailout when the financial system goes out of whack, regulations that protect our air or our water, regulations that protect consumers from being taken advantage of. And that is it. That is their economic plan. Do not take my word for it, go on their website. The Republicans in Congress voted for this plan. And you know what, it is a theory. It is an idea of how you might grow an economy if we had not just tried it for 10 years before I took office. We tried it, and it did not work. So why would we want to go backwards to the same theory that did not work before? They are banking on the notion that you do not remember what happened when they were in charge the last time they were in charge of the White House and how surpluses became deficits and how job growth was more sluggish than it is been in 50 years and how we ultimately ended up with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Well, Pittsburgh, I want you to know I have got a different theory. I have got a different idea. And let me be honest, it is not a silver bullet. It is not going to change things completely in the next day or the next week. But it moves us in a direction that is true to our traditions by building not from the top down, but from the middle class out. It is a vision that says we do not need to just bring automaking back, we can bring manufacturing back to America. We can invest in advanced manufacturing research like is being done right here at Carnegie Mellon. And we can change our Tax Code to make sure, instead of giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas, let us give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in Pittsburgh, right here in Pennsylvania, right here in the United States of America. That is my vision for the future. My vision is one that says we have got to invest in our young people so they get the best education in the world. So I want to hire new teachers, especially in math and science. I want to keep on making college more affordable. We just prevented Congress from doubling student interest loan rates because of you. But we have got to do more to bring tuition down and give 2 million more Americans the chance to study at community colleges and get the job training they need for the jobs of the 21st century. Because a higher education is not an economic luxury, it is an economic necessity. And I am committed to making sure everybody gets that chance for the skills and the trainings they need to succeed. My vision says we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and we are winding down the war in Afghanistan. So let us take half of that money that we are saving in war and use it to pay down the deficit. Let us take the other half and do some nation-building here at home. Let us put some Americans back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our schools. Let us build broadband lines and wireless networks and high-speed rail. Let us invest in the basic science and research that helped to send a man to the Moon and create the Internet. That is what makes America great. We are innovators and risk takers. I believe in an America in which we control our own energy future. We are producing more oil than we have in the last 8 years; we are importing less. But we can do so much more. We have got to bet on not just an oil industry that is already profitable. We have got to bet on a clean energy industry of solar and wind that can create jobs and help our environment and free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil. And I have got a vision that believes that everybody, all families who are responsible, should be able to have the basic security of health care. The Supreme Court has spoken: The law we passed is here to stay. If you have health insurance, the only thing that changes for you is you are more secure because insurance companies cannot drop you when you get sick. They do not have a lifetime limit where suddenly they are dumping the costs on you, even though you have been paying your premiums. We have got millions of young people who are able to stay on their parent's plan right now because of that health care law. We have got millions of seniors who are seeing cheaper prescription drugs. And if you do not have health insurance, we are going to help you get health insurance. I believe it was the right thing to do because that is part of making sure a middle class is thriving in this country, that they do not have to fear that when somebody in their family gets sick, that somehow they are going to lose everything they have worked for all those years. I make no apologies for it. It was the right thing to do. And we are going to keep moving forward. That is why I am running for a second term as ENTITY. We are not going to go back to a vision that somehow thinks when a few wealthy investors do well, then everybody does well. So you know what, we need to deal with our deficit. We need to deal with our debt. And part of America's character is the understanding that government cannot solve every problem. We do not expect it to. Some folks cannot be helped if they do not want to help themselves. Not every government program works. We have already cut a trillion dollars in spending that was not helping families succeed, and we will do some more. But you know what, we are not just going to cut and balance the budget on the backs of middle class families, asking them to pay more taxes, asking them to suddenly not get help when it comes to sending their kids to college. I think we can ask wealthiest Americans to do a little bit more. We need to have a Tax Code where secretaries are not paying a lower tax rate than their bosses. And you know what, the good news is there are a lot of Americans all across the country very successful Americans who agree with me on this, because they understand the only reason they succeeded was somebody helped them. Did not give them a handout, but gave them a hand up. This idea that we are all in it together, that we rise or fall as one people, that theory of mine about how to grow the economy, we have tried that too. We tried it as recently as when Bill Clinton was President. And you know what, we created 23 million new jobs, and we had a surplus at the end of it instead of a deficit. And we created a whole lot of wealth and a lot of millionaires along the way. Because that formula that says we are in it together means that everybody can do well. The reason we built the Hoover Dam or the Golden Gate Bridge, the reason we sent a man to the Moon or invested in the research that resulted in the Internet, the reason we built an Interstate Highway System, we did those things not for any individual to become rich. We did it so that all of us would have a platform for success, because we understand there are some things we do better together. I continue to believe that. I think most Americans understand that. That is the reason I am running for a second term as ENTITY. Now, over the next 4 months, you are going to see more money spent than you have ever seen before, more negative ads. These guys are writing $10 million checks. And you will hear the same thing from them over and over again, because they know that their economic theory is not going to sell, so all they have got to argue is, the economy is not moving as fast as it needs to, jobs are not growing as fast as they need to, and it is all Obama's fault. That is basically their only message. Now, I guess this is a plan to win an election, but it is not a plan to create jobs. It is not a plan to grow our middle class. And you know what, I might be worried about all this money being spent if it was not for my memories of previous campaigns. That first campaign I ran, the last campaign I ran in 2008, I have been outspent before. I have had a lot of money thrown at me before. But you know what I have learned, is that when the American people decide on what is right, when all of you decide on what is true, when you remember the story of your families just like the story of my families, all the struggles our parents and our grandparents and great-grandparents went through some of them maybe came over here as immigrants and started working in the mines or working in the mills, not always knowing what to expect, but understanding that there was something different about this country, looking out for one another, taking care of the community together, being responsible, having those old-fashioned, homespun values, believing that being middle class was not a matter of your bank account, it was a state of mind in terms of what you believe, that there were some things that were important and nothing was more important than looking after your family and being with your family and caring for your family when Americans come together and tap into that spirit that is best in us, all that money does not matter. All those negative ads do not matter. You make change happen. You inspire each other. You inspire me. In 2008, I told you I am not a perfect man and I would not be a perfect ENTITY. But I told you I'd always tell you what I thought and I'd always tell you where I stood. And I told you I would wake up every single day fighting as hard as I knew how for you, to make your lives a little bit better, to give you more of a fighting shot to succeed and live out your dreams. And I made that promise because I saw myself in you. In your grandparents, I see my grandparents. In your children, I see Malia and Sasha. And I have kept that promise. I have kept that promise. Every morning and every night, I have thought about how we build America and how we build America's middle class and how we give everybody a fair shot and how we make sure everybody's doing their fair share and how we make sure everybody's fighting by the same rules. And if you still believe in me like I believe in you, I hope you will stand with me in 2012. Because if you do, we will finish what we started in 2008, and this economy will be moving again.

{"id": 814, "text": "Thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank all the previous speakers for saying everything that needs to be said; I am free to say whatever I like. I am deeply indebted, as all of you know, to this city and this State for many things, the most important of which is clearly the First Lady, who asked me to be remembered to all of you tonight. I have a picture on my wall in my office of Hillary and me on St. Patrick's Day in 1992 in Chicago that was the night of the primaries in Illinois and Michigan, the night we knew that unless the wheel completely ran off, I would probably become the nominee of our party. And from that day and before to this, no place has been better to us and to the Vice President and to our whole team than the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois. And I am profoundly grateful to all of you, and I thank you for it. I also want to say a word of appreciation to Steve Grossman, who has done a magnificent job. I thank Congressman Rangel, who has to put on his uniform every day. He is now in the most severe combat he is been in since the Korean war, I think, with the Republicans in the House, but he holds up his end right well. And I thank you, Charles. I am proud of you in every way. I want to thank Secretary Daley, who will soon get over being 50. Oh, to be 50 again. It is all a matter of perspective, you know. I want to thank Mayor Daley for his leadership here and his support and friendship. I thank Senator Durbin for many things and for being so courageous in his leadership to protect our children against the dangers of tobacco, to keep our streets and our communities safe, and many other things. I want to say a little more about Carol Moseley-Braun in a moment. I want to thank Reverend Jesse Jackson for being a good friend of my family in personal as well as political ways, and for doing a superb job for our country as our Special Envoy to Africa, a very important part of America's future. Thank you, Reverend Jackson, for doing that. Now, you heard all the politics. I would like to talk a little bit about specifically about Illinois and how if fits into the larger picture of America and our future. I ran for President because I honestly believed our country was not doing what was necessary to prepare for a new century, a new millennium, a completely new way of living and working and relating to each other and the rest of the world. And I think that what we have sought to do is best captured in the theme the First Lady picked for our Millennium Project, the things we are doing over the next 2 1/2 years to celebrate the coming of a new century and a new millennium. The theme is Honoring the past; imagining the future. And that is what we have tried to do: to offer new ideas based on our oldest values; to deepen the meaning of our freedom; to widen the circle of opportunity; to build the bonds of our Union stronger; to help America be the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world; to give our children all our children the best chance to live out their dreams any generation of children has ever known. That is what we have worked on doing. Now, all those words sound good, and it is an important thing, words. They spark ideas. They spark the human spirit. They motivate people to act. But in the end, you have to turn the words into action. And I would like to just give you one example. The lion's share of credit for the economic statistics the Vice President reeled off belongs to the American people, to their hard work, their ingenuity, their good citizenship. But the policies of this administration have plainly played a role in giving people the tools to do what has been done and creating the conditions for success. If it had not been for Carol Moseley-Braun or Glenn Poshard or Charlie Rangel or Al Gore, the economic plan in 1993 which drove interest rates down, drove the deficit down, got investment up, expanded our commitment to promote economic opportunity in the inner cities, including in Chicago would not have passed, because it passed by one vote in both Houses, because every single member of the other party voted against it. And I want to tell you that I am proud to be a member of my party and proud to be an ardent supporter of the reelection of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and the election of Glenn Poshard. There is I was told today when I came into Chicago that Congressman Poshard's opponent has an ad on attacking him for voting for our 1993 economic plan, claiming it was a big tax increase, neglecting to point out that income taxes were raised on about two-tenths of a percent of the American people, that 5 times as many people in Illinois got a tax cut as got a tax increase working families who need it the most and that that bill lowered the deficit 92 percent before the bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed and, therefore, was the single most important vote to the economic recovery America enjoys today. I think Glenn Poshard should thank his opponent for advertising for him. It is a good difference between Republicans and Democrats. They are still trying to mischaracterize the bill that brought America back. And I hope you will send a message on election day, by reelecting Carol Moseley-Braun and electing Glenn Poshard, that Illinois likes this economy and will support people who brought it about. We have the lowest crime rate in 25 years. The crime bill of 1994 played a major role in that, with 100,000 police on the street and grants to communities like Chicago not just to punish people but to give our young people something to say yes to, so that more communities could have more programs like your afterschool programs here and your summer school programs here. And most of the members, not all but most of the members of the other party voted against it. Carol Moseley-Braun and Glenn Poshard voted for it. And so, if you like the fact that Chicago has all these new police officers under the crime bill and you like what has been done here to make the streets safer, I think you should show that you like it when words are turned into action by voting to reelect Carol Moseley-Braun and to elect Glenn Poshard. I think these are the kinds of things that you have to say to people. Now, as the Vice President said, we have to decide what we are going to do with the good times we have. We are sobered and humbled when our friends in Asia, who once we thought would never have any economic problems again, have their own struggles. But we should be humbled because, when things change fast, the ground can move, and the world is changing very fast. We are heartbroken at what has happened in Africa to our Embassies, the tragic loss of life of American public servants and the more than 200 Africans who have died now and thousands wounded because some terrorist criminal wanted to hurt America. But this reminds us that freedom is a precious thing, prosperity is a wonderful thing, but in a dynamic world they bring responsibilities. And this election year should not be about negative 30-second ads, or all the mean things they have said about me or the rest of you, or any mean thing we can say back to them. It really ought to be about what do we do now. We have been given the gift of this moment of prosperity, which gives us confidence and energy. What do we do with it? What have you done in the times in your life when you thought everything was hunkydory? After things have been tough and they were tough for America for a long time the natural thing to do is to sort of say, Man, I have been working like crazy. This is great. Leave me alone. Give me a break. That was really, in fairness, the import behind the quote by the Speaker that the Vice President read, We do not really have to do anything. We just have to avoid another shutdown and get out of town. And things are so good, and we have got more money than the Democrats do. We will be fine in the election. We will worry about all of this tomorrow. And that is playing into what is often the dominant feeling in human nature. I suggest to you it would be a mistake for us to have that attitude today as a nation and that instead we ought to say, Hey, we may not get a time this good again for a while. Let us take this time to think about the big, long-term challenges this country faced, and let us go on and face them and deal with them now. If not now, when? If we cannot do it now, when will we ever have a better time? And that is what we ought to be thinking about now. So I will tell you what I think they are, in no particular order you may have different rank order. They have been alluded to already, but let me just tell you because this is why it is important to have people in the positions of Congressmen and Senators who will make good decisions about this. One of the biggest challenges this country is going to face every advanced country is going to face it is when all the baby boomers retire. I know; I am the oldest of the baby boomers. I am the oldest man my age in America now. Think about that. Because we are the biggest group of Americans ever to live, until this group of kids that just started school last year, when we retire, at present rates of retirement, birth rates, and immigration rates, for the first time since Social Security came in there will only be about two people working for every one person eligible for Social Security. The system we have, that has literally on its own lifted half of our elderly people out of poverty, is unsustainable as it is. But it has done a lot of good for the elderly, for the disabled, for children whose parents die when they are still children. So one of the things that we have to do and we ought to do it early next year we ought to stop fooling around with it. The longer we wait, the harder it will be. We are prosperous now. We are confident now. We should reform Social Security to preserve its best characteristics and make sure it will survive into the 21st century. You have to decide, who do you think you want to do that? And do not you want somebody that will come in there and keep the very best of the system but have the courage to tell you what changes have to be made now? The same thing is true of Medicare. We have to do that. It is a big challenge. That is why I have said, Let us do not spend any of this surplus on a spending program or a tax cut that I like, even something I would dearly love to do. Let us do not do that until we know we have done what is necessary to save Social Security for the 21st century. Now, it is election year. It is popular to say, I want to give you a tax cut, or I am going to give you a new program, and we are going to have a surplus, and it is projected to be such and such. Well, let me tell you, we will not even have the surplus until October 1st. And we have been waiting for 29 years to get out of the red. I'd just kind of like to look at the black ink for just a few months before we go squander this money that we do not even have yet. And I think down deep inside you and every other responsible person in Illinois, Republican, Democrat, or independent, knows that is the right thing to do. So go out and say, we ought to save Social Security first, and you are for that. I think everybody in America knows we have got the best system of higher education in the world. And one of my proudest achievements as President is that, working with the Congress, we have opened the doors wider than ever before with the HOPE scholarships, the Pell grants, the work-study grants, letting people deduct the interest on their student loans, all of the things that we have done. No one believes we have got the best elementary and secondary education in the world for all our children yet. No one believes that, because it is not true. But we need it. And I have given this Congress an agenda for smaller classes in the early grades and more teachers and modernized schools, whether we are repairing old schools or building new ones, and connecting all the classrooms to the Internet and providing for better trained teachers and raising standards and trying to support things like the mayor's reforms here in Chicago, including more afterschool programs and more summer school programs. And that school construction and repair initiative would not be a part of my program if it were not for Carol Moseley-Braun. And it ought to pass, and if you reelect her, you will send a loud message to Washington that you believe it ought to. It is an important issue. We just glanced over the Patients' Bill of Rights today. You know, there are 160 million Americans in managed care. And when Hillary and I told the American people we had to find a way, because managed care was growing, to allow people to be in managed care to control costs, but we ought to make health care affordable and available and quality for all Americans, we were attacked by our adversaries, saying we wanted to have the Government take over health care. I will tell you something interesting. When they attacked me for that, 40 cents on the dollar of health care dollars came from public sources. Do you know what it is today? Forty-seven cents, not 40. Do you know why? Because employers cannot afford to buy health insurance, so they do not cover their employees, and more and more people even in the work force are eligible for Government-funded programs today. But 160 million Americans in Medicare our Patients' Bill of Rights is the next big item on the health care agenda. Why? Because we think that it is a good thing to manage health care costs and control them, but you ought to be able to go to an emergency room if you get hurt, without having to lay there on the gurney. How would you feel if somebody in your family were in a car wreck, lying in an emergency room on a gurney, and you are trying to call the insurance company to get authorization? We believe if somebody needs a specialist, they ought to be able to get a specialist. And if the doctor believes that, he ought to be free to say so. That is what we believe. We believe if a woman is 6 months pregnant and her employer changes insurance carriers, she ought not to have to give up her obstetrician before the baby's born. Or if somebody is taking chemotherapy and they are 80 percent of the way through and the same thing happens, they ought to be able to stay with their oncologist until the treatment is over. But it does not always happen today. That is what this Patients' Bill of Rights is about. It is about common sense, balancing of the need to control costs on the one hand with the need never to forget that the health care of the American people comes first. We are for that. We have a few a very few Republicans who are helping, and God bless them, including the physician representing the State of Iowa in the House of Representatives, a brave man, Congressman Ganske. But the leadership of the other party is against this, and what they would do would make it weaker. We believe, with all this stuff being computerized, you ought to have more privacy in your medical records, not less. And I think most of you think that. That is what the Patients' Bill of Rights is about. Carol Moseley-Braun is for it; the leadership of the other party is against it. On that ground alone you should make sure she gets reelected. This is a big battle for how you and your families and your children will live in the 21st century. I could go right down the list with the environment; with the need for us to build one America working together; with the need to provide more economic opportunity in inner cities, isolated rural areas where there has been no opportunity; and with the need for America to fulfill its responsibilities. The Vice President made the remarks about the International Monetary Fund and the U.N. You know, Reverend Jackson and I and the First Lady and a big delegation, we just went to Africa not very long ago. Believe it or not, several of those African economies are growing at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 percent a year. They want to buy our products. They want to be our partners. An investment there today will pay our children many times over in return tomorrow. All over the world, people still look to us to take the lead to stand against the kind of terrorism that we experienced just a few days ago; to stand against the kind of racial and ethnic and religious hatreds that we see in places like Bosnia, that are the part of the process of peace in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. And if we want to be a source of peace and freedom and prosperity all around the world, then we have to have people who will say in Congress, I realize it is not free. I am prepared to invest in it and go home to my hometown in the heartland of America and say it is important. You know why it is important in Illinois? How many people do you believe, if you went down to the central part of this State and said, Do you know what the IMF is? could give you an answer? Or, It is the International Monetary Fund; do you know what it does? They might not know, but here is why it matters. The International Monetary Fund provides funds to countries in economic trouble in return for their willingness to undertake disciplined steps to improve reform and grow their economies. Why does that matter to you? We export half of our wheat and our corn half of it. Forty percent of all of that goes to Asia. Today, the exports to Asia are down 30 percent. It is costing the farmers of Illinois a pretty penny because there is a deep, profound economic crisis in Asia. And that will cost the people who do business with the farmers in Illinois a pretty penny. But the United States is strong, and we should be leading. We should not be looking for excuses not to assume our responsibility. We should be leading. Now, those are the big things. So I ask you to think big, be big. But remember, with every high-flown idea, with every passionate phrase, in the end, as Governor Cuomo used to say, you have to turn the poetry of a campaign into the prose of daily work. We must turn these passionate ideas into action. That is what this administration has been about. That is what Carol Moseley-Braun has helped us to do. That is what Charles Rangel has helped us to do. That is why I hope you are here. And I would implore you to go out of here with a great deal of pride and energy and determination. And when somebody asks you, Why did you go to that Democratic fundraiser? you can say, Because I am for saving Social Security and Medicare for the 21st century; because I am going to keep working until our schools are the best in the world; because I want American health care to be affordable and available and quality for all of our citizens; because I want to grow the economy and preserve the environment; because I want us to be one America, across all the lines that divide us; and because I still believe our best days are ahead as long as we are willing to stand up against the terrorists and stand up for freedom.

{"id": 962, "text": "Mr. Speaker. Thank you. You can smile. It is okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Please. Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman good to see you guys up there members of Congress And, by the way, Chief Justice, I may need a court order. She gets to go to the game tomorr- next week. I have to stay home. We got to work something out here. Members of the Cabinet, leaders of our military, Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court, and to you, my fellow Americans: You know, I start tonight by congratulating the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. Speaker, I do not want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you. And I want to congratulate the new Leader of the House Democrats, the first African American Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries. He won despite the fact I campaigned for him. Congratulations to the longest-serving Leader in the history of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell. Where are you, Mitch? And congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another you know, another term as Senate Minority Leader. You know, I think you only this time you have a slightly bigger majority, Mr. Leader. And you are the Majority Leader. About that much bigger? Yeah. Well, I tell you what I want to give specolec- special recognition to someone who I think is going to be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of the House of Representatives: Nancy Pelosi. Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never, ever giving up. It is a story unique among all nations. We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis we have ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that is what we are doing again. Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight, after we have created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs more jobs created in two years than any President has created in four years because of you all, because of the American people. Two years ago and two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much. And today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. And today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America and they do, believe it or not I say I can define it in one word, and I mean this: possibilities. We do not think anything is beyond our capacity. Everything is a possibility. You know, we are often told that Democrats and Republicans cannot work together. But over the past two years, we proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together. Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe. You came together to pass one in a gen- one-in-a-generation once-in-a-generation infrastructure law building bridges connecting our nation and our people. We came together to pass one the most significant law ever helping victims exposed to toxic burn pits. And, in fact it is important. And, in fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming President, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we cannot work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well. I think folks, you all are just as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message: Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere. That is always been my vision of our country, and I know it is many of yours: to restore the soul of this nation; to rebuild the backbone of America, America's middle class; and to unite the country. We have been sent here to finish the job, in my view. For decades, the middle class has been hollowed out in more than and not in one administration, but for a long time. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be. And along the way, something else we lost: pride, our sense of self-worth. I ran for President to fundamentally change things. To make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel that pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. I know a lot of you always kid me for always quoting my dad. But my dad used to say, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. He really would say this. It is about a lot more than a paycheck. It is about your dignity. It is about respect. It is about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it is going to be okay' and mean it. Well, folks, so let us look at the results. We are not finished yet, by any stretch of the imagination. But unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent -- a 50-year low. And near record and near record unemployment near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We have already created, with your help, 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs the fastest growth in 40 years. And where is it written where is it written that America cannot lead the world in manufacturing? And I do not know where that is written. For too many decades, we imported projects and exported jobs. Now, thanks to what you have all done, we are exporting American products and creating American jobs. Folks, inflation inflation has been a global problem because the pandemic dirup- disrupted our supply chains, and Putin's unfair and brutal war in Ukraine disrupted ener- energy supplied as well as food supplies, blocking all that grain in Ukraine. But we are better positioned than any country on Earth right now. But we have more to do. But here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 from their peak. Food inflation is coming down not fast enough, but coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months, while take-home pay has gone up. Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start new businesses. Ten million. And, by the way, every time every time someone starts a small business, it is an act of hope. And, Madam Vice President, I want to thank you for leading that effort to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the historic laws we enacted that are going to just come into being. Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibilities. Semiconductors small computer chips the size of a fingerprint that power everything from cellphones to automobiles and so much more. These chips were invented in America. Let us get that straight: They were invented in America. And we used to make 40 percent of the world's chips. In the last several decades, we lost our edge. We are down to only producing 10 percent. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas. Today's automobiles need 3,000 chips each of those automobiles but American automobiles could not make enough cars because there were not enough chips. Car prices went up. People got laid off. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones. We can never let that happen again. That is why that is why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. Folks, I know I have been criticized for saying this, but I am not changing my view. We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America the supply chain begins in America. And we have already created we have already created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs without this law, before the law kicks in. With this new law, we are going to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country. And I mean all across the country, throughout not just the coast, but through the middle of the country as well. That is going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing over the next few years. Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres literally a field of dreams. It is going to create 10,000 jobs, that one investment; 7,000 construction jobs; 3,000 jobs in those factories once they are finished. They call them factors. Jobs paying an average of $130,000 a year, and many do not require a college degree. Jobs because we worked together, these jobs where people do not have to leave home to search for opportunity. And it is just getting started. Think about the new homes, the small businesses, the big the medium-sized businesses. So much more that is going to be needed to support those three thou- those 3,000 permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built. Talk to mayors and governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they will tell you what this means for their communities. We are seeing these fields of dreams transform the Heartland. But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world. And, folks, as you all know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We have sunk to 13th in the world. The United States of America 13th in the world in infrastructure, modern infrastructure. But now we are coming back because we came together and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. Folks, already we have funded over 20,000 projects, including major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland projects that are going to put thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, our bridges, our railroads, our tunnels, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed Internet all across America urban, rural, Tribal. And, folks, we are just getting started. We are just getting started. And I mean this sincerely: I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law. And my Republican friends who voted against it as well but I am still I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but do not worry. I promised I'd be a President for all Americans. We will fund these projects. And I will see you at the groundbreaking. Look, this law this law will further unite all of America. Projects like the Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs. One of the nation's most congested freight routes, carrying $2 billion worth of freight every single day across the Ohio River. And, folks, we have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we are really finally going to get it done. I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans in from both states to deliver a commitment of $1.6 billion for this project. And while I was there, I met a young woman named Saria, who is here tonight. I do not know where Saria is. Is she up in the box? I do not know. Saria, how are you? Well, Saria for 30 years for 30 years I learned she told me she'd been a proud member of the Iron workers Local 44, known as known as the Cowboys in the Sky the folks who built who built Cincinnati's skyline. Saria said she cannot wait to be 10 stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. God bless her. That is pride. And that is what we are also building we are building back pride. Look, we are also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes in America, 400,000 schools and childcare centers so every child in America every child in American can drink the water, instead of having permanent damage to their brain. Look, we are making sure we are making sure that every community every community in America has access to affordable, high-speed Internet. No parent should have to drive by a McDonald's parking lot to help their do their homework online with their kids, which many thousands were doing across the country. And when we do these projects and, again, I get criticized about this, but I make no excuses for it we are going to buy American. We are going to buy American. Folks and it is totally it is totally consistent with international trade rules. Buy American has been the law since 1933. But for too long, past administrations Democrat and Republican have fought to get around it. Not anymore. Tonight, I am also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infra- infrastructure projects to be made in America. Made in America. I mean it. Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber-optic cable. And on my watch, American roads, bridges, and American highways are going to be made with American products as well. Folks, my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. So many of you listening tonight, I know you feel it. So many of you felt like you have just simply been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind and treated like they are invisible. Maybe that is you, watching from home. You remember the jobs that went away. You remember them, do not you? The folks at home remember them. You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away. Well, that is why I get that. That is why we are building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of choices we made in the last several years. You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home. For example, too many of you lay in bed at night, like my dad did, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God's name happens if yo- if your spouse gets cancer or your child gets deadly ill or if something happens to you. What are you going are you going to have the money to pay for those medical bills? Are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it? I get it. I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we are taking on powerful interests to bring healthcare costs down so you can sleep better at night with more security. You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Let me say it again: We pay more for prescription drugs than any major nation on Earth. For example, 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. Many of you in this chamber do and in the audience. But every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can literally stay alive. Insulin has been around for over 100 years. The guy who invented it did not even patent it because he wanted it to be available for everyone. It costs the drug companies roughly $10 a vial to make that insulin. Package it and all, you may get up to $13. But Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars $4- to $500 a month making rec- record profits. Not anymore. Not anymore. So so many things that we did are only now coming to fruition. We said we were doing this and we said we'd pass the law to do it, but people did not know because the law did not take effect until January 1 of this year. We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. But people are just finding out. I am sure you are getting the same calls I am getting. Look, there are millions of other Americans who do not are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type 1 diabetes who need these insulin need this insulin to stay alive. Let us finish the job this time. Let us cap the cost of insulin for everybody at $35. Folks and Big Pharma is still going to do very well, I promise you all. I promise you they are going to do very well. This law also this law also caps and it will not even go into effect until 2025. It costs out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year. You do not have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter how much your drug costs are. Because you know why? You all know it. Many of you, like many of my family, have cancer. You know the drugs can range from $10-, $11-, $14-, $15,000 for the cancer drugs. And if drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies are going to have to pay Medicare back the difference. And we are finally we are finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down bringing down prescription drug costs does not just save seniors money, it cuts the federal deficit by billions of dollars by hundreds of billions of dollars because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by Medicare to make keep their commitment to the seniors. Well, guess what? Instead of paying 4- or 500 bucks a month, you are paying 15. That is a lot of savings for the federal government. And, by the way, why would not we want that? Now, some members here are threatening and I know it is not an official party position, so I am not going to exaggerate but threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. As my coach that is okay. That is fair. As my football coach used to say, Lots of luck in your senior year. Make no mistake, if you try anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it. And, look, I am pleased to say that more Americans health have health insurance now than ever in history. A record 16 million people are enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. And thanks thanks to the law I signed last year, saving millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums. And, by the way, that law was written and the benefit expires in 2025. So, my plea to some of you, at least in this audience: Let us finish the job and make those savings permanent. Expand coverage on Medicaid. Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change ever. Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, leading the world to a clean energy future. I visited the devastating aftermath of record floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires from Arizona to New Mexico to all the way up to the Canadian border. More timber has been burned that I have observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri. And we do not have global warming? Not a problem. In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term. New electric grids that are able to weather major storms and not prevent those fire forest fires. Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood. Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities often left behind. We are going to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers. And we are helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits to purchase of electric vehicles and efficient and efficient appliances energy-efficient appliances. Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our land. Let us face reality. The climate crisis does not care if you are in a red or a blue state. It is an existential threat. We have an obligation not to ourselves, but to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I am proud of how the how America, at last, is stepping up to the challenge. We are still going to need oil and gas for a while, but guess what no, we do but there is so much more to do. We got to finish the job. And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Just begin. Look, I am a capitalist. I am a capitalist. But pay your fair share. I think a lot of you at home a lot of you at home agree with me and many people that you know: The tax system is not fair. It is not fair. Look, the idea that in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America, the Fortune 500, made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal taxes? Zero. Folks, it is simply not fair. But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. God love them. Fifteen percent. That is less than a nurse pays. Let me be crystal clear. I said at the very beginning: Under my plans, as long as I am President, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in taxes. Nobody. Not one penny. But let us finish the job. There is more to do. We have to reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax. You know, there is a thousand billionaires in America it is up from about 600 at the beginning of my term but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter. No, I mean it. Think about it. I mean, look, I know you all are not enthusiastic about that, but think about it. Think about it. Have you noticed Big Oil just reported its profits. Record profits. Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis. I think it is outrageous. Why? They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production. And when I talked to a couple of them, they say, We were afraid you were going to shut down all the oil wells and all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them? I said, We are going to need oil for at least another decade, and that is going to exceed and beyond that. We are going to need it. Production. If they had, in fact, invested in the production to keep gas prices down instead they used the record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders. Corporations ought to do the right thing. That is why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long- long-term investments. They will still make considerable profit. Let us finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes. Instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers, I just signed a law to reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That is being fiscally responsible. In the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion -- the largest deficit reduction in American history. Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no President added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor. Nearly 25 percent of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone the last one. They are the facts. Check it out. Check it out. How did Congress respond to that debt? They did the right thing. They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis. They paid the American bill to prevent an economic disaster of the country. So, tonight I am asking the Congress to follow suit. Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned. So my many of some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage I get it unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I am not saying it is a majority Anybody who doubts it, contact my office. I will give you a copy. I will give you a copy of the proposal. That means Congress does not vote Well, I am glad to see no, I tell you, I enjoy conversion. You know, it means if Congress does not keep the programs the way they are, they'd go away. Other Republicans say I am not saying it is a majority of you. I do not even think it is a significant but it is being proposed by individuals. I am not politely not naming them, but it is being proposed by some of you. Look, folks, the idea is that we are not going to be we are not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we do not respond. Folks so, folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the off the books now, right? They are not to be touched? All right. All right. We got unanimity! Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors. Americans have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they have started. So, tonight, let us all agree and we apparently are let us stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare. Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned it. And if anyone tries to cut Social Security which apparently no one is going to do and if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them. I will veto it. And, look, I am not going to allow them to take away be taken away. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. But apparently, it is not going to be a problem. Next month, when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to lay down their plan as well. I really mean it. Let us sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together. Let us do that. I can tell you, the plan I am going to show you is going to cut the deficit by another $2 trillion. And it will not cut a single bit of Medicare or Social Security. In fact, we are going to extend the Medicare Trust Fund at least two decades, because that is going to be the next argument: how do we make keep it solvent. Right? Well, I will not raise taxes on anyone making under 400 grand. But we will pay for it the way we talked about tonight: by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. Look look, look, here is here is the deal. They are not just taking advantage of the tax code, they are taking advantage of you, the American consumer. Here is my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We are already preventing Americans who are receiving surprise medical bills, stopping 1 billion dollar surprise bills per month so far. We are protecting seniors' life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs that are not needed. Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get a hearing aid over the counter without a prescription. Look, capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is extortion. It is exploitation. Last year, I cracked down, with the help of many of you, on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for every good coming into the country. I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90 percent, helping American farmers, businessmen, and consumers. Let us finish the job. Pass the bipartisan legislation to strengthen and to strengthen antitrust enforcement and forbeg- and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage. My administration is also taking on junk fees, those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more. For example, we are making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront, refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed. We have reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts by saving consumers more than $1 billion a year. We are cutting credit card late fees by 75 percent, from $30 to $8. Look, junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one I grew up in, like many of you did. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip. I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore. We have written a bill to stop it all. It is called the Junk Fee Prevention Act. We are going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill. Those fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that are not even resorts. We the idea that cable, Internet, and cellphone companies can charge you $200 or more if you decide to switch to another provider. Give me a break. We can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all the fees upfront. And we will prohibit airlines from charging $50 roundtrip for a family just to be able to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough. Airlines cannot treat your child like a piece of baggage. Americans are tired of being we are tired of being played for suckers. So pass pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off. For too long, workers have been getting stiffed, but not anymore. We are going to be we are beginning to restore the dignity of work. For example, I I should have known this, but I did not until two years ago: Thirty million workers have to sign non-compete agreements for the jobs they take. Thirty million. So a cashier at a burger place cannot walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more. It just changed. Well, they just changed it because we exposed it. That was part of the deal, guys. Look it up. But not anymore. We are banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they are worth. And I must tell you, this is bound to get a response from my friends on my left, with the right. I am so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing. Pass the PRO Act! Because businesses have a right workers have a right to form a union. And let us guarantee all workers have a living wage. Let us make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, affordable childcare. That is going to enable millions of more people to go and stay at work. And let us restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to the lowest level in history. And, by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity, we increase economic growth. So let us finish the job and get more families access to affordable, quality housing. Let us get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. Let us give more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones. Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God's work. These plans are fully paid for, and we can afford to do them. Restoring the dignity of work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. You know, when we made public education 12 years of it universal in the last century, we made the best-educated, best-paid we became the best-education, best-paid nation in the world. But the rest of the world has caught up. It has caught up. Jill, my wife, who teaches full-time, has an expression. I hope I get it right, kid. Any nation that out-educates is going to out-compete us. Any nation that out-educates is going to out-compete us. Folks, we all know 12 years of education is not enough to win the economic competition of the 21st century. If we want to have the best-educated workforce, let us finish the job by providing access to preschool for three and four years old. Studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background they came from. Let us give public school teachers a raise. We are making progress by reducing student debt, increasing Pell Grants for working and middle-class families. Let us finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in high school, provide access to two years of community college the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree. Let us offer every American a path to a good career, whether they go to college or not. And, folks folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis, when schools were closed and we were shutting down everything, let us recognize how far we came in the fight against the pandemic itself. While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people and the ingenuity of medicine, we have broken the COVID grip on us. COVID deaths are down by 90 percent. We have saved millions of lives and opened up our country we opened our country back up. And soon, we will end the public health emergency. But that is called a public health emergency. But we will remember the toll and pain that is never going to go away. More than a million Americans lost their lives to COVID. A million. Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table constantly reminding you that she used to sit there. Remembering them, we remain vigilant. We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe. And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, we are also got to double down prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat. Before I came to office, you remember, during that campaign, the big issue was about inspector generals who would protect taxpayers' dollars, who were sidelined. They were fired. Many people said, We do not need them. And fraud became rampant. Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then since then, we have recovered billions of taxpayers' dollars. Now let us triple the anti-fraud strike force going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars billions of dollars from the American people. And the data shows that for every dollar we put into fighting fraud, the taxpayer will get back at least 10 times as much. It matters. It matters. Look, COVID left its scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020 the first year of the pandemic. We have an obligation to make sure all people are safe. Public safety depends on public trust, as all of us know. But too often, that trust is violated. Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nicholswelcome who had to bury Tyre last week. As many of you personally know, there is no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child. But imagine imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law. Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter came home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving a car. Most of us in here have never had to have the talk the talk that brown and Black parents have had to have with their children. Beau, Hunter, Ashley my children I never had to have the talk with them. I never had to tell them, If a police officer pulls you over, turn your interior lights on right away. Do not reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car. Here is what Tyre's mother shared with me when I spoke to her, when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out. With the faith of God, she said her son was, quote, a beautiful soul and something good will come of this. Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It is up to us, to all of us. We all want the same thing: neighborhoods free of violence, law enfircement law enforcement who earns the community's trust. Just as every cop, when they pin on that badge in the morning, has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely. Equal protection under the law is a covenant we have with each other in America. We know police officers put their lives on the line every single night and day. And we know we ask them, in many cases, to do too much to be counselors, social workers, psychologists responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and so much more. In one sense, we ask much too much of them. I know most cops and their families are good, decent, honorable people the vast majority. And they risk and they risk their lives every time they put that shield on. But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the real training they need. Hold them to higher standards. Help them to succeed in keeping them safe. We also need more first responders and professionals to address the growing mental health, substance abuse challenges. More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime. More community intervention programs. More investments in housing, education, and job training. All this can help prevent violence in the first place. And when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable. With the support with the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers, banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act. Let us commit ourselves to make the words of Tyler's mom true: Something good must come from this. Something good. And all of us all of us folks, it is difficult, but it is simple: All of us in the cha- in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment. We cannot turn away. Let us do what we know in our hearts that we need to do. Let us come together to finish the job on police reform. Do something. Do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde I met with every one of them Do something about gun violence. Thank God thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades. That includes things like that the majority of responsible gun owners already support: enhanced background checks for 18- to 21 years old, red-flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others. But we know our work is not done. Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero. Brandon put his college dreams on hold to be at his mom's side his mom's side when she was dying from cancer. And Brandon Brandon now works at the dance studio started by his grandparents. And two weeks ago, during the Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio door close, and he saw a man standing there pointing a semi-automatic pistol at him. He thought he was going to die, but he thought about the people inside. In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from the gunman who had already killed 11 people in another dance studio. Eleven. He saved lives. It is time we do the same. Ban assault weapons now! Ban them now! Once and for all. I led the fight to do that in 1994. And in 10 years that ban was law, mass shootings went down. After we let it expire in a Republican administration, mass shootings tripled. Let us finish the job and ban these assault weapons. And let us also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months. We have launched a new border plan last month. Unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97 percent as a consequence of that. But American border problems will not be fixed until Congress acts. If we do not pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border and a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. Here in the People's House, it is our duty to protect all the people's rights and freedoms. Congress must restore the right and Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right. The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive healthcare and safeguard patient safety. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans. Make no mistake about it: If Congress passes a national ban, I will veto it. But let us also pass let us also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LBG- LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity. Our strength our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let us remember, the world is watching. I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal attack against Ukraine, a murderous assault, evoking images of death and destruction Europe suffered in World War Two. Putin's invasion has been a test for the ages a test for America, a test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free of tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy? For such defense matters to us because it keeps peace and prevents open season on would-be aggressors that threatens our prosperity. One year later, we know the answer. Yes, we would. And we did. We did. And together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO. We built a global coalition. We stood against Putin's aggression. We stood with the Ukrainian people. Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukrainians' Ambassador to the United States. She represents not her just her nation but the courage of her people. Ambassador is our Ambassador is here, united in our we are united in our support of your country. Will you stand so we can all take a look at you? Thank you. Because we are going to stand with you as long as it takes. Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere. Before I came to office, the story was about how the People's Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world. Not anymore. We made clear and I made clear in my personal conversations, which have been many, with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict. But I will make no apologies that we are investing and to make America stronger. Investing in American innovation and industries that will define the future that China intends to be dominating. Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect advanced technologies so they will not be used against us. Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and determine deter aggression. Today, we are in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world. Anyone else in the world. And I am committed I am committed to work with China where we can advance American interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake about it: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did. Look, let us be clear: Winning the competition should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world. But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker. Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger. Name me a world leader who'd change places with Xi Jinping. Name me one. Name me one. America is rallying the world to meet those challenges from climate to global health to food insecurity to terrorism to territorial aggression. Allies are stepping up, spending more, and doing more. Look, the bridges we are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning how wrong they are. It is never, ever been a good bet to bet against America. Never. When I came to office, most assured that bipartisanship assumed was impossible. But I never believed it. That is why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda to the nation as I stood here. We made real progress together. We passed the law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction. We passed the gun safety law, making historic investments in mental health. We launched the ARPA-H drive for breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, and so much more. We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named after the late Iraq War veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year. And I understand something about those burn pits. But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together. Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire. He wrote Jill, my wife, a letter and me as well about his courageous daughter, Courtney. A contagious laugh. His sister's best friend her sister's best friend. He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans and many of you in the audience. Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually death from a fentanyl overdose. She was just 20 years old. Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, There is no worse pain. Yet, their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end the stigma and change laws. He told us he wants to start a journey towards American recovery. Doug, we are with you. Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year. Big Big you got it. So let us launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production and the sale and trafficking. With more drug detection machines, inspection cargo, stop pills and powder at the border. Working with couriers, like FedEx, to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Second, let us do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at their schools. We must finally hold social media companies accountable for experimenting they are doing running children for profit. And it is time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data that companies collect on all of us. Third, let us do more to keep this nation's one fully sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home. Job training, job placement for veterans and their spouses as they come to return to civilian life. Helping veterans to afford their rent, because no one should be homeless in America, especially someone who served the country. Denis McDoungin Denis McDonough is here, of the VA. We had our first real discussion when I asked him to take the job. I am glad he did. We were losing up to 25 veterans a day on suicide. Now we are losing 17 a day to the silent scourge of suicide. Seventeen veterans a day are committing suicide, more than all the people being killed in the wars. Folks, VA VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screening, proven programs that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they are going through, get them the help they need. We got to do more. And fourth, last year, Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that I was able to start with, and President Obama asked me to lead our administration on this issue. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rates at least by 50 percent in the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases, provide more support for patients and their families. It is personal to so many of us so many of us in this audience. Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama. They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I got married in New York City. Kindred spirits. He wrote us a letter about his little daughter, Ava. And I saw her just before I came over. She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease cancer. After 26 blood transfusions, 11 rounds of radiation, 8 rounds of cheno chemo, 1 kidney removed, given a 5 percent survival rate. He wrote how, in the darkest moments, he thought, If she goes, I cannot stay. Many of you have been through that as well. Jill and I understand that, like so many of you. And he read Jill's book describing our family's cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where we could with Beau. For them, that glimmer of joy was the half-smile of their baby girl. It meant everything to them. They never gave up hope, and little Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month. They just found out Ava is beating the odds and is on her way to being cured of cancer. And she is watching from the White House tonight, if she is not asleep already. For the lives we can save for the lives we can save and the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and prove that we can still do big things. .Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, he undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It is been a huge success. He thought big. He thought large. He moved! I believe we can do the same thing with cancer. Let us end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all. Folks, there is one reason why we have been able to do all of these things: our democracy itself. It is the most fundamental thing of all. With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is. Over the last few years, our democracy has been threatened and attacked, put at risk put to the test in this very room on January the 6th. And then, just a few months ago, an unhinged Big Lie assailant unleashed a political violence at the home of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, using the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on January 6th. Here tonight, in this chamber, is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack but is as tough and as strong and as resilient as they get: my friend, Paul Pelosi. Paul, stand up. But such a heinous act should have never happened. We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. We have to protect the right to vote, not suppress the that fundamental right. Honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We have to uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy. And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor. Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It is an American issue. Every generation of Americans have faced a moment where they have been called to protect our democracy, defend it, stand up for it. And this is our moment. My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point, one of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the direction we now take is going to decide the course of this nation for decades to come. We are not bystanders of history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power of We the People. We are facing the test of our time. We have to be the nation we have always been at our best: optimistic, hopeful, forward-looking. A nation that embraces light over dark, hope over fear, unity over division, stability over chaos. We have to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people. The only nation in the world built on an idea the only one. Other nations are defined by geography, ethnicity, but we are the only nation based on an idea that all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities. So I have come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report on the state of the Union. And here is my my report: Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backboken backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the state of the Union is strong. I am not new to this place. I stand here tonight having served as long as about any one of you who have ever served here. But I have never been more optimistic about our future about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there is nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "abcnewsgocomPoliticsstateunionaddressreadtranscriptstoryid96970217", "title": "Michael Bennet` State of the Union address: Read the transcript", "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-union-address-read-transcript/story?id=96970217", "publication_date": "08-02-2023", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Joe Biden"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 663, "text": "Thank you. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I used to think that I was reasonably astute at public affairs, but I do not have any better sense than to get up here and try to speak behind Mayor Powell, Cathy Bessant, and Jesse Jackson. I do not know how smart I am today. Let me say to all of you, it is wonderful to be here. Madam Mayor, thank you for making us feel so welcome and for your sterling leadership. I am delighted to be here with Jackie, your hero and my friend who is all of our heroes. Thank you. Thank you, Dave Bernauer, for this wonderful Walgreens store. I am going to go in and shop in a minute-add to the local community. Thank you, Mel Farr, for bringing jobs and opportunities and cars, even in 2 months' installments, to every community in this country. Thank you. Thank you, Reverend Jackson, for believing that we could keep hope alive in every city and rural area in this country and it could be good business to do so. I want to thank some others who are with us here today : Joe Stroud of Jovon Broadcasting; my good friend Al From, the Democratic Leadership Council; David Wilhelm, the former Chairman of the Democratic Party from Illinois, who is here with me today. I want to thank Senator Durbin and Congressman Costello, two of the ablest, finest people in the United States Congress. I want to tell you that they are joined here today by other Members of Congress, including Congressman Jim Clyburn, who came all the way from South Carolina; Congressman Paul Kanjorski from the State of Pennsylvania; and Congressman Dale Kildee from Michigan all of whom care about this community and communities like it all across America. I thank them. And I want to thank your neighboring mayor, Clarence Harmon, for coming over from St. Louis, and your former mayor, Gordon Bush, for being here with me. And I want to thank Secretary Cuomo, Secretary Glickman, Secretary Slater, and all the other people from the administration. We have had a great time these last 2 days, going across America. We are going to finish this day, first by shopping at Walgreens, and then we are going to get on an airplane and fly to South Dakota, where we will begin tomorrow at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. So from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to East St. Louis to Pine Ridge, it has been a wonderful trip. But let me ask you something. If you look around this crowd today, I have to make-this is a happy day, a happy day. But I want to say one serious thing off of this subject today, because of a remark that was made earlier by Cathy, that I believe in community development-emphasis, community. You have been very good to me, to the First Lady, to Vice President Gore, and Mrs. Gore. You have supported our initiatives and especially the Vice President's leadership of all of our community development. But what is the first thing that makes it work? Look around this crowd today. We have people from all kinds of backgrounds, all different colors, all different religions. Everybody-all different ages, working for something good. So this is the first chance, my first stop in Illinois since the tragic string of shootings in Illinois and Indiana these last couple of days, that have come to end with the apparent suicide of the alleged gunman. Now, I do not want to say a lot, but I think it is important to note that while we have to wait for all of the details to come in, the early reports indicated that this shooting spree against Jews, Orthodox Jews, against the young Asian students, taking the life of a former basketball coach at Northwestern, an African-American, all were motivated by some blind racial hatred against anybody who did not happen to be white. Is not it ironic that this occurred during the time we celebrated the birth of our Nation on the Fourth of July? That action was a rebuke to the very ideals that got us started. They are also a stern reminder to us that even as we celebrate this, even as we stand up against racial and ethnic and religious hatred in Kosovo, in Northern Ireland, and the Middle East and Africa, we have still got work to do here at home. So I say to you, I want to get back to the celebrating, but I issue an appeal here from East St. Louis to every community and every citizen in this country: We must search the hearts of our citizens and search the strength of our communities, that Congress should pass the hate crimes legislation, but we should rid our hearts of hatred immediately. Now, I want to tell you what got us going on this. In 1992, when I ran for ENTITY, I came to East St. Louis, and I said I wanted to create a country in the 21st century where there was opportunity for every citizen, responsibility from every citizen, and a community of all American citizens. I said that we ought to have a new role for Government, that Government could not solve all the problems, but walking away from them did not work very well, either; and that we had to focus on creating the conditions and giving people the tools to make the most of their own lives and to get together across lines that had divided them for too long. Goodness knows, in the inner cities and the rural areas of our country, lines have divided those who worked hard but had no money and those who had plenty of money but did not believe it could be very well spent in the inner city or in rural areas. Now, if you look at what happened since, we see in this community both poverty and great promise: retail returning, new jobs, new residents, new hope, Walgreens putting up 400 stores across America, many of them in innercity areas. But still, there are many unmet needs and unmet opportunities. You heard what Cathy said about opportunities. Let me tell you, the economists talk about something in our inner cities called the purchasing power gap. Let me tell you what that means. That means most people in East St. Louis, even though the unemployment rate is higher than the national average, most people get up and go to work every day. And if you take the money that you earn here as against the money you are able to spend here because of the jobs that are here and the stores that are here, in America as a whole, there is 25 percent more money earned than spent in the inner cities. In Los Angeles, it is 35 percent; in East St. Louis, it is 40 percent. So you can handle this Walgreens and a lot more besides, and we want to see them coming here. And we thank Bank of America for the library, and we thank those involved in the hotel, the bank, the homes being built near here. We also want you to know that we want to do our part. Secretary Cuomo's housing and urban development block grants, along with Bank of America and many department stores, are helping Jackie build the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Center near here. So this is what Vice President Gore and I have tried to do with our empowerment zones and our community banks and our vigorous enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act. It says you are supposed to loan money everywhere in America. That law has been on the books for 22 years, but over 95 percent of the money loaned under it, billions of dollars, has been loaned since the Clinton-Gore administration has been in office, and I am proud of that. We made East St. Louis an enterprise community in our first round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities way back in 1994, and because you have done so well, East St. Louis is designated as an empowerment zone for our second round, which means more money being spent here by the Government, more tax incentives for the private sector to put businesses here and to hire the people from East St. Louis and give them good jobs. Senator Durbin, Congressman Costello, and every Member of the Congress here is committed to creating that second round of empowerment zones and funding them this year. We need help from Republicans and Democrats alike. This is not a party issue. All Americans benefit when all Americans work. Now, let me tell you why else we came here today. We want to make two points which all the previous speakers have made. I just want to be very explicit. Starting with what the mayor said about location, location, location, accessibility-boy, that was a good rap, was not it? I like that. That was good. The first point we want to make is, when the Walgreens' president comes, or when an executive from Bank of America comes, or when Mel Farr comes, and comes to places like this or the Mississippi Delta or Appalachia, the other places we are going, is, hey, there are business opportunities out here. If you have got people who want to go to work and people with money to spend, and they are both in the same place, it is a good place to invest. The second thing we are doing is promoting what you have heard referred to as the new markets initiative. Now, let me just tell you what that is. That is a bill we are going to put before the Congress that says that, if people invest in any high unemployment, high poverty area anywhere in America, inside or outside one of our empowerment communities, they can get a tax credit for the money they put up, and they can go to the bank and borrow money and have it guaranteed, a guaranteed loan by the Federal Government, which will lower the interest rates, which will mean it will be much cheaper for people to invest in communities like East St. Louis than it otherwise would be. Now, the Government is not going to do it, nobody is going to put any money here if they think they are going to lose it. If you put up $100 and you invest it and I give you a 25 percent tax credit, if it is a bad investment, you still lose $75. But it makes it more likely that people will do it. It makes it more likely that they will take a look. It makes it more likely that you will build the kind of relationships which will make people know you and trust you and want to build a common future with you. And that is what we are trying to do. It is not a handout, but it is darn sure a hand up, and you are entitled to it. And let me say to all of you, it is something that is good for the rest of America. We have had almost 19 million new jobs; the longest peacetime expansion in history; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates ever recorded in this country to date. But the unemployment rates are still higher than they are for the rest of the country. Incomes are rising, but they are still lower than they are for the rest of the country. There is room to grow, room to learn. Look, we are all going to have to work hard at this. Nobody's got all the answers. There is no magic wand. But we know one thing: People make these investments one at a time, just like Mel Farr sells his cars one at a time. You can only build one Walgreens on this spot, and somebody had to come up with the money. Somebody had to make the decision. Somebody's got to hire all the people that work here. Somebody's got to train them. Somebody's got to make all these decisions. But what we can do is to create an environment in which more people will want to hold hands with you and walk into the 21st century, so that nobody is left behind, and we all go forward together. You know, in 1960, Look magazine said East St. Louis was an all-American city. It was because of stockyards and shipping yards. It was because of private enterprise. The Government can help, but private enterprise will make East St. Louis that all-American city again, if we go forward together. And I just want to make one last point to everybody else in America who is looking at this. I spent a lot of time as your President, now, trying to figure out, how can I keep this economic good time going? When we started, nobody believed we could have an economic expansion that would go on this long. When we started, no conventional economist believed you could have unemployment rates under 4 1/2 percent nationwide without having inflation and high interest rates which would wreck everything. When we started, no one thought so. But, you know, all of these young, technological geniuses are figuring out all this new computer technology, and it is rifling through what we all do, and it is making us more productive. And we are doing a good job. But now I say to myself every day when I get up, now, what can I do to keep this going? The only way to keep it going-more growth with no inflation; more jobs and higher wages without bringing it to a halt-is to have new people working and new people buying, new people producing. Where are those people? Those are the people you move from welfare to work. Those are the people who are disabled, and we are going to let them keep their health insurance when they go into the workplace, so they can move into the workplace. And most important of all, those are the people in the inner cities and the rural areas, on the Native American reservations that have been passed by, by this recovery. America has been blessed by this economic recovery. Now we are determined to see that all Americans are blessed by it as we move into the 21st century. Thank you, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunityeaststlouisillinois", "title": "Remarks to the Community in East St. Louis, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-community-east-st-louis-illinois", "publication_date": "06-07-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 695, "text": "My fellow Americans : I am happy to have this opportunity to talk to you once more before I leave the White House. Next Tuesday, General Eisenhower will be inaugurated as ENTITY . A short time after the new President takes his oath of office, I will be on the train going back home to Independence, Missouri. I will once again be a plain, private citizen of this great Republic. That is as it should be. Inauguration Day will be a great demonstration of our democratic process. I am glad to be a part of it-glad to wish General Eisenhower all possible success, as he begins his term--glad the whole world will have a chance to see how simply and how peacefully our American system transfers the vast power of the Presidency from my hands to his. It is a good object lesson in democracy. I am very proud of it. And I know you are, too. During the last 2 months I have done my best to make this transfer an orderly one. I have talked with my successor on the affairs of the country, both foreign and domestic, and my Cabinet officers have talked with their successors. I want to say that General Eisenhower and his associates have cooperated fully in this effort. Such an orderly transfer from one party to another has never taken place before in our history. I think a real precedent has been set. In speaking to you tonight, I have no new revelations to make--no political statements-no policy announcements. There are simply a few things in my heart that I want to say to you. I want to say goodby and thanks for your help. and I want to talk to you a little while about what has happened since I became your ENTITY. I am speaking to you from the room where I have worked since April 12, 1945. This is the ENTITY's office in the West Wing of the White House. This is the desk where I have signed most of the papers that embodied the decisions I have made as ENTITY. It has been the desk of many Presidents, and will be the desk of many more. Since I became ENTITY, I have been to Europe, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands--Wake Island and Hawaii. I have visited almost every State in the Union. I have traveled 135,000 miles by air, 77,000 by rail, and 17,000 by ship. But the mail always followed me, and wherever I happened to be, that is where the office of the ENTITY was. The greatest part of the ENTITY's job is to make decisions--big ones and small ones, dozens of them almost every day. The papers may circulate around the Government for a while but they finally reach this desk. And then, there is no place else for them to go. The ENTITY--whoever he is--has to decide. He cannot pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That is his job. That is what I have been doing here in this room, for almost 8 years. And over in the main part of the White House, there is a study on the second floor--a room much like this one--where I have worked at night and early in the morning on the papers I could not get to at the office. Of course, for more than 3 years Mrs. Truman and I were not living in the White House. We were across the street in the Blair House. That was when the White House almost fell down on us and had to be rebuilt. I had a study over at the Blair House, too, but living in the Blair House was not as convenient as living in the White House. The Secret Service would not let me walk across the street, so I had to get in a car every morning to cross the street to the White House office, again at noon to go to the Blair House for lunch, again to go back to the office after lunch, and finally take an automobile at night to return to the Blair House. Fantastic, is not it? But necessary, so my guards thought--and they are the bosses on such matters as that. Now, of course, we are back in the White House. It is in very good condition, and General Eisenhower will be able to take up his residence in the house and work right here. That will be much more convenient for him, and I am very glad the renovation job was all completed before his term began. Your new ENTITY is taking office in quite different circumstances than when I became ENTITY 8 years ago. On April 1945, I had been presiding over the Senate in my capacity as Vice President. When the Senate recessed about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I walked over to the office of the Speaker of the House, Mr. Rayburn, to discuss pending legislation. As soon as I arrived, I was told that Mr. Early, one of President Roosevelt's secretaries, wanted me to call. I reached Mr. Early, and he told me to come to the White House as quickly as possible, to enter by way of the Pennsylvania Avenue entrance, and to come to Mrs. Roosevelt's study. When I arrived, Mrs. Roosevelt told me the tragic news, and I felt the shock that all of you felt a little later--when the word came over the radio and appeared in the newspapers. President Roosevelt had died. I offered to do anything I could for Mrs. Roosevelt, and then I asked the Secretary of State to call the Cabinet together. At 7:09 p.m. I was sworn in as ENTITY by Chief Justice Stone in the Cabinet Room.Things were happening fast in those days. The San Francisco conference to organize the United Nations had been called for April 25th. I was asked if that meeting would go forward. I announced that it would. That was my first decision. After attending President Roosevelt's funeral, I went to the Hall of the House of Representatives and told a joint session of the Congress that I would carry on President Roosevelt's policies. On May 7th, Germany surrendered. The announcement was made on May 8th, my 61st birthday. Mr. Churchill called me shortly after that and wanted a meeting with me and Prime Minister Stalin of Russia. Later on, a meeting was agreed upon, and Churchill, Stalin, and I met at Potsdam in Germany. Meanwhile, the first atomic explosion took place out in the New Mexico desert. The war against Japan was still going on. I made the decision that the atomic bomb had to be used to end it. I made that decision in the conviction it would save hundreds of thousands of lives--Japanese as well as American. Japan surrendered, and we were faced with the huge problems of bringing the troops home and reconverting the economy from war to peace. All these things happened within just a little over 4 months--from April to August 1945. I tell you this to illustrate the tremendous scope of the work your ENTITY has to do. And all these emergencies and all the developments to meet them have required the ENTITY to put in long hours--usually 17 hours a day, with no payment for overtime. I sign my name, on the average, 600 times a day, see and talk to hundreds of people every month, shake hands with thousands every year, and still carry on the business of the largest going concern in the whole world. There is no job like it on the face of the earth--in the power which is concentrated here at this desk, and in the responsibility and difficulty of the decisions. I want all of you to realize how big a job, how hard a job, it is--not for my sake, because I am stepping out of it--but for the sake of my successor. He needs the understanding and the help of every citizen. It is not enough for you to come out once every 4 years and vote for a candidate, and then go back home and say, Well, I have done my part, now let the new President do the worrying. He cannot do the job alone. Regardless of your politics, whether you are Republican or Democrat, your fate is tied up with what is done here in this room. The ENTITY is ENTITY of the whole country. We must give him our support as citizens of the United States. He will have mine, and I want you to give him yours. I suppose that history will remember my term in office as the years when the cold war began to overshadow our lives. I have had hardly a day in office that has not been dominated by this all-embracing struggle-this conflict between those who love freedom and those who would lead the world back into slavery and darkness. And always in the background there has been the atomic bomb. But when history says that my term of office saw the beginning of the cold war, it will also say that in those 8 years we have set the course that can win it. We have succeeded in carving out a new set of policies to attain peace--positive policies, policies of world leadership, policies that express faith in other free people. We have averted world war III up to now, and we may already have succeeded in establishing conditions which can keep that war from happening as far ahead as man can see. These are great and historic achievements that we can all be proud of. Think of the difference between our course now and our course 30 years ago. After the First World War we withdrew from world affairs--we failed to act in concert with other peoples against aggression--we helped to kill the League of Nations--and we built up tariff barriers that strangled world trade. This time, we avoided those mistakes. We helped to found and sustain the United Nations. We have welded alliances that include the greater part of the free world. And we have gone ahead with other free countries to help build their economies and link us all together in a healthy world trade. Think back for a moment to the 1930's and you will see the difference. The Japanese moved into Manchuria, and free men did not act. The Fascists moved into Ethiopia, and we did not act. The Nazis marched into the Rhineland, into Austria, into Czechoslovakia, and free men were paralyzed for lack of strength and unity and will. Think about those years of weakness and indecision, and the World War II which was their evil result. Then think about the speed and courage and decisiveness with which we have moved against the Communist threat since World War II. The first crisis came in 1945 and 1946, when the Soviet Union refused to honor its agreement to remove its troops from Iran. Members of my Cabinet came to me and asked if we were ready to take the risk that a firm stand involved. I replied that we were. So we took our stand--we made it clear to the Soviet Union that we expected them to honor their agreement--and the Soviet troops were withdrawn from Iran. Then, in early 1947, the Soviet Union threatened Greece and Turkey. The British sent me a message saying they could no longer keep their forces in that area. Something had to be done at once, or the eastern Mediterranean would be taken over by the Communists. On March 12th, I went before the Congress and stated our determination to help the people of Greece and Turkey maintain their independence. Today, Greece is still free and independent; and Turkey is a bulwark of strength at a strategic corner of the world. Then came the Marshall plan which saved Europe, the heroic Berlin airlift, and our military aid programs. We inaugurated the North Atlantic Pact, the Rio Pact binding the Western Hemisphere together, and the defense pacts with countries of the Far Pacific.Most important of all, we acted in Korea. I was in Independence, Missouri, in June 1950, when Secretary Acheson telephoned me and gave me the news about the invasion of Korea. I told the Secretary to lay the matter at once before the United Nations, and I came on back to Washington. Flying back over the flatlands of the Middle West and over the Appalachians that summer afternoon, I had a lot of time to think. I turned the problem over in my mind in many ways, but my thoughts kept coming back to the 1930's--to Manchuria, to Ethiopia, the Rhineland, Austria, and finally to Munich. Here was history repeating itself. Here was another probing action, another testing action. If we let the Republic of Korea go under, some other country would be next, and then another. And all the time, the courage and confidence of the free world would be ebbing away, just as it did in the 1930's. And the United Nations would go the way of the League of Nations. When I reached Washington, I met immediately with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and General Bradley, and the other civilian and military officials who had information and advice to help me decide on what to do. We talked about the problems long and hard. We considered those problems very carefully. It was not easy to make the decision to send American boys again into battle. I was a soldier in the First World War, and I know what a soldier goes through. I know well the anguish that mothers and fathers and families go through. So I knew what was ahead if we acted in Korea. But after all this was said, we realized that the issue was whether there would be fighting in a limited area now or on a much larger scale later on--whether there would be some casualties now or many more casualties later.So a decision was reached--the decision I believe was the most important in my time as ENTITY. In the days that followed, the most heartening fact was that the American people clearly agreed with the decision. And in Korea, our men are fighting as valiantly as Americans have ever fought-because they know they are fighting in the same cause of freedom in which Americans have stood ever since the beginning of the Republic. Where free men had failed the test before, this time we met the test. We met it firmly. We met it successfully. The aggression has been repelled. The Communists have seen their hopes of easy conquest go down the drain. The determination of free people to defend themselves has been made clear to the Kremlin. As I have thought about our worldwide struggle with the Communists these past 8 years--day in and day out--I have never once doubted that you, the people of our country, have the will to do what is necessary to win this terrible fight against communism. I know the people of this country have that will and determination, and I have always depended on it. Because I have been sure of that, I have been able to make necessary decisions even though they called for sacrifices by all of us. And I have not been wrong in my judgment of the American people. That same assurance of our people's determination will be General Eisenhower's greatest source of strength in carrying on this struggle. Now, once in a while, I get a letter from some impatient person asking, why do not we get it over with? Why do not we issue an ultimatum, make all-out war, drop the atomic bomb? For most Americans, the answer is quite simple: We are not made that way. We are a moral people. Peace is our goal, with justice and freedom. We cannot, of our own free will, violate the very principles that we are striving to defend. The whole purpose of what we are doing is to prevent world war III. Starting a war is no way to make peace. But if anyone still thinks that just this once, bad means can bring good ends, then let me remind you of this: We are living in the 8th year of the atomic age. We are not the only nation that is learning to unleash the power of the atom. A third world war might dig the grave not only of our Communist opponents but also of our own society, our world as well as theirs. Starting an atomic war is totally unthinkable for rational men. Then, some of you may ask, when and how will the cold war end? I think I can answer that simply. The Communist world has great resources, and it looks strong. But there is a fatal flaw in their society. Theirs is a godless system, a system of slavery; there is no freedom in it, no consent. The Iron Curtain, the secret police, the constant purges, all these are symptoms of a great basic weakness--the rulers' fear of their own people. In the long run the strength of our free society, and our ideals, will prevail over a system that has respect for neither God nor man. Last week, in my State of the Union Message to the Congress--and I hope you will all take the time to read it--I explained how I think we will finally win through. As the free world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain--and as the Soviet hopes for easy expansion are blocked--then there will have to come a time of change in the Soviet world. Nobody can say for sure when that is going to be, or exactly how it will come about, whether by revolution, or trouble in the satellite states, or by a change inside the Kremlin. Whether the Communist rulers shift their policies of their own free will--or whether the change comes about in some other way-I have not a doubt in the world that a change will occur.I have a deep and abiding faith in the destiny of free men. With patience and courage, we shall some day move on into a new era--a wonderful golden age--an age when we can use the peaceful tools that science has forged for us to do away with poverty and human misery everywhere on earth. Think what can be done, once our capital, our skills, our science--most of all atomic energy--can be released from the tasks of defense and turned wholly to peaceful purposes all around the world.There is no end to what can be done. I cannot help but dream out loud just a little here. The Tigris and Euphrates Valley can be made to bloom as it did in the times of Babylon and Nineveh. Israel can be made the country of milk and honey as it was in the time of Joshua. There is a plateau in Ethiopia some 6,000 to 8,000 feet high, that has 65,000 square miles of land just exactly like the corn belt in northern Illinois. Enough food can be raised there to feed a hundred million people. There are places in South America--places in Colombia and Venezuela and Brazil-just like that plateau in Ethiopia--places where food could be raised for millions of people. These things can be done, and they are self-liquidating projects. If we can get peace and safety in the world under the United Nations, the developments will come so fast we will not recognize the world in which we now live. This is our dream of the future--our picture of the world we hope to have when the Communist threat is overcome. I have talked a lot tonight about the menace of communism--and our fight against it-because that is the overriding issue of our time. But there are some other things we have done that history will record. One of them is that we in America have learned how to attain real prosperity for our people. We have 62 1/2 million people at work. Businessmen, farmers, laborers, white-collar people, all have better incomes and more of the good things of life than ever before in the history of the world. There has not been a failure of an insured bank in nearly 9 years. No depositor has lost a cent in that period. And the income of our people has been fairly distributed, perhaps more so than at any other time in recent history. We have made progress in spreading the blessings of American life to all of our people. There has been a tremendous awakening of the American conscience on the great issues of civil rights--equal economic opportunities, equal rights of citizenship, and equal educational opportunities for all our people, whatever their race or religion or status of birth. So, as I empty the drawers of this desk, and as Mrs. Truman and I leave the White House, we have no regret. We feel we have done our best in the public service. I hope and believe we have contributed to the welfare of this Nation and to the peace of the world. When Franklin Roosevelt died, I felt there must be a million men better qualified than I, to take up the Presidential task. But the work was mine to do, and I had to do it. And I have tried to give it everything that was in me. Through all of it, through all the years that I have worked here in this room, I have been well aware I did not really work alone-that you were working with me. No ENTITY could ever hope to lead our country, or to sustain the burdens of this office, save as the people helped with their support. I have had that help--you have given me that support--on all our great essential undertakings to build the free world's strength and keep the peace. Those are the big things. Those are the things we have done together.For that I shall be grateful, always. And now, the time has come for me to say good night--and God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsfarewelladdresstheamericanpeople", "title": "The President's Farewell Address to the American People", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-farewell-address-the-american-people", "publication_date": "15-01-1953", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

{"id": 577, "text": "House Majority Whip Stephen J. Scalise. We appreciate President Trump having us into the Oval Office to talk about health care and the improvements that are being made. The President has worked and said, Bring us your best ideas. And these are members of the Republican Study Committee who have brought those good ideas and worked in a very diligent way to ultimately get to a yes on this bill with the changes that the President has asked us to make that we are going to make in the bill. And with that, I want to lead it off to the Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker. Republican Study Committee Chairman B. Mark Walker. Thank you, Mr. Whip. We are excited about today because it is historic knowing that we are getting a couple of very important things to the steering committee members: work requirements throughout the country, and also something what we call block grants, which allows the States to be empowered. We believe they should be able to hold the reins when it comes to managing their population. We also think this would provide more coverage for the indigent, for those sick, and for those disabled. So we are excited about it today, and that is why we have come today to celebrate the American Health Care Act and moving forward with a yes. The President. I just want to say that these are folks that were either a no or a maybe. And we had a nice meeting, and we have been talking all during the night. This did not just happen over the last 20 minutes. This has been going all night long. And we are doing some incredible things. I want everyone to know, I am a hundred percent behind this. I want everybody to know that the press has not been speaking properly about how great this is going to be. They have not been giving it a fair press. The press is-well, as you know, in many cases, I call it the fake news. It is fake news. This is going to be great for people. I watch-I say, that is not the bill we are passing. And I also want everybody to know that all of these noes, or potential noes, are all yeses. Every single person sitting in this room is now a yes. And we made certain changes, and very, frankly, little-although the block grant is very important, because I want the States to get the money and to run their program, if they want to run it, because they can do it better than the Federal Government. They are better equipped than the Federal Government. I also want people to know that Obamacare is dead; it is a dead health care plan. It is not even a health care plan, frankly. And I watched the architect of the plan-yesterday I watched the old clip where he said the American people are stupid to have voted for it. I watched Bill Clinton saying, this is the craziest thing I have ever seen. And only because everyone knows it is on its last dying feet, the fake news is trying to say good things about it, okay? The fake media. And there is no good news about Obamacare. Obamacare is dead. And unless we gave it massive subsidies in a year from now or 6 months from now, it is not even going to be here. So when they say, Oh, more people on the plan, there is not going to be any people on the plan. I was in Tennessee-I was just telling the folks-and half of the State has no insurance company, and the other half is going to lose the insurance company. The people do not know what to do. It is a disaster. Obamacare is dead. Nothing to do with these people. Nothing to do with me. It is on respirator, and it is just about ready to implode. Now, we could wait for 6 months or a year and let it happen. It is not the right thing to do for the people. This is a great plan. This is going to be fantastic. You are going to have bidding at the one level by insurance companies. And remember this, remember this: Those lines are going to come out. You are going to have bidding by insurance companies like you have never seen before. Plans are going to come out like nobody has ever seen before. Plans that nobody has even thought of now are going to be devised by insurance companies to take care of people. And we are going to take care of people at all levels. So I just want to let the world know: I am 100 percent in favor. These folks-and they are tough, and they love their constituents, and they love this country. These folks were noes. Mostly noes yesterday. And now every single one is a yes. And I just want to thank you. We are going to have a health care plan that is going to be second to none. It is going to be great. And the people will see then. By the way, it will take a little while, because before it all kicks in and welds together. It takes a little while. With Obamacare, it got worse and worse. Premiums went up 116 percent. They went up 58 percent. The Governor of Minnesota said that the Affordable Care Act-Obamacare-is no longer affordable. That is what he said. The Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. And he is a guy that-he is a good Democrat; he wanted Obamacare. He said it is no longer affordable. Obamacare is not an alternative. It is not there. It is dead. It is dead. So I just want to say thank you very much. I really appreciate it. A hundred percent of the noes are yeses. And some of them were strong noes. Some were just noes. And we had a couple that were mixed. But I just want to thank you folks. And we are going to have a great, great health care plan.

{"id": 1059, "text": "Thank you very much. You know, Paul, if you really have all morning been talking about all those things you said, then I have not got anything left to say. That is what I was going to talk about. No, I want to thank you. It is a privilege to be with so many hard-working and dedicated Republicans. And with regard to the interruptions last night, afterwards I said to George, I said, I thought there for awhile I was going to have to do the speech one word at a time. But it is a special honor to greet the women and men who've just become the new Republican National Committee. And incidentally, if we are the reason for all of this, we would not have been in a position to be responsible for all of this if it had not been for people like you putting us here, and we are most grateful. Each of you has dedicated years of effort to the cause that unites us. And today, you take up positions of the highest responsibility in one of the oldest, proudest political parties on Eartha party that is always stood for human freedom, a party that is given the world leaders like Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight David Eisenhower and Abraham Lincoln. Your positions give you an opportunity to serve our country in an historical manner. And on behalf of all Republicans, I give you a heartfelt congratulations. During your time in office you will face many challenges, but none will be greater than the challenge you face in the next 74 days. And I just know that with the people by our side, we willand by we I mean Republicanswe'll lead not only our party but our country. And we will fight this campaign with every ounce of strength we have, and the people will win. Our strategy is simply stated: We will go to the peopleto all the peoplewe'll speak of our beliefs; we will stand on the record; we will deal in the facts. The opposition has already begun to try to pit one group of Americans against another. But the election of '84 will be a battle not of groups, but of ideas. And we will wage it with joy and vigor. We know that our constituency is everyone in this country. Our special interest group is the American people. And our intent is to keep promoting policies that will help all of the people and help the people of this country to help themselves. This year offers us an historic opportunity to get across an historic truth: that we are the party of new ideas; we are the party of the future; and we are the party whose philosophy is vigorous and dynamic. The old stereotype of a kind of pudgy, stolid, unimaginative Republicanthere may be a few cartoonists around that still want to portray us as that, but they are lying in their teeth if they do. This is not going to be a cakewalk. I know that all of you know that. And it is no time to sit on our laurels. 1984 is the year when we can get out there in the union halls and the VFW, the church meetings, and get out the word. As a matter of fact, we will be walking away from here in a few minutes, because Nancy and I are due in Chicago to speak to the VFW this afternoon at their national convention. But we want to get out the word on how, through cutting tax rates, we are making the GOP stand for Great Opportunity Party, and get out the word on how our policies have enhanced America's strength and this has made the peace that we enjoy more solid and durable; get out the word on how inflation has plummeted and unemployment has fallen and the value of the dollar is higher and the economy is expanding. And we did not do this to help some of the people; we did it to help all of the people. Things are going so well that the opposition has had to reverse the meaning of a few words and concepts. Indeed, at their meeting in San Francisco, one of their speakers called the economic expansion-and I quotean illusion. Well, it is pretty hard to cash an illusion. People are cashing bigger checks. But according to the opposition, prosperity is an illusion. Strong defensesand this again is quoting themare destabilizing. And if you read the record of the last administration backward, it has a happy ending. Well, this expansion has already lasted 20 months without fueling inflation. It is given nearly 6 1/2 million more Americans, as I said last night, jobs. There is nothing dangerous about an expansion that is based on hard work and innovation, and the American people know it. Looking to the future, it is clear that the opposition has only one innovation to offerstrange for them, tooa huge tax increase. But that is their usual knee-jerk reaction, and as I said the other day, when their knee jerks, we get kicked. But let us get the word out on that one, too. Our people do not believe, or our party does not believe, that the people are undertaxed. We believe the Federal Government is overfed. To bring the budget under control, we need more Republicans elected who will support the line-item veto and the balanced budget amendment. You have heard me say that before, but we are going to keep on saying it, because every poll indicates that the American people support those measures overwhelmingly, once again showing that the leadership of the other party totally is ignoring what their own people are telling them they want. And to spur new investment, to enable the people to keep a greater share of their earnings, we need that historic simplification of the tax code. And if we can broaden that base, if we can begin to get the unpaid tax that is now out there from those who are freeloading on their neighbors, we can reduce the rates for everyone. Our vision is and must be an America of greater incentives, more growth, and new opportunities. But let me leave you just one last thought from my heart: Holding this office has allowed me to see as never before how richly our nation has been blessed. Around the world, totalitarians tread ideals underfoot and oppress millions. But in America, it is still our privilege to stand for liberty. This election is for more than our party and more than the White House; it is for the future of our beloved country, the place Mr. Lincoln called the last, best hope of man. For the sake of our children and the millions on Earth who look to America for hope, I know that we will fight the good fight, we will keep the faith. There was one thingI know that many of the things I have said here were repeated many times in the convention, because they had to do with the actual record of 'what we have been doing in the management of the Government, but I think you might be pleased to knowyou'll remember back a couple of years ago when we were talking about a private sector initiative, encouraging that. And thousands of volunteers came forth with every kind of idea, and we had a commission, temporarily put together, that collected, and then in the White House we had computerized the literally thousands of programs throughout the country that citizens and community groups have themselves put in place to solve some problems that heretofore our opponents always would think was only for government to do. Well, we still maintain a headquarters in that private initiatives, and there is hardly a week goes by that we do not have something that we pick up the phone to them and say, Hey... And sometimes it is a problem only involving one individual that we have heard about, or that we have read in the press about, with a situation that government is not equipped to solve, and we call them. And you know, a couple of days later a call comes back: All taken care of. And the same thing is true with programs. In Washington one day I turned on the television, and I saw a bunch of fellows out there, and they were painting houses and they were doing all sorts of things and carrying things in and out, and then the TV cameraman was stopping them, and they were being questioned. Well, some were lawyers and some were doctors and some were business people and even some judges, and yet they were painting houses and so forth. And I thought, my gosh, they are doing thatthis must be Texas, this must be that Christmas in April program in a town here in Texas where all year long they collect the information about the elderly, the disabled, the people who cannot afford to fix up their houses, to restore the plumbing, to do the things that need doing. And when they have got all this list complete, then the merchants contribute the paint and the things of that kind, and then the people go out, and Christmas in April is refurbishing all those houses for those people in need. And, by golly, it was Washington, DC, that was doing it, because our private sector initiative had carried the word throughout the country of Christmas in April, and every community, literally, that heard about it said, Hey, that is a good idea, and took it up. And we have not talked much about that; it is not the easiest thing to talk about, I guess. But it is showing that the America that used to have a barn-building bee when a farmer's barn burned, when they used to help the fellow that got injured to harvest his crop and all, that America has always been here. The Government just tried to take some of your fun away from you. And we are stopping that. Thank you all, and God bless you all. And we are now going to go and talk to the VFW.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmemberstherepublicannationalcommitteeandthereaganbushcampaignstaff", "title": "Remarks to Members of the Republican National Committee and the Reagan-Bush Campaign Staff in Dallas, Texas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-members-the-republican-national-committee-and-the-reagan-bush-campaign-staff", "publication_date": "24-08-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 601, "text": "On the eve of another election, I have come home to Hyde Park and am sitting at my own fireside in my own election district, my own County and my own State. I have often expressed my feeling that the mere fact that I am President should not disqualify me from expressing as a citizen my views on candidates and issues in my own State. I have changed my mind about the nature of some problems of democratic government over the past few years as I have had more and more experience with them. I had never realized how much my way of thinking had changed until the other day when I was watching the finishing touches being put on a simple cottage I have recently built-a little cottage which, by the way, is not in any sense of the word a dream house. Just watching the building go up made me realize that there was a time not so long ago when I used to think about problems of government as if they were the same kind of problems as building a house-definite and compact and capable of completion within a given time. Now I know well that the comparison is not a good one. Once you build a house you always have it. On the other hand, a social or an economic gain is a different matter. A social or an economic gain made by one Administration, for instance, may, and often does, evaporate into thin air under the next Administration. We all remember well known examples of what an ill-advised shift from liberal to conservative leadership can do to an incompleted liberal program. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, started a march of progress during his seven years in the Presidency but, after four years of President Taft, little was left of the progress that had been made. Think of the great liberal achievements of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom and how quickly they were liquidated under President Harding. We have to have reasonable continuity in liberal government in order to get permanent results. The whole United States concedes that we in the State of New York have carried out a magnificent liberal program through our State government during the past sixteen years. If the continuity of that liberal government had been broken in this State during that time, we would be nowhere near the point we have reached today. The voters throughout the country should remember that need for continuous liberal government when they vote next Tuesday. On that day in every state the oldest of modern democracies will hold an election. A free people will have a free choice to pick free leaders for free men. In other lands across the water the flares of militarism and conquest, terrorism and intolerance, have vividly revealed to Americans for the first time since the Revolution how precious and extraordinary it is to be allowed this free choice of free leaders for free men. No one next Tuesday will order us how to vote, and the only watchers we shall find at the polls are the watchers who guarantee that our ballot is secret. Think how few places are left where this can happen. But we cannot carelessly assume that a nation is strong and great merely because it has a democratic form of government. We have learned that a democracy weakened by internal dissension, by mutual suspicion born of social injustice, is no match for autocracies which are ruthless enough to repress internal dissension. Democracy in order to live must become a positive force in the daily lives of its people. It must make men and women whose devotion it seeks, feel that it really cares for the security of every individual; that it is tolerant enough to inspire an essential unity among its citizens; and that it is militant enough to maintain liberty against social oppression at home and against military aggression abroad. The rest of the world is far closer to us in every way than in the days of democracy's founders-Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln. Comparisons in this world are unavoidable. To disprove the pretenses of rival systems, democracy must be an affirmative, up-to-date conception. It can no longer be negative-no longer adopt a defeatist attitude. In these tense and dangerous situations in the world, democracy will save itself with the average man and woman by proving itself worth saving. Too many of those who prate about saving democracy are really only interested in saving things as they were. Democracy should concern itself also with things as they ought to be. I am not talking mere idealism; I am expressing realistic necessity. I reject the merely negative purposes proposed by old-line Republicans and Communists alike-for they are people whose only purpose is to survive against any other Fascist threat than their own. As of today, Fascism and Communism-and old-line Tory Republicanism-are not threats to the continuation of our form of government. But I venture the challenging statement that if American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force, seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens, then Fascism and Communism, aided, unconsciously perhaps, by old-line Tory Republicanism, will grow in strength in our land. It will take cool judgment for our people to appraise the repercussions of change in other lands. And only a nation completely convinced-at the bottom as well as at the top-that their system of government best serves their best interests, will have such a cool judgment. And while we are developing that coolness of judgment, we need in public office, above all things, men wise enough to avoid passing incidents where passion and force try to substitute themselves for judgment and negotiation. During my four years as Governor of the State of New York and during my nearly six years as President, I am proud of the fact that I have never called out the armed forces of the State or Nation except on errands of mercy. That type of democratic wisdom was illustrated last year by the action of Governor Murphy of Michigan when he persuaded the negotiators of the employers and employees to sit around a table. Thus he got an agreement, avoided bloodshed, and earned the praise of both sides of a controversy that had frightened a whole nation. With such an approach, the New Deal, keeping its feet on the ground, is working out hundreds of current problems from day to day as necessities arise and with whatever materials are at hand. We are doing this without attempting to commit the Nation to any ism or any ideology except democracy, humanity and the civil liberties which form their foundations. Our economic and social system cannot deny the paramount right of the millions who toil and the millions who wish to toil, to have it function smoothly and efficiently. After all, any such system must provide efficiently for distributing national resources and serving the welfare and happiness of all who live under it. The modern interdependent industrial and agricultural society which we live in is like a large factory. Each member of the organization has his own job to perform on the assembly line, but if the conveyor belt breaks or gets tangled up, no one in the factory, no matter how hard he tries, can do his own particular job. Each of us-farmer, business man or worker-suffers when anything goes wrong with the conveyor belt. If our democracy is to survive it must give the average man reasonable assurance that the belt will be kept moving. Dictators have recognized that problem. They keep the conveyor belt moving-but at a terrible price to the individual and to his civil liberty. The New Deal has been trying to keep those belts moving without paying such a price. It does not wish to run or manage any part of our economic machine which private enterprise can run and keep running. That should be left to individuals, to corporations, to any other form of private management, with profit for those who manage well. But when an abuse interferes with the ability of private enterprise to keep the national conveyor belt moving, government has a responsibility to eliminate that abuse. We do not assume for a minute that all we have done is right or all that we have done has been successful, but our economic and social program of the past five and a half years has definitely given to the United States of America a more stable and less artificial prosperity than any other nation in the world has enjoyed in that period. The very fact that the business slump that began last fall and kept running into last summer did not become a major economic disaster, like the terrible slump that ran from 1929 all the way through to 1933, is the best kind of proof that fundamentally we have found the right track. You have just heard the news about the automobile factories and many other industries that are opening up for full employment again. And during the month of October alone over-all employment has risen nearly 3 1/2 per cent. I have been very happy in the last six months to see how swiftly a large majority of businessmen have been coming around to accept the objectives of a more stable economy and of certain necessary supervision of private activities in order to prevent a return of the serious abuses and conditions of the past. But if there should be any weakening of the power of a liberal government next Tuesday, it would resurrect false hopes on the part of some businessmen who are now beginning to change antiquated ideas, hopes that if they can hold out just a little longer no adaptation to change will be necessary. There is no doubt of the basic desires of the American people. And because these basic desires are well known you find all parties, all candidates, making the same general promises to satisfy these desires. During the weeks before a general election, all parties are the friends of labor, all parties are against monopoly, all parties say that the unemployed must have work or be given government relief, and all parties love the farmer. Let me warn you now, as I warned you two years ago in my address at Syracuse, against the type of smooth evasion which says: Of course we believe all these things; we believe in social security; we believe in work for the unemployed; we believe in saving homes. Cross our hearts and hope to die, we believe in all these things; but we do not like the way the present Administration is doing them. Just turn them over to us. We will do all of them-we will do more of them-we will do them better; and, most important of all, the doing of them will not cost anybody anything. But when democracy struggles for its very life, those same people obstruct our efforts to maintain it, while they fail to offer proof of their own will and their own plans to preserve it. They try to stop the only fire engine we have from rushing to the fire because they are sales agents for a different make of fire engine. New ideas cannot be administered successfully by men with old ideas, for the first essential of doing a job well is the wish to see the job done at all. Judge parties and candidates, not merely by what they promise, but by what they have done, by their records in office, by the kind of people they travel with, by the kind of people who finance and promote their campaigns. By their promoters ye shall know them. No national administration, however much it may represent the genuine popular will of the people, can in the long run prove enduringly effective if that administration can be cut off from the people by state and local political machinery controlled by men who are hostile. My own State of New York is to choose a Governor. Ours is the most complex state in the Union-thirteen million population, great farming areas, hundreds of small communities, one huge city of seven million people, and many other cities, great and small. In 1918, twenty years ago, when I was thirty-six years old, I was invited to run for the Governorship of this State. I was then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. I declined the offer, because my job required me at that time to sail on a destroyer for overseas service. I am glad I did, for, looking back on that time, I do not think that I had experience and knowledge of public affairs wide enough to qualify as Governor. Besides, I did not think it quite right to abandon in mid-stream an important public job that I had undertaken. Governing the State of New York is more than being an Assistant Secretary of the Navy or a local District Attorney. The Governor of this State is called upon to administer eighteen great departments of government and to supervise state institutions that house over one hundred thousand wards of the State. He must be able to understand, and handle the vast and intricate problems of agriculture. He is charged with the supervision of State finance and the maintenance of the State credit. He is responsible for its widespread system of roads, parks, canals, bridges and schools. He has to maintain, preserve and improve the great body of social legislation already on the statute books of the State-unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation, social security, help for the needy and the underprivileged; and he must see to it that these recent reforms are made to keep pace with the broadening conception of social justice. Equal protection of the law- criminal and civil- for human rights as well as property rights; prosecution of criminals in high financial places as well as in low places; the preservation of civil and religious liberties-all these precious essentials of civilization are entrusted to him. New York has State laws matching every progressive Federal measure of the last five years. They were all enacted under the guiding hand and driving energy of Governor Herbert H. Lehman. Recruits in the battle for economic democracy are always welcome irrespective of party; but at a critical moment in the world's history we cannot take the risk of supplanting seasoned leaders like Governor Lehman with men, no matter how sincere, who have yet to win their spurs or prove what they really know or where they really stand in the fight for social justice. Those who truly and sincerely join the struggle for social justice, economic democracy for its own sake, do not throw stones at veteran fighters in that cause. No one can properly minimize the need of active law enforcement, whether it be in-a great city or in the rural counties of this or any other state. Certainly Governor Lehman has never minimized it, and has never hesitated to call to his assistance in law enforcement, young and vigorous prosecutors, irrespective of politics. We need more active law enforcement, not only against the lords of the underworld, but also against the lords of the over world. It is right-wholly right-to prosecute criminals. But that is not enough, for there is the immense added task of working for the elimination of present and future crime by getting rid of evil social conditions which breed crime. Good government can prevent a thousand crimes for every one it punishes. The fight for social justice and economic democracy has not the allure of a criminal jury trial; it is a long, weary, uphill struggle- and those who give themselves unsparingly to it are seldom acclaimed at my lady's tea or at my gentleman's club. As a resident and voter in the State of New York I urge my fellow citizens and voters, who are interested in preserving good government and American democracy, to vote for Herbert H. Lehman. Just as a Governor is required to be much more than a good prosecutor, so a United States Senator must be much more than a good lawyer. A Senator from New York must do more than merely vote on whatever bills happen to drift by. He must be able and willing to take the initiative-to keep the legislative wheels turning in the right direction. If you were to list some of the newly recognized major responsibilities of government to meet the complexities of modern. life-security in old age, unemployment insurance, protection of the rights of labor, low-cost housing, and slum clearance you would have a virtual resume of the Acts of the Congress that bear the name of Robert F. Wagner. So often since 1933 has new legislation been described as The Wagner Act that the phrase has become confusing because there have been so many Wagner Acts. For example, there is not only the Wagner Labor Relations Act; there are the Wagner Social Security Act and the Wagner Housing Act; and although you might feel uncertain as to which particular Act is meant by the phrase, you can feel no uncertainty as to this-that any one of the Wagner Acts was an Act intended for the benefit of those who need the help and support of government against oppression and against intolerable conditions of living. His name stands in our history for courageous and intelligent leadership, constructive statecraft and steadfast devotion to the common man and the cause of civil liberties. With him I hope the voters of this State will send to the Senate in Washington an experienced Member of the House of Representatives-James M. Mead-known through many years for his expert knowledge of three fields whose intricate problems press heavily upon government today-railroads, aviation and Civil Service, and for his unflagging support of every liberal measure that has come before the Congress. We need that legislative experience, that temper of mind, that expert knowledge in the United States Senate. Look over the rest of the names on the ballot next Tuesday. Pick those who are known for their experience and their liberalism. Pick them for what they have done, and not just for what they say they might do. And one last but important word: Pick them without regard to race, color or creed. Some of them may have come of the earliest Colonial stock; some of them may have been brought here as children to escape the tyrannies of the Old World. But remember that all of them are good American citizens now. Remember that the Fathers of the American Revolution represented many religions and came from many foreign lands. Remember that no matter what their origin they all agreed with Benjamin Franklin in that crisis: We must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately. Remember that in these grave days in the affairs of the world we need internal unity-national unity.

But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I'd like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Yesterday I approved a major disaster declaration for California-spoke to Governor Newsom-as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their State. That continues. The Federal Government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires. We are working very closely with the Governor and very closely with a lot of great State representatives and local representatives, and we will take care of the situation. But we have 26,000 first responders already. Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes. As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire, one of the biggest we have ever seen. My administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly. Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana 2 days later. This is somewhat unprecedented : the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another. Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico. We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous-and tremendous people. We have-FEMA is lined up. We have the Coast Guard ready. The Coast Guard has done a fantastic job. They do so many-they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard. I am asking all Americans in the storm's path to follow the instructions of your State and local Governments very closely. And I have approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana. FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help. They will be in there very quickly-very, very quickly. And I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I have informed him. And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go. We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California. So we have a great team. Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters. On the therapeutics front, this is what I have been looking to do for a long time. This is a great thing. Today I am pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization-and that is such a powerful term: emergency use authorization-for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It is had an incredible rate of success. Today's action will dramatically expand access to this treatment. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar. I want to thank the FDA-all of the people that have been working very hard on this. It showed tremendous potential. This is the only possible-and it is only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed-that is everybody working together. We are years ahead of approvals. We would be-if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we'd be 2 years, 3 years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you will be hearing about very soon, very shortly. To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we are removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the Federal Government. We have provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. It is a tremendous number. The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease. Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma. In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have-who have recovered-and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they have donated-but these are people recovered from the virus-to donate plasma. Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled. And today I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today, please. It is been really an incredible-just incredible people. The country has united so strongly behind this. And I will go over the numbers, but if you look at what is happened and the success that we have had that people do not talk about, the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world. You do not hear that. The European Union's case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States. Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States. And I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words. And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up-and especially over the last few days-in getting this done. The results have been incredible, and I think you will see the results even go up very substantially. So we appreciate it.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1256", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1256", "publication_date": "23-08-2020", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Donald J.

{"id": 1038, "text": "I have sought this opportunity to address you because it is clearly my duty to call your attention to the present cost of living and to urge upon you with all the persuasive force of which I am capable the legislative measures which would be most effective in controlling it and bringing it down. The prices the people of this country are paying for everything that it is necessary for them to use in order to live are not justified by a shortage in supply, either present or prospective, and are in many cases artificially and deliberately created by vicious practises which ought immediately be checked by law. They constitute a burden upon us which is the more unbearable because we know that it is wilfully imposed by those who have the power and that it can by vigorous public action be greatly lightened and made to square with the actual conditions of supply and demand. Some of the methods by which these' prices are produced are already illegal, some of them criminal, and those who employ them will be energetically proceeded against ; but others have not yet been brought under the law, and should be dealt with at once by legislation. I need not recite the particulars of this critical matter, the prices demanded and paid at the sources of supply, at the factory, in the food markets, at the shops, in the restaurants and hotels, alike in the city and in the village. They are familiar to you. They are the talk of every domestic circle and of every group of casual acquaintances even. It is a matter. of familiar knowledge, also, that a process has set in which is likely, unless something is done, to push prices and rents and the whole cost of living higher and yet higher, in a vicious cycle to which there is no logical or natural end. With the increase in the prices of the necessaries of life come demands for increase in wages demands which are justified if there be no other means of enabling men to live. Upon the increase of wages there follows close an increase in the price of the products whose producers have been accorded the increase not a proportionate increase, for the manufacturer does not content himself with that but an increase considerably greater that the added wage cost and for which the added wage cost is oftentimes hardly more than an excuse. The laborers who do not get an increase in pay when they demand it are likely to strike, and the strike only makes matters worse. It checks production, it affects the railways, it prevents distribution and strips the markets, so that there is presently nothing to buy, and there is another excessive addition to prices resulting from the scarcity. These are facts and forces with which we have become only too familiar; but we are not justified because of our familiarity with them, or because of any hasty and shallow conclusion that they are natural and inevitable, in sitting inactively by and letting them work their fatal results if there is anything that we can do to check, correct, or reverse them. I have sought this opportunity to inform the Congress what the Executive is doing by way of remedy and control, and to suggest where effective legal remedies are lacking and may be supplied. We must, I think, frankly admit that there is no complete immediate remedy to be had from legislation and executive action. The free processes of supply and demand will not operate of themselves, and no legislative or Executive action can force them into full and natural operation until there is peace. There is now neither peace nor war. All the world is waiting with what unnerving fears and haunting doubts who can adequately say? waiting to know when it comes a peace in which each nation shall make shift for itself as it can, or a peace buttressed 'and supported by the will and concert of the nations that have the purpose and the power to do and to enforce what is right. Politically, economically, socially, the world is on the operating table, and it has not been possible to administer any anaesthetic. It is conscious. It even watches the capital operation upon which it knows that its hope of healthful life depends. It cannot think its business out or make plans or give intelligent and provident direction to its affairs while in such a case. Where there is no peace of mind there can be no energy in endeavor. There can be no confidence in industry, no calculable basis for credits, no confident buying or systematic selling, no certain prospect of employment, no normal restoration of business, no hopeful attempt at reconstruction or the proper reassembling of the dislocated elements of enterprise until peace has been established and, so far as may be, guaranteed. Our national life has no doubt been less radically disturbed and dismembered than the national life of other peoples whom the war more directly affected, with all its terrible ravaging and destructive force, but it has been, nevertheless, profoundly affected and disarranged, and our industries, our credits, our productive capacity, our economic processes are inextricably interwoven with those of other nations and peoples most intimately of all with the nations and peoples upon whom the chief burden and confusion of the war fell and who are now most dependent upon the cooperative action of the world. We are just now shipping more goods out of our ports to foreign markets than we ever shipped before not foodstuffs merely, but stuffs and materials of every sort ; but this is no index of what our foreign sales will continue to be or of the effect the volume of our exports will have on supplies and prices. It is impossible yet to predict how far or how long foreign purchasers will be able to find the money or the credit to pay for or sustain such purchases on such a scale; how soon or to what extent foreign manufacturers can resume their former production, foreign farmers get their accustomed crops from their own fields, foreign mines resume their former output, foreign merchants set up again their old machinery of trade with the ends of the earth. All these things must remain uncertain until peace is established and the nations of the world have concerted the methods by which normal life and industry are to be restored. All that we shall do, in the meantime, to restrain profiteering and put the life of our people upon a tolerable footing will be makeshift and provisional. There can be no settled conditions here or elsewhere until the treaty of peace is out of the way and the work of liquidating the war has become the chief concern of our Government and of other Governments of the world. Until then business will inevitably remain speculative, and sway now this way and again that, with heavy losses or heavy gains, as it may chance, and. the consumer must take care of both the gains and the losses. There can be no peace prices so long as our whole financial and economic system is on a war basis. Europe will not, cannot, recoup her capital or put her restless, distracted peoples to work until she knows exactly where she stands in respect of peace; and what we will do is for her the chief question upon which her quietude of mind and confidence of purpose depend. While there is any possibility that the peace terms may be changed or may be held long in abeyance or may not be enforced because of divisions of opinion among the powers associated against Germany, it is idle to look for permanent relief. But what we can do we should do, and should do at once. And there is a great deal that we can do, provisional though it be. Wheat shipments and credits to facilitate the purchase of our wheat can and will be limited and controlled in such a way as not to raise, but rather to lower, the price of flour here. The Government has the power, within certain limits, to regulate that. We cannot deny wheat to foreign peoples who are in dire need of it, and we do not wish to do so; but, fortunately, though the wheat crop is not what we hoped it would be, it is abundant, if handled with provident care. The price of wheat is lower in the United States than in Europe, and can with proper management be kept so. By way of immediate relief, surplus stocks of both food and clothing in the hands of the Government will be sold, and, of course, sold at prices at which there is no profit. And by way of a more permanent correction of prices, surplus stocks in private hands will be drawn out of storage and put upon the market. Fortunately, under the terms of the Food Control act the hoarding of foodstuffs can be checked and prevented; and they will be, with the greatest energy. Foodstuffs can be drawn out of storage and sold by legal action, which the Department of Justice will institute wherever necessary; but so soon as the situation is systematically dealt with, it is not likely that the courts will often have to be resorted to. Much of the accumulating of stocks has no doubt been due to the sort of speculation which always results from an uncertainty. Great surpluses were accumulated because it was impossible to foresee what the market would disclose and dealers were determined to be ready for whatever might happen, as well as eager to reap the full advantage of rising prices. They will now see the disadvantage, as well as the danger, of holding off from the new process of distribution. Some very interesting and significant facts with regard to stocks on hand and the rise of prices in the face of abundance have been disclosed by, the inquiries of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, and the Federal Trade Commission. They seem to justify the statement that in the case of many necessary commodities effective means have been found to prevent the normal operation of the law of supply and demand. Disregarding the surplus stocks in the hands of the Government, there was a greater supply of foodstuffs in this country on June I of this year than at the same date last year. In the combined total of a number of the most important foods in dry and cold storage the excess is quite 19 per cent. And yet prices have risen. The supply of fresh eggs on hand in June of this year, for example, was greater by nearly Jo per cent than the supply on hand at the same time last year, and yet the wholesale price was 40 cents a dozen as against 3o cents a year ago. The stock of frozen fowls had increased more than 298 per cent., and yet the price had risen also from 34 1/2 cents per pound to 37 1/2 cents. The supply of creamery butter had increased 129 per cent., and the price from 41 to 53 cents per pound. The supply of salt beef had been augumented 3 per cent., and the price had gone up from $34 a barrel to $36 a barrel. Canned corn had increased in stock nearly 92 per cent., and had remained substantially the same in price. In a few foodstuffs the prices had declined, but in nothing like the proportion in which the supply had increased. For example, the stock of canned tomatoes had increased 102 per cent., and yet the price had declined only 25 cents per dozen cans. In some cases there had been the usual result of an increase of price following a decrease of supply, but in almost every instance the increase of price had been disproportionate to the decrease in stock. The Attorney General has been making a careful study of the situation as a whole and of the laws that can be applied to better it, and is convinced that, under the stimulation and temptation of exceptional circumstances, combinations of producers and combinations of traders have been formed for the control of supplies and of prices which are clearly in restraint of trade, and against these, prosecutions will be promptly instituted and actively pushed which will in all likelihood have a prompt corrective effect. There is reason to believe that the prices of leather, of coal, of lumber, and of textiles have been materially affected by forms of concert and cooperation among the producers and marketers of these and other universally necessary commodities which it will be possible to redress. No watchful or energetic effort will be spared to accomplish this necessary result. I trust that there will not be many cases in which prosecution will be necessary. Public action will no doubt cause many who have perhaps unwittingly adopted illegal methods to abandon them promptly and of their own motion. And publicity can accomplish a great deal. The purchaser can often take care of himself if he knows the facts and influences he is dealing with; and purchasers are not disinclined to do anything, either singly or collectively, that may be necessary for their selfprotection. The Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, and the Federal Trade Commission can do a great deal toward supplying the public, systematically and at short intervals), with information regarding the actual supply of particular commodities that is in existence and available, and with regard to supplies which are in existence but not available because of hoarding, and with regard to the methods of price fixing which are being used by dealers in certain foodstuffs and other necessaries. There can be little doubt that retailers are in part sometimes in large part responsible for exorbitant prices; and it is quite practicable for the Government through the agencies I have mentioned to supply the public with full information as 'to the prices at which retailers buy and as to the cost of transportation they pay, in order that it may be known just what margin of profit they, are demanding. Opinion and concerted action on the part of purchasers can probably do the rest. That is, these agencies may perform this indispensable service provided the Congress will supply them with the necessary funds to prosecute their inquiries and keep their price lists up to date. Hitherto the appropriation committee of the Houses have not always, I fear, seen the full value of these inquiries, and the departments and commissions have been very much straitened for means to render this service. That adequate funds be provided by appropriation for this purpose, and provided as promptly as possible, is one of the means of greatly ameliorating the present distressing conditions of livelihood that I have come to urge, in this attempt to concert with you the best ways to serve the country in this emergency. It is one of the absolutely necessary means, underlying many others, and can be supplied at once. There are many other ways. Existing law is inadequate. There are many perfectly legitimate methods by which the Government can exercise restraint and guidance. Let me urge, in the first place, that the present Food Control Act should be extended, both as to the period of time during which it shall remain in operation and as to the commodities to which it shall apply. Its provisions against hoarding should be made to apply not only to food, but also to feedstuffs, to fuel, to clothing, and to many other commodities which are indispensably necessaries of life. As it stands now, it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal, proclamation of peace. But I should judge that it was clearly within the constitutional power of the Congress to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce, and to exclude them from interstate shipment if the requirements of law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. May I not call attention to the fact, also, that, although, the present act prohibits profiteering, the prohibition is accompanied by no penalty? It is clearly in the public interest that a penalty should be provided which will be persuasive. To the same end I earnestly recommend, in the second place, that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the methods of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went in storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. It would serve as a useful example to the other communities of the country, as well as greatly relieve local distress, if the Congress were to regulate all such matters very fully for the District of Columbia, where its legislative authority is without limit. I would also recommend that it be required that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer. Such a requirement would bear a close analogy to certain provisions of the Pure Food Act, by which it is required that certain detailed information be given on the labels of packages of food and drugs. And it does not seem to me that we can confine ourselves to detailed measures of this kind, if .it is indeed our purpose to assume national control of the processes of distribution. I take it for granted that that is our purpose and our duty. Nothing less will suffice. We need not hesitate to handle a national question in a national way. We should go beyond the measures I have suggested. We should formulate a law requiring a Federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the' business of interstate shipment and in the methods of corporations which are engaged in it ; but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living. May I not add that there is a bill now pending before Congress which, if passed, would do much to stop speculation and to prevent the fraudulent methods of promotion by which our people are annually fleeced of many millions of hard earned money? I refer to the measure proposed by the Capital Issues Committee for the control of security issues. It is a measure formulated by men who know the actual conditions of business, and its adoption would serve a great and beneficent purpose. We are dealing, gentlemen of the Congress, I need hardly say, with, very critical and very difficult matters. We should go forward with confidence along the road we see, but we shall also seek to comprehend the whole of the scene amidst which we act. There is no ground for some of the fearful forecasts I hear uttered about me, but the condition of the world is unquestionably very grave and we should face it comprehendingly. The situation of our own country is exceptionally fortunate. We of all peoples can afford to keep our heads and to determine upon moderate sensible courses, of action which will insure us against the passions and distempers which are working such deep unhappiness for some of the distressed nations on the other side of the sea. But we may be involved in their distresses unless we help, and help with energy and intelligence. The world must pay for the appalling destruction wrought by the Great War, and we are part of the world. We must pay our share. For five years now the industry of all Europe has been slack and disordered. The normal crops have not been produced; the normal quantity of manufactured goods has not been turned out. Not until there are the usual crops and the usual production of manufactured goods on the other side of the Atlantic can Europe return to the former conditions; and it was upon the former conditions, not the present, that our economic relations with Europe were built up. We must face the fact that unless we help Europe to get back to her normal life and production a chaos will ensue there which will inevitably be communicated to this country. For the present, it is manifest, we must quicken, not slacken, our own production. We, and we alone, now hold the world steady. Upon our steadfastness and selfpossession depend the affairs of nations everywhere. It is in this supreme crisis the crisis for all mankind that America must prove her mettle. In the presence of a world confused, distracted, she must show herself selfpossessed, selfcontained, capable of sober and effective action. She saved Europe by her action in arms; she must now save it by her action in peace. In saving Europe she will save herself, as she did upon the battlefields of the war. The calmness and capacity with which she deals with and masters the problems of peace will be the final test and proof of her place among the peoples of the world. And, if only in our own interest, we must help the people overseas. Europe is our biggest customer. We must keep her going or thousands of our shops and scores of our mines must close. There is no such thing as letting her go to ruin without ourselves sharing in the disaster. In such circumstances, face to face with such tests, passion must be discarded. Passion and a disregard for the rights of others have no place in the counsels of a free people. We need light, not heat, in these solemn times of selfexamination and saving action. There must be no threats. Let there be only intelligent counsel, and let the best reasons win, not the strongest brute force. The world has just' destroyed the arbitrary force of a military junta. It will live under no other. All that is arbitrary and coercive is in the discard. Those who seek to employ it only prepare their own destruction. We cannot hastily and overnight revolutionize all the processes of our economic life. We shall not attempt to do so. These are days of deep excitement and of extravagant speech; but with us these are things of the surface. Everyone who is in real touch with the silent masses of our great people knows that the old strong fibre and steady selfcontrol are still there, firm against violence or any distempered action that would throw their affairs into confusion. I am serenely confident that they will readily find themselves, no matter what the circumstances, and that they will address themselves to the tasks of peace with the same devotion and the same stalwart preference for what is right that they displayed to the admiration of the whole world in the midst of war. And I entertain another confident hope. I have spoken today chiefly of measures of imperative regulation and legal compulsion, of prosecutions and the sharp correction of selfish processes; and these no doubt are necessary. But there are other forces that we may count on besides those resident in the Department of Justice. We have just fully awakened to what has been going on and to the influences, many of them very selfish and sinister, that have been producing high prices and imposing an intolerable burden on the mass of our people. To have brought it all into the open will accomplish the greater part of the result we seek. I appeal with entire confidence to our producers, our middlemen, and our merchants to deal fairly with the people. It is their opportunity to show that they comprehend, that they intend to act justly, and that they have the public interest sincerely at heart. And I have no doubt that housekeepers all over the country and every one who buys the things he daily stands in need of will presently exercise a greater vigilance, a more thoughtful economy, a more discriminating care as to the market in which he buys or the merchant with whom he trades than he has hitherto exercised. I believe, too, that the more extreme leaders of organized labor will presently yield to a sober second thought and, like the great mass of their associates, think and act like true Americans. They will see that strikes undertaken at this critical time are certain to make matters worse, not better worse for them and for everybody else. The worst thing, the most fatal thing, that can be done now is to stop or interrupt production or to interfere with the distribution of goods by the railways and the shipping of the country. We are all involved in the distressing results of the high cost of living, and we must unite, not divide, to correct it. There are many things that ought to be corrected in the relations between capital and labor, in respect of wages and conditions of labor, and other things even more farreaching, and I, for one, am ready to go into conference about these matters with any group of my fellow countrymen who know what they are talking about and are willing to remedy existing conditions by frank counsel rather than by violent contest. No remedy is possible while men are in a temper, and there can be no settlement which does not have as its motive and standard the general interest. Threats and undue insistence upon the interest of a single class make settlement impossible. I believe, as I have hitherto had occasion to say to the Congress, that the industry and life of our people and of the world will suffer irreparable damage if employers and workmen are to go on in a perpetual contest as antagonists. They must, on one plan or another, be effectively associated. Have we not steadiness and selfpossession and business sense enough to work out that result? Undoubtedly we have, and we shall work it out. In the meantime now and in the days of readjustment and recuperation that are ahead of us let us resort more and more to frank and intimate counsel and make ourselves a great and triumphant nation by making ourselves a united force in the life of the world. It will not then have looked to us for leadership in vain.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressthehighcostliving", "title": "Address to Congress On the High Cost of Living", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-the-high-cost-living", "publication_date": "08-08-1919", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 964, "text": "We hold a statewide festival and mark the day with lei draping ceremonies, parades, hula competitions and other festivities. It is a day to honor Kamehameha the Great, who unified the Kingdom of Hawaii, and to celebrate the rich culture and traditions of the Hawaiian people. I chose this day to come to the Senate Floor to talk about an issue of great importance to me and to my state: Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization. It was a top priority of my immediate predecessors in this body - Senators Inouye and Akaka. For more than three decades they worked together in the Congress to advance priorities important to Hawaii and the nation. They made history at almost every step of their careers - securing dozens of firsts in the House and Senate. But for the indigenous people of the United States - Senators Inouye and Akaka will be forever remembered for their work as members and then chairs of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and for their advocacy on behalf of American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. I want to acknowledge their legacy and to thank Senator Akaka for the role that he continues to play in the great State of Hawaii and in the Native Hawaiian community in particular. And, here is the reason that I have chosen to carry forward this fight on behalf of Native Hawaiians. Simply stated: because it is right to seek justice. Native Hawaiians are the only federally recognized Native people without a government-to-government relationship with the United States and they deserve access to the prevailing federal policy of self-determination. Opponents have argued that Native Hawaiians are not Indians as if the word applies to Native people of a certain racial or ethnic heritage or is limited to indigenous people from one part of the United States, but not another. This is misguided. In the U.S. Constitution, it is clear our Founding Fathers understood it was the tribal nations' sovereign authority that distinguished them from others. It was the fact that tribes were Native groups with distinct governments that predated our own, that justified special treatment in the Constitution and under our federal laws. In what is now the United States, European contact with Native groups, began in the 15th and 16th centuries on the East Coast, and the 16th and 17th centuries on the West Coast; while in Alaska and Hawaii, European contact was delayed until the 18th century. Throughout the centuries a myriad of factors influenced how various Native groups were treated. The historical timeframe when policies and programs were applied to various Native groups may have been different. But what was consistent throughout, were the federal policies and actions intended to strip Native Americans of their languages, weaken traditional leadership and family structures, divide land bases, prohibit religious and cultural practices, and break communal bonds. And, these policies were as harmful and unjust to Native Hawaiians as they were to Alaska Natives and American Indians. There was a thriving society that greeted Captain James Cook when he landed on the shores of Hawaii in 1778. Prior to their first contact with Europeans, Native Hawaiians had a population of at least 300,000. They were a highly organized, self-sufficient society and they had their own rules, laws, language and culture. In his journals, Captain Cook referred to the indigenous people of Hawaii as Indians because it was the established English term in the 18th century to describe Native groups -regardless of their race, ethnicity or their governmental structure. But, just like many Native Americans and Alaska Natives on the continent, the name Native Hawaiians chose in their own language was -Kanaka Maoli - The People. From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Government as a distinct political entity. We extended full and complete diplomatic recognition, and entered into five treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation. These treaties are clear evidence that Native Hawaiians were considered a separate and distinct nation more than a century after contact. But, on January 17, 1893, the legitimate government of the Native Hawaiian people was removed forcibly, by agents and armed forces of the United States. The illegality of this action has been acknowledged in contemporary as well as modern times by both the Executive and Legislative branches of our federal government. An investigation called for by President Cleveland produced a report by former Congressman James Blount. The report's findings were unambiguous: U.S. diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in the government. As a result of these findings, the United States Minister to Hawaii was recalled from his diplomatic post and the military commander of the United States armed forces stationed in Hawaii was disciplined and forced to resign his commission. In a message to Congress in December of 1893, President Cleveland described the events that brought down the Hawaiian Government as an act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic representative of the United States and without authority of Congress. And, he acknowledged that by such acts, the government of a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown. President Cleveland concluded that a substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character -as well as the rights of the injured people - requires we should endeavor to repair and he called for the restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy. The Provisional Government refused to relinquish power and in July of 1894, declared itself to be the Republic of Hawaii. TheProvisional Government advocated annexation of Hawaii to the United States and began to lobby the Congress to pass a treaty of annexation. Hawaii's monarch at the time, Queen Liliuokalani, presented a petition to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a formal statement of protest to the Secretary of State. The petition, signed by more than 21,000 Hawaiian men and women, represented more than half of the Hawaiian census population and was compiled in less than three weeks. It also included the signatures of approximately 20,000 non-Hawaiians who supported the return of the islands to self-governed rule. The Petition Against Annexation was a powerful tool in the defeat of the annexation treaty in 1897. In the next year, however, proponents of annexation introduced the Newlands Joint Resolution, a measure requiring only a simple majority of votes to gain passage. The annexation of Hawaii passed with the much reduced threshold of votes, and was signed into law by President McKinley in July of 1898. For almost two centuries after the founding of our nation, federal policies of removal, relocation, assimilation and termination, decimated Native communities and worsened the socio-economic conditions for American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. The policy of banning Native language use in the schools was adopted by the territory of Hawaii. Native children were punished for speaking Hawaiian, just as American Indians and Alaska Natives were punished for using their own languages in school. The policy of allotting parcels of land to individual Indians began in 1887, as a way to break up the reservations and communal lifestyles. In 1906, it was expanded to include Alaska Natives. In 1921, it was applied to Native Hawaiians. In an attempt to reverse the damage done by these policies, since the 1920's, the Congress has established special Native Hawaiian programs in education, employment, health care and housing. And, the Congress has extended to Native Hawaiians many of the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Congress has consistently recognized Native Hawaiians as native peoples of the United States on whose behalf it may exercise its powers under the Constitution. In 1993, the Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, legislation known as the Apology Resolution - a formal acknowledgement and apology by the Congress. This legislation recognizes that the overthrow of the Hawaiian government resulted in the suppression of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination. It has been 20 years since the passage of the Apology Resolution, but the federal government has not yet acted to provide a process for reorganizing a Native Hawaiian governing entity. This inaction puts Native Hawaiians at a unique disadvantage. Of the three major groups of Native Americans in the United States - American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians -only Native Hawaiians currently lack the benefits of democratic self-government. An extensive Congressional legislative and oversight record created over the last two decades, and dozens of Congressional findings delineated in federal statutes establish these facts: Indigenous Hawaiians, like tribes on the continental United States, formed a Native community with their own government; this political entity existed before the founding of the United States; and, Native Hawaiians share historical and current bonds within their community. Like tribes in the continental United States, Native Hawaiians, have certain lands set aside for their benefit pursuant to Acts of Congress, including: 200,000 acres of Hawaiian Homes Commission Act land and share an interest in the income generated by 1.2 million acres of public trust lands under the Hawaii Admission Act. Although the Congress has passed more than 150 statutes to try to address some of the negative effects of earlier federal actions and policies, data reveal persistent health, education and income disparities. Native Hawaiians experience disproportionately high rates of unemployment and incarceration; and, Native Hawaiian children are over represented in the juvenile justice system. Hawaiian families rank last in the nation in average annual pay and face the highest rates of homelessness. Separate is not equal, and that is why I urge the federal government to treat Native Hawaiians fairly. It is long past time for the Native Hawaiian people to regain their right to self-governance. Two years ago the State of Hawaii passed a historic measure to explicitly acknowledge that Native Hawaiians are the only indigenous, aboriginal, maoli population of Hawaii and to establish a Native Hawaiian Enrollment Commission. My good friend and the former Governor of Hawaii, John Waihee, was appointed Chairman and is leading the effort to register Native Hawaiians. This landmark effort is widely supported by the State of Hawaii, our Congressional delegation and our citizens. I want to acknowledge the Commission, commend its vital work, and urge Native Hawaiians to take advantage of this opportunity to help reorganize a representational government. The actions and commitments of the State of Hawaii and the Roll Commission are crucial. But, in order to reach our goal - we must all work together. That is why today - on King Kamehameha Day - I call upon all of us to join in the fight for justice for Native Hawaiians. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "schatzsenategovnewspressreleasesschatzdeliversmajorfloorspeechonachievingfairnessfornativehawaiians", "title": "Schatz Delivers Major Floor Speech On Achieving Fairness for Native Hawaiians", "source": "https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-delivers-major-floor-speech-on-achieving-fairness-for-native-hawaiians", "publication_date": "11-06-2013", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Brian Schatz"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 824, "text": "Each year we set aside a special day to pay special tribute to our men and women in uniform. Today is Armed Forces Day and, on behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to offer them our thanks and appreciation. Their job is unusually difficult not only because it involves hardship and danger, or because it requires long periods away from families and loved ones, or even because it may demand the giving of one's life in defense of our nation. The difficulty of the military profession grows out of all of these, plus the fact that our service men and women are always faced with several of the most fundamental questions we ask as individuals and as a nation the questions of war and peace and the use of force in the world. Americans have asked these questions again and again for more than 200 years. They are still debating them today. Perhaps the reason these questions persist is because there are no easy answers. The answers lie in seeming paradoxes, underlying truths that may appear contradictory on the surface. The most fundamental paradox is that if we are never to use force, we must be prepared to use it and to use it successfully. We Americans do not want war and we do not start fights. We do not maintain a strong military force to conquer or coerce others. The purpose of our military is simple and straightforward: We want to prevent war by deterring others from the aggression that causes war. If our efforts are successful, we will have peace and never be forced into battle. There will never be a need to fire a single shot. That is the paradox of deterrence. The men and women in our Armed Forces also live with a second paradox. They spend their entire time in service training to fight and preparing for a war which we and they pray will never come. As individuals, these men and women want peace as much as we do as a nation. In fact, they want it even more, because they understand that war is not the romantic heroism we read about in novels or see in the movies, but the stark truth of suffering and sacrifice and the slain promise of youth. Our service men and women know firsthand the horrors of war and the blessings of peace, but they also know that just wanting peace is not enough to guarantee that peace will be sustained. As George Washington said, To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual ways of preserving peace. Today, Americans are again asking important questions about war and peace. Many have been debating two very important questions: How could we prevent nuclear war, and how could we reduce American and Soviet nuclear arsenals? The answers to these questions are not found in simple slogans, but again, in paradoxes. To prevent nuclear war, we must have the capability to deter nuclear war. This means we must keep our strategic forces strong enough to balance those of the Soviet Union. It must be absolutely clear to the Soviets that they would have no conceivable advantage in threatening or starting a nuclear war. In seeking to reduce American and Soviet nuclear arsenals, we must convince the Soviet Union that it is in our mutual interest to agree to significant, mutual arms reductions. And to do that, we cannot allow the current nuclear imbalance to continue. We must show the Soviets that we are determined to spend what it takes to deter war. Once they understand that, we have a real chance of successfully reaching arms reduction agreements. Last month I sent to the Congress a proposal to modernize our intercontinental ballistic missile force. By building the MX Peacekeeper and small, single warhead missiles, we will not only preserve our ability to protect the peace, we will also demonstrate that any Soviet quest for nuclear superiority will not work, that it is in everyone's interest to end the arms race and to agree to mutual arms reductions. There is a direct relationship between modernization programs, like the MX Peacekeeper, and the twin objectives of deterrence and arms control. The MX and other modernization measures will help us to achieve our fundamental goal, and that is to strengthen the peace by seeking arms reduction agreements that make for more security and stability by reducing overall force levels while permitting the modernization of our forces needed for a credible deterrent. I know that the paradox of peace through a credible military posture may be difficult for some people to accept. Some even argue that if we really wanted to reduce nuclear weapons we should simply stop building them ourselves. That argument makes about as much sense as saying that the way to prevent fires is to close down the fire department. It ignores one of the most basic lessons of history, a lesson that was learned by bitter experience and passed down to us by previous generations. Tyrants are tempted by weakness, and peace and freedom can only be preserved by strength. So, let us resolve today, as we honor the brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, to give them the support they need to protect our cherished liberties and preserve the peace for ourselves and our children. Till next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationtheobservancearmedforcesday", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on the Observance of Armed Forces Day", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-the-observance-armed-forces-day", "publication_date": "21-05-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 662, "text": "Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Please, have a seat. Good afternoon, everybody. I am glad you all could join us today for this job forum here at the White House. Now, we have got leaders from just about every sector of the economy: government, labor, academia, nonprofits, and businesses of all sizes. And I know that your unions or universities or cities or companies do not run themselves, so I appreciate that you have taken the time to be here today. And I appreciate the unique perspective each of you brings to the great economic challenge before us: the continuing plight of millions of Americans who are still out of work. Sometimes in this town, we talk about these things in clinical and academic ways. But this is not an academic debate. With 1 in 10 Americans out of work and millions more underemployed, not having enough hours to support themselves, this is a struggle that cuts deep, and it touches people across this Nation. Every day, I meet people or I hear from people who talk about sending out resume after resume, and they have been on the job hunt for a year or a year and a half and still cannot find anything and are desperate. They have not just lost the paycheck they need to live; they are losing the sense of dignity and identity that comes from having a job. I hear from businessowners who face the heartbreak of having to lay off longtime employees or shutting their doors altogether, in some cases businesses that they have taken years to build, in some cases businesses that they inherited from their parents or their grandparents. And I see communities devastated by lost jobs and devastated by the fear that those jobs are never coming back. Now, as Joe mentioned, it is true that we have seen a significant turnaround in the economy overall since the beginning of the year. Our economy was in a freefall. Our financial system was on the verge of collapse. We were losing 700,000 jobs per month. And it was clear then that our first order of business was to keep a recession from slipping into a depression, from preventing financial meltdown and getting the economy growing again, because we knew that without economic growth, there would be little to nothing we could do to stem job losses. And we knew that trying to create jobs in an economy based on inflated home prices and maxed-out credit cards and overleveraged banks was akin to building a house on sand. So we implemented plans to stabilize the financial system and revive lending to families and businesses. We passed the Recovery Act, which stopped our freefall and help spur the growth that we have seen. Today, our economy is growing again for the first time in a year and at the fastest pace that we have seen in 2 years, and productivity is surging. Companies are reporting profits. The stock market is up. But despite the progress we have made, many businesses are still skittish about hiring. Some are still digging themselves out of the losses they incurred over the past year. Many have figured out how to squeeze more productivity out of fewer workers, and that cost-cutting has become embedded in their operations and in their culture. That may result in good profits, but it is not translating into hiring. And so that is the question that we have to ask ourselves today: How do we get businesses to start hiring again? How do we get ourselves to the point where more people are working and more people are spending and you start seeing a virtuous cycle and the recovery starts to feed on itself? Now, we knew from the outset of this recession-particularly a recession of this severity and a recession that is spurred on by financial crisis rather than as a consequence of the business cycle-that it would take time for job growth to catch up with economic growth. We all understood that. That is always been the case with recessions. But we cannot hang back and hope for the best when we have seen the kinds of job losses that we have seen over the last year. I am not interested in taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to creating jobs. What I am interested in is taking action right now to help businesses create jobs-right now, in the near term. And that is why we made more credit available to small banks that provide loans to small businesses. That is why we provided tax relief to help small businesses stay afloat and proposed raising SBA loan limits to help them expand. That is why we created the Cash for Clunkers program and made sure the Recovery Act included investments that would start saving and creating jobs this year, as Joe mentioned, as many as 1.6 * so far is estimated, according to the most recent analysis. And that is why I have been working continuously with my economic advisers as well as congressional leaders and others on new job creation ideas. And I will be speaking in greater detail about several ideas that have already surfaced early next week. But I want to be clear: While I believe that government has a critical role in creating the conditions for economic growth, ultimately, true economic recovery is only going to come from the private sector. We do not have enough public dollars to fill the hole of private dollars that was created as a consequence of the crisis. It is only when the private sector starts to reinvest again, only when our businesses start hiring again and people start spending again and families start seeing improvement in their own lives again that we are going to have the kind of economy that we want. That is the measure of a real economic recovery. So that is why we have invited all of you here today. Many of you run businesses yourselves. Each of you is an expert on some aspect of job creation. Collectively, your views span the spectrum. That was deliberate. We have looking for fresh perspectives and new ideas. I want to hear about what unions and universities can do to better support and prepare our workers, not just for the jobs of today, but for the jobs 5 years from now and 10 years from now and 50 years from now. I want to hear about what mayors and community leaders can do to bring new investment to our cities and towns and help recovery dollars get to where they need to go as quickly as possible. I want to hear from CEOs about what is holding back business investment and how we can increase confidence and spur hiring. And if there are things that we are doing here in Washington that are inhibiting you, then we want to know about it. And I want to continue this conversation outside of Washington, which is why I will be meeting with some of the small-business owners that you saw in the video, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, tomorrow to get their ideas. It is also why we have asked State and local officials and community organizations to hold their own jobs forums over the next week or so and to report back with the ideas and recommendations that result. Now, let me be clear : I am open to every demonstrably good idea, and I want to take every responsible step to accelerate job creation. We also, though, have to face the fact that our resources are limited. When we walked in, there was an enormous fiscal gap between the money that is going out and the money coming in. The recession has made that worse because of fewer tax receipts and more demands made on government for things like unemployment insurance. So we cannot make any ill-considered decisions right now, even with the best of intentions. We are going to have to be surgical, and we are going to have to be creative. We are going to have to be smart and strategic. We will need to look beyond the old standbys and fallbacks and come up with the best ideas that give us the biggest bang for the buck. So I need everybody here to bring their A-game here today. I am going to be asking some tough questions. I will be listening for some good answers. And I do not want to just brainstorm up at 30,000 feet. I want details in our discussion today. I am looking for specific recommendations that can be implemented that will spur on job growth as quickly as possible. Now, I want to be clear: We will not overcome our unemployment challenge in just a few hours this afternoon. I assure you there is extraordinary skepticism that any discussions like this can actually produce results. I am well aware of that. I do not mind skepticism. If I listened to the skeptics, I would not be here. But I am confident that we will make progress. I am confident that people like you, who've built thriving businesses or revolutionized industries or brought cities and communities together and changed the way we look at the world and innovated and created new products, that you can come up with some additional good ideas on how to create jobs. And I am confident that the spirit of bold, persistent experimentation that FDR talked about and that is gotten this country through some of our darkest hours remains alive and well, not just in this room, but all across the country. We still have the best universities in the world. We have got some of the finest science and technology in the world. We have got the most entrepreneurial spirit in the world, and we have got some of the most productive workers in the world. And if we get serious, then the 21st century is going to be the American century, just like the 20th century was. But we are going to have to approach this with a sense of seriousness and try to set the politics and the chatter aside for a while and actually get to work. So welcome. Thank you for participating. We are going to maximize the productivity of this effort over the next several hours. And I will be returning back with you so that I can get a report on what kinds of ideas seem to make the most sense. Thank you very much, everybody.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheopeningsessionthejobsandeconomicgrowthforum", "title": "Remarks at the Opening Session of the Jobs and Economic Growth Forum", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-opening-session-the-jobs-and-economic-growth-forum", "publication_date": "03-12-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1003, "text": "I apologize for being late. This is not my normal custom, but I have been working the last 15 or 20 minutes on the Rhodesian question, and something came up at the last minute. This is an afternoon ceremony that is very significant to us. I think that my own background in environmental questions and in matters that relate to the quality of life has been one of intimate and deep concern. And when I was elected president, my major purpose in dealing with Federal Government agencies that relate to energy or to environment, to the quality of life in every way, was one of appointing people in whom I had complete confidence and, also, who had the confidence of those intensely committed environmentalists and conservationists in our country. At the same time, of course, in order for us to be effective, there must be a working relationship that cannot create insuperable barriers between those who are interested in development of jobs on the one hand, those who want to protect the quality of the outdoors, the purity of life on the other. I think that we have been successful so far, without abridging anyone's deep commitment and integrity in past statements and beliefs on the one hand, and adequate progress on the other. And I am very proud this afternoon to have a chance to introduce these men and women who will be serving in such important positions. Charles Warren is a man whom I first met when I was in Plains being briefed on the major questions concerning energy. He is a person who has been very effective in California, in the legislature, in devising and drafting and implementing major and very innovative decisions concerning the energy question, environmental questions, protection of the coastal regions, not only from a present-day point of view but as they would impact on the lives of people in years to come. He is a very successful man there. And I think at some considerable sacrifice to himself, financially, but because of his interest in this subject, he is agreed to come and serve with us. And he will be the Chairman of those who will advise me on matters that relate to environmental quality. I am very glad that you have come to be with us. And I express my appreciation to you and look forward to working closely with you. Among my closest friends in the world are two people who mean a lot to me, and I think in the past and in the future will mean a lot to our country. One of them is Dr. Peter Bourne, who helped me in Georgia to set up one of the finest drug treatment programs in the Nation. He is recognized as the foremost expert on alcoholism, drugs, their impact, and the way to control them properly. His wife, Mary King, is also one who has been very close to me. When I was campaigning for ENTITY, whenever I came to Washington, not having enough support or finances to afford a hotel room, I always slept on their folding bed and they always took me in. And I am very excited to know that Mary King, who is an expert on health care in all its forms, on the proper utilization of volunteer Americans, who has a sensitivity and a courage that is absolutely superlative, is willing to serve in an agency that will spread this kind of knowledge throughout the world. The ACTION program is one that is involved with the Peace Corps, with VISTA, and with the recruitment and use of Americans--sometimes outside Government itself--who are willing to serve this country and other nations who are friends of ours. I am very grateful that Mary King is going to be the Deputy Director of ACTION. And when I asked her to serve, she said that she would do it if I would be present at her swearing-in ceremony. Nothing could have kept me away. Mary, I am very proud of you. And I know this is going to be a great experience for you and for me both. Another very crucial agency, as you know, is the Environmental Protection Agency. This is one that, in a practical way, administers the laws evolved by the Congress and the President to make sure that the agencies of Government and business world, as well, are oriented toward the protection of the quality of life. There are many aspects of it: environmental impact statements, enforcement of quality of air and water. And this requires men and women in administrative positions who are knowledgeable about law, who are thoroughly familiar with the rules that have been laid down in an administrative way, and who can deal with forcefulness and understanding with the State and local governments and with private industry to make sure that in the face of progress, which is inevitable, that we do not destroy what is precious to us. Doug Costle has had broad experience in this field and will be the Director of this agency, and another very close friend of mine, Barbara Blum, who helped me get many of the Georgia laws passed against formidable opposition because of her courage and tenacity and because of her knowledge of environmental questions while I was Governor of Georgia. And I am very grateful that they are willing to serve as the two top leaders in this important agency, the Environmental Protection Agency. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome them into the Government circles, and it is also with a great deal of pleasure that I thank them for being willing to serve. This is going to be a competent, dedicated, courageous, tough partnership. And I believe that the people of our country can rest assured that in the years to come, that our quality of life will never be abridged nor will it deteriorate. And I hope that we can set a standard in this country that will be emulated by other nations around the world as we deal with kind of an unexplored opportunity to protect the things that are precious to us. So, I am thankful to all of you for being willing to serve with us.

{"id": 593, "text": "Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thanks for having me. Thanks for the warm welcome. I appreciate the fact that a Texan is being treated so well here in Arkansas. It is nice to be in this part of the world again. Arkansas is full of really good people, decent, caring people, and so is this hospital. I am honored that you would have allowed me and my rather significant entourage--to come to Baptist Health Medical Center. I am here to talk about health issues. I am here to talk about one of the reasons why health care costs are going up. And that is the fact that we have got too many darn lawsuits, too many frivolous and junk lawsuits that are affecting people. I am here to make sure that we talk in a way that says to the people of Arkansas and America that we need medical liability reform to make sure that medicine is affordable and available. But I am here, first and foremost, to thank the people of this medical center, those here in person and those listening via cable. I want to thank you for what you do. I want to thank you for your heart. I want to thank you for caring about your fellow citizens. I appreciate very much your being on the frontline of healing, healing lives in such a compassionate way. Our health care system is the best in the world, and we need to keep it that way. I appreciate Russ. Thank you for your introduction. Thanks for being the CEO of Baptist Health System. Thank you for joining us in-we just had what they call a roundtable. The table was square. But nevertheless, we had a great discussion, and Russ was there. He talked about this hospital, its outreach, its not only desire to serve people in the city of Little Rock but also its desire to serve people in rural Arkansas. I want to thank Doug Weeks, the senior vice president and administrator, our host. I want to thank my friend the Governor for coming. Governor Huckabee is a-. Part of good health care depends on how you treat your own body. No, I am serious. I am absolutely serious. The best way to-one of the best ways to prevent disease is to make right choices. One of the right choices is to watch what you eat. The Governor has clearly done that. He is setting a good example. Another right choice is to exercise frequently. Some of us like to run-or used to like to run before we broke down. I try to exercise 6 days a week. The Governor exercises. And I hope people in Arkansas and around the country understand that the exercise is a good way to avoid disease in the first place. Making right choices is important. And Governor, I appreciate the example you have set for this great State. I want to thank the Lieutenant Governor, Win Rockefeller, for joining us. Win, glad to see you. He exercises too. I appreciate the mayor, Mayor Dailey from Little Rock, for being here. Mr. Mayor, thank you for coming. Mayor Hays of North Little Rock is here as well. Thank you for coming, appreciate you. You have got a tough job. I like to remind the mayors, just go ahead and fill the potholes, and everything will be fine. I know we have got leaders from the statehouse here, Senator Baker and Representative Parks and others. Thank you all for coming out and giving me a chance to share some thoughts with you. Before I get into the issue of health, I do want to remind you that our country still faces big challenges. And we are rising to meet the challenges. The most important job of my administration is to protect the American people, is to chase down those who would do us harm and bring them to justice, is to never forget the lessons of September the 11th, is to stay on the offensive, and that is what we are doing. We are spreading freedom, and as we do so, the world becomes more peaceful. Freedom is not America's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty's gift to each man and woman in the world. I appreciate so very much the contribution of the Arkansas Guard. Over 4,000 troops are part of our effort to not only make America more secure but to make the world more free. I know that the Governor informed me that these troops are ready to go. They understand the mission. They are proud to serve our country. I am proud to call them-I am proud to be their Commander in Chief. And I want their families to know how much we are grateful for their sacrifice as well. Arkansas ought to be proud of the men and women who wear the uniform, and they are going to make this Nation proud and more secure in their sacrifices. I told everybody the other night at the State of the Union that we are going to stay on the offensive against Al Qaida, and we are making good progress. We are on an international manhunt. We are in a different kind of war. It used to be in the old days, you could measure progress based upon the number of airplanes that the enemy had or the number of ships in a flotilla. And the big battles of the past were clashes of equipment that were visible for people to see. And this is the kind of war where sometimes you see action, and sometimes you do not . Sometimes progress is being made, and it is hard to tell it, because in order to dismantle the Al Qaida terrorists network, we have got to be on a manhunt, and we have got a lot of people on the manhunt. Just yesterday-not yesterday-just last week, we made further progress in making America more secure when a fellow named Hassan Ghul was captured in Iraq. Hassan Ghul was a-reported directly to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who was the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks. He was a killer. He was moving money and messages around South Asia and the Middle East to other Al Qaida leaders. He was a part of this network of haters that we are dismantling. Our intelligence officers did a good job. He was captured in Iraq, where he was helping Al Qaida to put pressure on our troops. There is one less enemy we have to worry about with the capture of Hassan Ghul. Our people are doing great work. This country's economy is getting better, and that is positive news for the people of Arkansas and the people of America. The tax relief we passed is working. See, I believe that when people have more money in their pocket, they will then spend or save or invest, and that causes the whole economy to grow, which then helps people find a job. Much of the tax relief we passed is set to expire, and it is set to expire right about the time the economy gets going. It makes no sense to have a tax increase on the American people at this stage or any stage as far as I am concerned. And therefore, we need to make the tax relief permanent. In order to make this tax relief permanent, let people keep more of their own money to keep driving this economy forward. Small businesses need to keep more money. You see, most new jobs in America are created by small-business owners. If you are worried about job creation, we need to continue to stimulate the small-business sector of our economy. Congress needs to act. They need to make these tax relief packages we passed for small business permanent so people can find work here in America. We also need to have an energy policy. The people of Arkansas understand energy. We need a policy. We need a policy that encourages conservation. We need a policy that helps modernize our electricity systems, and we need a policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. We need to open up markets for Arkansas' farmers and ranchers. When you are good at something, we ought to encourage the sale of those products elsewhere, outside of our markets. And we are good at things in America. We are good at growing crops, and we are good at raising cows, and we are good at being on the cutting edge of innovation. We need markets for those products. We need less regulation for businesses and small businesses. And we have got to deal with rising health care costs. Rising health care costs are making it difficult for some entities to hire people. Rising health care costs affect all Americans. We want our families to feel more secure. Rising health care costs create insecurity in our Nation. And so we need to continue the focus on costs. We are making some good progress, by the way, about helping people with health care. We have got what we call community health centers in America. I am committed to the expansion and the building of new community health centers. These are places where people who do not have insurance or live in areas without enough doctors can find health care. Community health centers make sense. It takes the pressure off the emergency rooms of hospitals such as this. We have opened or expanded 600 community health centers since 2001. The budget I proposed calls for another 218 to be opened or expanded. This is a good way to make sure that health care is available for those who do not have insurance yet. And so I call upon Congress to look at that part of my budget and continue working with the administration to expand these vital centers around Arkansas and around America. And then we worked on Medicare. You might remember what it was like before this year when people talked about Medicare. The political issue was really called Medi-scare. If somebody would talk about it, somebody else would say, Wait a minute. They are going to try to take away Medicare from the seniors. But I felt strongly that Medicare needed to be modernized. I felt like we needed to deal with the issue now and not pass it on like other Congresses and administrations had done. It is time to address the issue before it became so acute that the system did not work. And it was time to fulfill a promise to our seniors, and so we acted. I was proud to sign that bill, and as I told the Congress, If you try to change it and it hurts our seniors, I will veto the bill. It is going to take a while to implement the Medicare bill. It is a complex piece of legislation. After all, it is the first modernization since Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare in the mid-sixties. This year, seniors are going to get a drug discount card, which will save them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs. And the lowest income seniors will get a $600 credit. That will help seniors with drug costs. Secondly, next year we will begin preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease for seniors just entering Medicare, plus they will get a wellness exam. That is important. It is the first time that Medicare has actually been into the business of preventive screenings. Any good doc will tell you, you need to figure out what the issue is in order to deal with people. And a preventive screening will help the medical profession better treat our seniors. Finally, in year 2006, seniors will receive the prescription drug coverage they have been promised. For about $35 a month, most seniors will see their drug bills cut in half. That is a good deal for America's seniors. And finally, in the bill is an interesting innovation, one that is not the first time it is been tried, but it is now been expanded- they are called health savings accounts, which will allow Americans to save for future medical expenses, tax-free. And that is an important innovation, an important reform. Another way to help, by the way-or a way to help deal with rising costs is to understand the impact rising costs have on small businesses. A lot of big businesses are able to absorb the costs because they have got the capacity to negotiate better. When you have got a large universe of people that you are trying to cover, you can have more strength in negotiations. It gives you a better hand. The problem we have with small businesses is they do not have the capacity to pool together, to negotiate on behalf of a lot of people. And that is why I am a strong supporter of what is called association health plans that will allow small businesses to pool risk and have a better negotiation policy with those who offer insurance. Congress needs to pass this piece of legislation. It is good for the entrepreneurs of Arkansas. Lower income Americans should be helped with health care by refundable tax credits. It is been a part of my budget. It is an important reform. It will help with the issue of the uninsured. People with health savings accounts, when they buy high deductible insurance policies to protect them against catastrophic medical costs or hospitalization or major surgery, should be allowed to deduct those premiums. See, that will help with the rising costs of health care as well. Those are some practical suggestions for Congress to look at, ways to strengthen the private delivery of medicine as opposed to strengthening the Government involvement in medicine. There is something else we can do at the Federal level, and that is to promote promising health information technology. The truth of the matter is, medicine is on the leading edge of change. And some of the new drugs are fantastic about-to help save lives. Some of the new machinery is fantastic. The information systems of the health care system are a little antiquated. I mean, you are still moving files by hand, are not you? Kind of writing it out by hand.Well, what we need to do is to have standards and computerized records so that we can improve care and prevent errors, which will save money in the system. There is tremendous savings to be had by bringing technology into the medical field, and the Federal Government can help there as well. These are good steps. Yet one of the main cost-drivers, that has nothing to do with what happens in an operating room or a waiting room, happen in the courtroom. One of the reasons people are finding their premiums are up and it is hard to find a doc these days is because frivolous and junk lawsuits are threatening medicine across the country. And there is a lot of them, people just filing these suits. I call them junk suits because they do not have any merit. The problem is they cost money to fight. Every one of these junk suits that people put out there requires the expenditure of money, which affects consumers. That is you. It affects hospitals. That is you as well. In order to avoid protracted litigation, those who provide insurance oftentimes just settle the case. You have got these giant judgments looming out there, people say, Well, I better just go ahead and settle this, rather than risk a bad jury verdict. That drives up costs too. People just filing these lawsuits right and left, and it is running up the costs. Doctors' premiums, the cost of doing business, they are rising. That makes it hard on the docs. It makes it hard on docs to do what they are called to do, which is to heal lives. Medical liability premiums for Arkansas doctors rose more than 150 percent last year. That makes it awfully hard for doctors to do business. And what is their business? Their business is seeing patients. Their business is helping to make somebody's life better. Yet these lawsuits are making it hard for docs to practice their business in the State of Arkansas and other States as well. You see, the costs get passed on. They get passed on to patients or their employers. One of the major cost-drivers in the delivery of health care are these junk and frivolous lawsuits. The risk of frivolous litigation drives doctors-and hear me out on this-they drive doctors to prescribe drugs and procedures that may not be necessary, just to avoid lawsuits. That is called the defensive practice of medicine. According to a survey of the Arkansas Medical Society, 90 percent of Arkansas doctors say the fear of lawsuits have caused them to do unnecessary procedures. See, lawsuits not only drive up premiums, which drives up the cost to the patient or the employer of the patient, but lawsuits cause docs to practice medicine in an expensive way in order to protect themselves in the courthouse. The defensive practice of medicine affects the Federal budget. The direct cost of liability insurance and the indirect cost from unnecessary medical procedures raise the Federal Government's health care costs by at least $28 billion a year. Remember, we provide-at the Federal level, we provide health care through Medicare and Medicaid and veteran's health and Government employee costs. The defensive-the cost of defensive medicine raises your bill as a taxpayer. Not only does it make it harder to go see a doc, it also costs you more as a taxpayer. Medical liability reform is a national issue because medical liability lawsuits raise the Federal budget. It is a national issue that requires a national solution. You need to get your Governor-I know he is strongly, and the Lieutenant Governor is strongly in favor of liability reform-you need to work it here in Arkansas, by the way. Just do not rely upon the Federal Government, but get you good medical liability. It is tough, because some of these lawyer groups are some of the politically strongest groups in the State and the country. I understand how tough it is. But we are doing the right thing by insisting upon medical liability reform. We are doing the right thing by telling people the truth, and that is the health care system looks like a giant lottery. That is what it looks like these days because of these lawsuits. And somehow, the trial lawyers always hold the winning ticket. Lawyers walk away with up to 40 percent- 40 percent-of every settlement and verdict, which adds up to billions of costs, billions of unnecessary costs. Lawsuits do not heal patients. That is a fact. And they are driving a wedge between the docs and their patients. One of the most vital links of good medicine is the doctor-patient relationship. Yet many doctors fear what they tell a patient will be used against them in a court of law. We have got a culture of lawsuit here in America, a culture of lawsuits, a litigation culture, which is driving a wedge between the doctors and patients, and that is not right. When docs treat their patients, the only thing they should worry about is the health of their patients, not some trial lawyer breathing down their neck. Seventy-one percent of the doctors in Arkansas say they are considering early retirement. Let me tell you what is happening here in Arkansas, and it is happening in other States too. You are not alone. These frivolous and junk lawsuits are not only driving up the costs, but a lot of docs are thinking about quitting the practice of medicine. Remember, I talked about to make sure medicine is affordable and available. Lawsuits drive up the affordability. Lawsuits are driving docs out of the practice, which means there is less availability. You have got to have doctors in your communities. In order to be a vibrant, successful community, you need a viable health care industry with good docs. And yet, 71 percent of the doctors in this State say they are considering early retirement; 50 percent of the physicians say they are having difficulty recruiting new doctors to practice in Arkansas. This litigation culture puts a sign up there saying, If you come to our State, you are likely to get sued. Who wants to do that? People want to practice medicine. They do not want to spend their time defending themselves in the courthouse because of the frivolous and junk lawsuits that are too prevalent today in America. More than a third of the docs are considering moving out of State. See, that says to me you got a problem here in Arkansas. And by the way, again I repeat, you are not alone. Trust me, you are not alone. There is a lot of States that cannot get good medical liability reform through. Today I met with some decent docs and health administrators. Let me tell you their stories so that we get a better feel for why we need medical liability reform at the State and Federal level. Sara McBee is here. There is Sara. She is from Fayetteville, Arkansas. She practices family medicine. She was delivering between 80 and 100 babies a year. Now, there is a soul-a good soul who loves life to the point where she is willing to take her talents and deliver babies. It must be an unbelievably satisfying profession to bring life to be. And yet, in July of 2002, her insurance premiums more than doubled. See, the litigation culture made it nearly impossible for her to practice her love. I say nearly impossible, because she would not break her commitments to expecting patients and hung in there for a year. But her premiums continued to rise, and Dr. McBee has stopped delivering babies, as a direct result of too many junk lawsuits, and that is not right. That is not right. Let me give you another story. Dr. John Wilson is with us. Dr. Wilson is a good soul. He is an orthopedist from Little Rock, Arkansas. He is been practicing medicine for-I think he said 35 years, 30 of which he was not hassled by lawsuits. In other words, what we are talking about is a new phenomenon here in society-in this society. He is a-he believes that doctors are called to serve. Besides just healing people, they are called to serve people. And I bet you when you talk to most docs, that is the way they feel as well. So he traveled every week to the Arkansas Delta. And for people who are not familiar with Arkansas, that is a poor, rural area that, frankly, does not have enough doctors. And he heard a calling. So he would go there to help-to love, really, if you think about it-to practice his talent and skills and to love people by helping them, and then he got sued. And the lawsuits were dropped, but he was unable to find insurance because he was told if he kept going over there, the cost of his business, the cost of being a doctor, would rise dramatically. And so he quit going. He quit going. By the way, I went to Mississippi a while ago and talked to a doc who was there in the Mississippi Delta. He came down from another State to practice medicine. He understood there is a lot of poor people there; he wanted to help them. He got sued-for helping poor people, because he is a doctor. And guess what? He left. The Wilson story and the story I just mentioned to you, it is just all too common. And people get affected. These junk lawsuits not only are running up the cost of medicine; they are making the quality of life of some of our citizens-diminishing the quality of life. Sully and Mary Ligon are with us. They are from Helena-or Henrietta? Mrs. Ligon. It is Helena. The President. Helena, yes, Helena. How quickly we forget. Anyway, see, the Ligons got help from Dr. Wilson. She was telling me she got injured during one Christmas and tore a rotator cuff, and Dr. Wilson being the good doc he is, fixed it. Her fastball is back up to about 85 miles an hour now. But Dr. Wilson no longer goes there. And Sully got knocked over by a cow. He said a wild cow, not a mad cow. He got hurt, see. And Dr. Wilson was their doc because he used to go there. He no longer goes there. So guess what? The Ligons now have to drive here. And as they were quick to point out, they can afford to do so, which is good. It is inconvenient as heck, but they can afford to do so. There is a lot of people there that cannot , and they are missing out on a good doc. And the reason Dr. Wilson is not there is because lawsuits are running up the cost of medicine, make it hard for him to practice. His heart's right. Trust me. I heard him. But he just cannot go there. There is just too many junk and frivolous lawsuits. We need to do something about it for the sake of a lot of people. I met with Frank Wise. He is from Fulton County Hospital. It is a rural hospital. These junk lawsuits have raised the cost of delivering babies such that they no longer do so in his hospital. And he tells the story about people desperately looking for a place to- for a bed, and babies being delivered on a bridge. Listen, I am going to tell you something. We can have balance in our society when it comes to having a good legal system and a good medical system. It is not that way today. The pendulum has swung way, way too far. D'Borai Lynn Cook-you might have heard of her if you work here. She is the emergency room case manager. She sees firsthand what it means to practice medicine defensively. She says they over-prescribe to cover themselves to make sure that, as they do their job, they are thinking about what would happen if they end up in a court of law. She says that-she said then there is the negative aspect of defensive medicine with people saying, I am not going to handle that case. See, too many lawsuits affect the lives of a lot of good people, and we need to do something about it. And so I proposed to the Congress to act. My job as the President, if I see problems, is to address them square on, and I expect Congress to do the same thing. I expect Congress to do the same. First of all, we want to make sure the court system is uncluttered. We want to make sure that if a person is injured, they have their day in court. Frivolous and junk lawsuits make it hard for those who get injured to have their day in court, for starters. And secondly, obviously, if they have been hurt by a bad doc, there needs to be a judgment, and that person needs to be able to recover the cost of their care, the recovery, and the economic losses for the rest of their life. Every good doc wants to make sure that the legal system works fairly. Good docs are not afraid to stand up in a court of law. They just do not want to be run out of business because of these junk lawsuits, just filing suit after suit after suit. People ought to be allowed to recover economic damages. But for the sake of a strong health care system, for the sake of making sure health care is accessible and affordable, we need a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages. States that have got a hard cap have seen positive results, have seen the judicial system work well and the medical field stay vibrant. And if harm is caused by truly egregious behavior, patients should be able to recover reasonable punitive damages. What I propose is fair, see. I have laid out something that is balanced and fair, something that addresses a critical national need, and that is the cost of medicine. The problem is, is that some in the United States Senate do not see it that way. That bill I put up there passed the House of Representatives, and it is stuck in the Senate. And your Senators need to hear from you about a balanced, fair system. For the sake of Arkansas and States around the country, you need medical liability reform. We need to make sure we have got joint and several liability reform as well. See, what happens is some of these junk lawsuits, they will just file against everybody. Even though they may not be like 100-percent responsible for an issue, they will have to pay 100 percent of the cost. That is not fair. That hurts hospitals in particular and a lot of docs as well. There needs to be good reform. There just needs to be good, sound national reform that is fair and balanced and full of common sense. The House passed a bill. It is stuck in the Senate. These Senators have got to understand no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit. And I am going to stay on the issue until we get it fixed. This is a national problem. Let me talk about one other issue, and then I will let you get back to work. Today I met Mary Lynn Roberson at the airport. Mary Lynn has volunteered-she is right there. I told her I was going to say her name. Thank you, Mary Lynn. She has volunteered here for nearly three decades. She visits with family and friends of surgery patients. In other words, she is spreading love, is what she is doing. And the reason I bring that up, and her work, is because the true strength of America is the fact that there are Mary Lynns in every community who are willing to take time out of their personal life to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. We are a mighty nation when it comes to our military, and we will keep it that way. We are a mighty nation when it comes to wealth in our economy, and it is getting better. But the most mighty aspect of our Nation is the fact that our citizens, from all walks of life, care deeply about a neighbor in need. One of the most compelling things about being the President is I get to see on a daily basis the true compassion of our fellow citizens. And I hear just unbelievably fantastic stories about people overcoming big odds, because a neighbor is helped. Somebody has just taken time out of their life to make a difference. My call to the good people of Little Rock is to work with the Boy Scouts-and I thank you for being involved in such a values-based program-or to start a program in your house of worship to feed the hungry or find shelter for the homeless. If you are interested in helping make a difference, mentor a child, teach a child how to read. What a fantastic gift that is to teach a child to read. After all, I like to say reading is the new civil right. And you can help. The strength of this country is the fact that we are a compassionate country. And there are thousands of people who are soldiers in the army of compassion, working hard to change lives, just like you are doing here at this hospital. I am so grateful that you gave me a chance to come by and talk about issues of national concern. I am particularly grateful for the love you show for people who hurt here in society. This country is a great country because it is full of great people. I am honored to be here. May God bless your work, and may God continue to bless America.

{"id": 942, "text": "To Congressman Keller, to Rob and all the hardworking men and women of Kuharchik Construction. The neighbors and friends from across Pennsylvania, it is great to be back in the Keystone State with workers for Trump. I am so grateful y'all came out on a beautiful day, the first day of September as we start the road to victory on November 3. It really is great to be here with so many friends who've supported this president and our administration from day one. Would you join me in thanking someone who has been a fighter for this administration? He has stood strong for an agenda that made America great again in our first three years and seen this state and nation through trying time, Congressman Fred Keller, thank you for your great leadership in the House of Representatives and for America. It is also great to be here with two future members of Congress who I know are going to stand with this president and our agenda for four more years. Join me in thanking Lisa Scheller and Jim Bognet. Pennsylvania needs to send them to Washington, D.C. It really is great to be with all of you. You can take a seat if you got one, because I am here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Pennsylvania and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. It is on, Pennsylvania. It is on and I am so excited to be back with all of you. We had a busy week last week. How about that Republican National Convention? Did you check some of that out? I mean come Thursday night, President Trump laid out an inspiring vision, an inspiring vision for our second term, a vision of more jobs, better wages, more support for our heroes and that night the president said that voters have never faced a clearer choice. This election, as he said, will decide whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny or whether we save the American dream. Standing here in Pennsylvania, I know we are going to vote for America, we are going to vote for four more years for President Donald Trump in the White House. You know I know we are not too far from our opponent's boyhood home, but it is Trump country now. I am here because I stand with President Donald Trump. When this president stands up for faith and family and the American flag, I stand with President Donald Trump. When this president stands up to the radical left and their socialist agenda, I stand with President Donald Trump and when this president stands up for American workers and jobs, jobs, jobs, we stand with President Donald Trump. Four years ago a movement was born and judging from this crowd and everybody I saw on the way here, it looks like that movement's doing just fine in Pennsylvania. It was a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Pennsylvania, you believed we could be strong again. You believed we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016 and I know that Pennsylvania's going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020. I mean look how far we have come. Four years ago we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values, the freedom of religion and the right to life, and in four short years, we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy and we are once again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and space force the resources and support they need to defend this nation. We revived our economy. We cut taxes across the board, rolled back federal red tape, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade. We stood for all of our God-given liberties, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the unalienable right to life. This president stood for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and we always will. We appointed conservatives, more than 200 conservatives at every level including two great Supreme Court justices and every single day, this president and this administration have stood with the men and women of law enforcement all across America. Today, the president is visiting Wisconsin to show support for the people of Kenosha who've been through a lot in the last week. He went there to show support for law enforcement for the National Guard, and President Donald Trump is in Kenosha today to make it clear that we stand for law and order in every city and every town for every American. I saw Joe Biden was in Pennsylvania yesterday. Did you see it? After months of staying silent on riots and looting and violence in the streets of our cities, Joe Biden finally came out of his basement and he actually said we have to stand against violence in every form it takes. Right after that, he criticized law enforcement and he never mentioned any of the anarchists or left wing mobs that have been sewing violence in the streets of our major cities. Joe Biden said yesterday he does not think he looks like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters. But men and women of Pennsylvania, you should know, yesterday Joe Biden never condemned ANTIFA. He never called on Democrat mayors to get their cities under control. He never called out his campaign staff or his running mate for raising money to bail out violent criminals. Joe Biden never even offered a plan to end the violence. For months all he is talked about is peaceful protesters as the American people have watched businesses and communities in our major cities burn. It is been heartbreaking to watch. The truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in America's cities. I think you all know you will not be safe in Joe Biden's America. Now President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see a - Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down in our streets. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color so help us God. And I think the people of Pennsylvania know despite what the many leaders in the democratic party have to say, many voices in the media and those on the radical level, we do not have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, their education, their jobs, and safety. From the first day of this administration we have done both and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African American and minority communities across this land for four more years. Joe Biden says America is systemically racist and that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. And when asked whether he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement Joe Biden replied, Yes, absolutely. But under President Donald Trump I will make you a promise, we will always stand with those who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement. We are not going to defund the police not now, not ever. So, under President Trump's leadership we have stood for a stronger and safer America. We stood up for all of our liberties, we have revived our economy. And in those first three years businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs including 500,000 manufacturing jobs. Pennsylvania and Indiana. I have a lot in common. I always used to say back when I was governor of the hoosier state that we did two things well, we make things and we grow things but the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. The last president with his vice president Joe Biden actually said in the summer of 2016 he was asked about manufacturing jobs he says, I do not know what you are going to do to bring them back. He said, What magic wand do you have? Well, the people of Pennsylvania knew we did not need a magic wand we just needed President Donald Trump in the white house, 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in the first three years. In three short years with your support we created the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again. And then the Corona virus struck from China but before the first case of Corona virus spread person to person within the United States our president took the unprecedented action of suspending all travel from China. And I promise you that action saved untold American lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. At the president's direction we marshaled the full resources of the federal government and the American economy. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing. We produced billions of supplies distributed to our great doctors and nurses and hospital workers around the country. And as we speak we are developing a growing number of treatments that are saving lives across America. And even though Joe Biden said that, No miracle is coming, I have got news for you. We are on track to have the world's first safe and effective Corona virus vaccine by the end of the year. America is the land of miracles. Now that said, I want to be clear. Our hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones during the course of this pandemic including the more than 7,000 families here in the keystone state. Know that you have always been in our hearts and you will remain in our prayers. But thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers, we are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives and we are opening up America again. In the days ahead I promise you we are going to continue to put the health of America first. As we work to bring this economy all the way back we all have a role to play but we all have a choice to make. Because of the strong foundation that President Trump and the congressmen and our allies in Washington DC helped us to pour it is amazing to think we have already seen nine million Americans go back to work in the last three months alone including more than 500,000 jobs right here in Pennsylvania. And just this morning we saw the manufacturing, the backbone of the American economy actually expanded at the highest rate since November of 2018. Men and women of Pennsylvania, because of the strong foundation on which we are standing the great American comeback is happening. But you need to ask yourself and ask your neighbors to come November 3rd. As our economy is beginning to stand back up, as we are putting millions of Americans back to work, you need to ask yourself who do you trust to rebuild this economy. A career politician who presided over the slowest recovery since the great depression or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world. The choice is clear to bring America all the way back we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the white house. So, we have been going through a time of testing. As I said just the other night we are soon coming to a time for choosing and on safety and security jobs and values the choice could not be more clear. I mean think about it, in the middle of a global pandemic Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars. President Trump, well we cut taxes across the board for working families, businesses large and small and we are going to cut taxes again in the next four years. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape like his own version of the green new deal. President Trump he actually signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any president in American history and we are going to keep chopping for four more years. Joe Biden, he wants to go back to economic surrender with China. He actually said he would repeal all the tariffs that the president put into place that have been leveling the playing field for American workers. President Trump, he stood up to China. He put American jobs and American workers first and we are going to stand strong until we level the playing field once and for all. Also on trade Joe Biden voted for NAFTA, we all know what that did to this economy. But thanks to President Donald Trump NAFTA is yesterday and the USMCA is here to stay. It is a win for American jobs. The experts tell us the USMCA could create up to 600,000 new jobs including 50,000 manufacturing jobs, it is incredible. And where President Donald Trump ended the war on coal, unleashed American energy and we are now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Joe Biden and the radical left want to crush American energy, crush American energy jobs, and raise the cost of electricity for every household and business in Pennsylvania. But yesterday Joe Biden actually went to Pittsburgh and after months of campaigning on a plan to abolish fossil fuels he said, I am not He said, I am not banning fracking. In fact, he said it twice. And then he said President Trump was lying about his record. So let me set the record straight. When Joe Biden was asked last July and I quote, Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? Joe Biden said, quote, No, we would walk it out. Here in Pennsylvania where ending fracking would literally cost a half a million jobs by some estimates, you deserve to know, that when Joe Biden was asked whether he'd be willing to quote, Sacrifice thousands or hundreds of thousands of blue collar jobs for the sake of a radical environmental agenda, Joe Biden said, quote, The answer's yes. And this time last year he told a supporter and I quote, I guarantee, I guarantee we are going to end fossil fuels. Joe, that includes fracking. I mean, what Joe does not know is America's future depends on energy independence. So let me tell all the great workers gathered here at Workers for Trump, whatever you may hear over every day that remains between now and election day, Joe Biden and the radical left are going to try to ban fracking and abolish fossil fuels, but we are not going to let it happen. I guarantee, I guarantee with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, we will have more fracking, more American energy, and energy independence for generations to come. So it is been about prosperity and security, but it is also about recognizing that we have a president that knows that if you do not have a border, you do not have a nation. And Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Donald Trump has stood by the men and women of customs and border protection. We have made historic investments in border security, and we have already built more than 300 miles of that border wall on the Southern border of the United States. And with four more years, we are going to build it all. And finally, beyond security and safety and prosperity, it is also about values in this election. For years, Joe Biden took the position that while he supported abortion rights, he did not support using taxpayer funds to pay for abortion. But now Joe Biden supports using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. I could not be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history. And it is not just been about life, it is been about liberty, and this president has stood strong for the freedom of religion of every American of every faith, and we always will. President Donald Trump in our first year, ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor and the supreme court of the United States made it permanent. Joe Biden, he actually said that he would work to reimpose the Obamacare mandates on those wonderful nuns, but we are not going to let it happen. You know, the choice in this election has never been clear. The stakes have never been higher. When you look at that agenda, it is clear, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for an agenda of the radical left. A couple of weeks back, Joe Biden said that democracy was on the ballot, but I think you all know that our economy is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but there are also things much more fundamental and foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. I think in this election, it is not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, whether it will be more republican or more democrat, more red or blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America. Whether we are going to chart a course grounded in our highest ideals of freedom and free markets, the unalienable right to life and liberty, or whether we are going to change course as a nation and fundamentally transform our country and our economy into something entirely different. President Donald Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity, and Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline. Men and women, I came to Pennsylvania today because we stand at a crossroads. Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left. Many of you may have described and identified yourself as democrats in the past. You may still today, but y'all deserve to know this is not your father's or your mother's Democratic Party. The truth is Democratic Party today is about higher taxes, socialized medicine, open borders, abortion on demand and cutting funding to law enforcement. It would take our nation on a path of socialism and decline. And so I say to all my fellow republicans, all our independents, and every great democrat gathered here, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden is never going to be president of the United States. We are going to reelect president Donald Trump for four more years. Because for all we have done in those first three years, for all we have done through the trying days of 2020, that is just what President Donald Trump calls a good start. We are going to keep America going, keep America growing. And with four more years, I promise you, four more years means more jobs. For more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops, and it is going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp. So ladies and gentlemen, it is on, and it is time. And President Donald Trump, I think you all figured out a while ago, President Donald Trump is a real deal. He is a man who says what he means, and means what he says. Never quits. He never backs down. Now I can tell you firsthand, he is never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of Pennsylvania, now it is our turn to fight for him. So I need you to bring it. Bring all your enthusiasts. Talk to your neighbors and friends in every day between now and election day. And when you get out there, have faith. Have faith that even in these divided times that every time the American people have been presented a choice between a future of more freedom or a future of less freedom, the American people choose freedom every time. So have faith in your neighbors and friends, speak to them. At work, at worship. Tell them I was over at the construction company, I ran into Mike. He talked for like a half hour, just like giving a summary. He said, he talked for like a half hour, just like giving a summary of everything we got done under this president, everything we have been able to do for the American people. So go talk to your neighbors and friends and be confident. I'd also encourage you to have that other kind of faith. It seems as you turn on the television these days, it seems like there is more that divides this country than any time in my lifetime but I will always believe, and I believe it more having traveled across this country as your vice president, that there is always be more that unites the American people than could ever divide us and chief among those things is faith. This is a nation effect. So I want to say to you, if you are inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I encourage you to do that too. And on this one, I am not asking for support for a candidate or a cause or a party. I am just thinking about our country and I am thinking about that ancient promise that if his people, who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, he will do like he is always done through the long and storied history of this country. He will hear from heaven and he will heal this land. This one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. Pray for all the American people. It will make a difference. So I thank you for coming out today. I leave here today with renewed confidence that with your continued support and energy and your prayers, between now and November 3rd, that we are going to lead a great American comeback. We are going to have a great victory for the American people and for America, herself. We are going to make Pennsylvania and America stronger and more prosperous than ever before and I just know, when we re-elect Congressman Keller to the House of Representatives, when we send Lisa Scheller and Jim Bognet to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, we re-elect principled Republican leaders at every level, all across this country and when we re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years, we will make America great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless Pennsylvania and God Bless America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmikepenceworkersfortrumpeventspeechtranscriptseptember1", "title": "Mike Pence 'Workers for Trump' Event Speech Transcript September 1", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mike-pence-workers-for-trump-event-speech-transcript-september-1", "publication_date": "01-09-2020", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Mike Pence"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 946, "text": "I want to pick up her speech because I think I can sell it for a lot of money. Here, Juanita. Ah. You are going to see that tonight. Right? Thank you very much, Juanita. You have been fantastic, and your kind words. This is truly an incredible organization. Thanks also to the members of NFIB's Board of Directors who I have spent time with. Just took some wonderful pictures with good-looking group, I have to tell you. And Board Chairman Steve Schramm. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Together, you have been a powerful voice for America's small businesses. And now you have a true friend and ally in the White House. You know that. You know that. I am honored to be with you today for, really, this historic celebration. This was something when they asked me to do, I did not think about it for more than about a second. I said, I will do it. You are very special people. And let me officially say, on behalf of the American people, happy 75th anniversary to the National Federation of Independent Business. I tell you, you deserve a big happy. Joining us today are some terrific people who work very, very hard. And actually, they are starting to get a lot of credit. In fact, we had our highest poll numbers today. Can you believe this? So they are doing a good job. Our highest. You know the old story when I was campaigning, I only mentioned that when we were doing well in the polls. When we are not doing well, I do not talk about it. Like all of you. You do the same thing. Secretary Mnuchin. Steve, thank you very much. Doing a great job. Secretary Acosta. Alex. And Administrator Linda McMahon. Thank you, Linda. Thank you. They are fighting hard for small business and for large business. They are fighting hard for our country, frankly, each and every day. And they are doing a terrific job. Most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the small business owners, who are the engine of American prosperity. And, you know, I have been saying it for a long time, but you really are. You look at even the stats and you look at the numbers. You look at the taxes that are paid. You look at the jobs. It is all about small business. So small businesses, really I say this to Linda McMahon all the time head of Small Business. But small business is really big. Right, Linda? It is really big. For many years, Washington tried to hold you back and tear you down, crushing the American small business with crippling taxes and oppressive regulation. But all that has changed starting in November 2016. The Trump administration is with you, and we are with you 100 percent. And always will be. Instead of punishing entrepreneurship, we are now promoting entrepreneurship. Especially that guy in the corner. Main Street is thriving and America is winning once again. You know, we are respected again. This country is respected again. Before going any further today, I want to take a moment to address something you have been reading a lot about: the illegal immigration crisis on our southern border. It is been going on for many, many decades and many years. And it has its ups and its downs. And all we need is good legislation, and we can have it taken care of. And we have to get the Democrats to go ahead and work with us. Because as a result of Democrat-supported loopholes in our federal laws, most illegal immigrant families and minors from Central America who arrive unlawfully at the border cannot be detained together or removed together, only released. These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we do not want. As a result of these loopholes, roughly half a million illegal immigrant family units and minors from Central America have been released into the United States since 2014 at unbelievably great taxpayer expense. Nobody knows how much we are paying for this monstrosity that is been created over the years legislation that nobody has any idea what they are doing. They do not even know what it means. And you have to see this; it is a mile high. Child smugglers exploit the loopholes, and they gain illegal entry into the United States, putting countless children in danger on the perilous trek to the United States. They come up through Mexico. Mexico does nothing for us. You hear it here: They do nothing for us. They could stop it. They have very, very strong laws. Try staying in Mexico for a couple of days. See how long that lasts. Okay? They do nothing for us, and I see it through NAFTA. I see with $100 billion-plus that they make on trade through NAFTA one of the worst deals ever made by this country. A disaster. And we are trying to equalize it. And it is not easy, but we are getting there. It is not easy. And we are going to take care of our American farmers, and we are going to take care of our manufacturers, and our manufacturing jobs. But they are making unbelievable amounts of money, and that is not including the drugs that are flowing through our border, because we have no wall and we have no protection. The drugs that are coming in from Mexico and through the southern border is disgraceful. So we will see whether or not we can make a reasonable NAFTA deal or deal does not have to be called NAFTA. We can do one-on-one with Mexico; one-on-one with Canada. And, by the way, Canada they like to talk. They are our great neighbor. They fought World War II with us. We appreciate it. They fought World War I with us. And we appreciate it, but we are protecting each other. There was a story two days ago, in a major newspaper, talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States, and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive. The tariffs to get common items back into Canada are so high that they have to smuggle them in. They buy shoes, then they wear them. They scuff them up. They make them sound old or look old. No, we are treated horribly. Dairy. Dairy. Two-hundred and seventy-five percent tariff. So basically that is a barrier without saying it is a barrier. And I told them, if they do not change their ways and we have a tremendous deficit. People say, Well, there is really not that much of a deficit. Well, they are not including two things: energy and timber. And those are the two big things when it comes to Canada. No, we have to change our ways. We can no longer be the stupid country. We want to be the smart country. So hopefully, we will be able to work it out with Canada. We have very good relationships with Canada. We have for a long time. And hopefully, that will work out. But Canada is not going to take advantage of the United States any longer, and Mexico is not going to take advantage of the United States any longer. And when I campaigned, I said I will either renegotiate NAFTA or I will terminate it and we will start from an even base. And people are afraid of that. You know, I have had so many people they come up, they say, Oh, please do not terminate NAFTA. I said, But it is no good. Yeah, but we know what we have. It is true. People are worried because they know what they have. If you look at I love the American farmer more than anybody. They have backed me. I love the American farmer. And by the way I will tell you in a little while because it is in one of my notes the American farmer virtually will not have to pay any more estate tax on their farms when they pass away and they want to leave it to their children. And that goes for almost all small businesses. You will not have the estate tax to pay anymore, which was crippling. That was in our bill. See? A young guy is standing. Now, he is too young to be leaving it, so that means he is a beneficiary. I do not know. Do not act to happy. There is a wealthy father there. Do not act too happy. Is that your father? Oh, wow. The answer is yes. Okay. And you know what? You are both happy. Okay? You are both happy. And I am honored to have done it, because it was destroying the estate tax small businesses and farms. Destroying them. People were mortgaging them to the hilt to pay the tax, and then they could not pay the interest on the mortgage, and the banks would take them away. You do not have to pay the estate tax any longer. In most cases. In other words, loopholes if your farm is really big, you start to pay. It is a pretty big level, you know that. Pretty big. That would have to be a pretty big farm. These loopholes have created a massive child smuggling trade. Can you believe this? In this day and age, we are talking about child smuggling. We are talking about women smuggling in this day and age. The worst it is been in history because the Internet has led to this. You think back 200, 500, 1,000 years ago the worst it is ever been. Women smuggling, child smuggling. Since last year, child smugglers who are very, very sophisticated they have learned the loopholes in this horrible, rotten system that the Democrats have to help us fix because we need the votes. We could have the Republican votes, 100 percent. We still do not have enough votes. People do not understand that. We need Democrat votes to get it fixed. These smugglers know these rules and regulations better than the people that drew them. As a result, there is been a 325 percent increase in minors, and a 435 percent increase in the smuggling or attempted smuggling of families and minors into our country. We are stopping them all the time by the thousands. But they still get through. We have no wall. We have no border security. Without a border, you do not have a country. You do not have a country. Under current law, we have only two policy options to respond to this massive crisis: We can either release all illegal immigrant families and minors who show up at the border from Central America, or we can arrest the adults for the federal crime of illegal entry. Those are the only two options. Totally open borders or criminal prosecution for law breaking. And you want to be able to do that. We do not want people pouring into our country. We want them to come in through the process, through the legal system. And we want, ultimately, a merit-based system where people come in based on merit. Keep in mind, those who apply for asylum, legally, at ports of entry, are not prosecuted. The fake news media back there does not talk about that. They are fake. They are helping they are helping these smugglers and these traffickers like nobody would believe. They know it. They know exactly what they are doing and it should be stopped because what is going on is very unfair to the people of our country. And they violate the law. People that come in violate the law. They endanger their children in the process. And frankly, they endanger all of our children. You see what happens with MS-13, where your sons and daughters are attacked violently. Kids that never even heard of such a thing are being attacked violently, not with guns, but with knives because it is much more painful. Inconceivable here we are talking about business inconceivable that we even have to talk about MS-13 and other gangs. They attack violently, the most painful way possible. And a bullet is too quick. And we are allowing these people into our country? Not with me. We are taking them out by the thousands. We are taking them out by the thousands. So what I am asking Congress to do is to give us a third option, which we have been requesting since last year the legal authority to detain and promptly remove families together as a unit. We have to be able to do this. This is the only solution to the border crisis. We have to stop child smuggling. This is the way to do it. And ultimately, we have to have a real border not judges. Thousands and thousands of judges they want to hire. Who are these people? When we vet a single federal judge, it goes through a big process. Everybody that is ever met her or him they come, they complain, they do not complain. They say he is brilliant; she is brilliant; he is not smart enough to be a judge. Now we are hiring thousands and thousands. What country does this? Judges. I will not say it. I refuse to say it. I hope they picked that up back there. They will not . No, what seriously, what country does it? They said, Sir, we'd like to hire about five or six-thousand more judges. Five or six-thousand? Now, can you imagine the graft that must take place? You are all small business owners, so I know you can imagine a thing like that would happen. But here is a guy they say, Could you please be a judge? Come on, get it. They line up to be a judge. It is horrible. We do not want judges; we want security on the border. We do not want people coming in. We want them to come in through a legal process like everybody else that is waiting to come into our country. And it got so crazy that all of these thousands we now have thousands of judges border judges thousands and thousands. And, by the way, when we release the people they never come back to the judge anyway. They are gone. They are in your system. That is it. If they are good, that is great. And if they are bad, you will have killings, you will have murders, you will have this, you will have that, and you will have crime. You will have crime. And remember, these countries that we give tremendous foreign aid to in many cases, they send these people up and they are not sending their finest. Does that sound familiar? Remember I made that speech and I was badly criticized? Oh it is so terrible, what he said. Turned out I was 100 percent right. That is why I got elected. We want a great country. We want a country with heart. But when people come up, they have to know they cannot get in, otherwise it is never going to stop. Whether it was President Bush, President Obama, President Clinton same policies. They cannot get them changed because both sides are always fighting. This is maybe a great chance to have a change. But one of them says we want to hire 5,000 more judges. I do not want judges. I want border security. I do not want to try people. I do not want people coming in. Do you know, if a person comes in and puts one foot on our ground, it is essentially welcome to America, welcome to our country. You never get them out, because they take their name, they bring the name down, they file it, then they let the person go; they say show back up to court in one year from now. One year. But here is the thing: That in itself is ridiculous. Like 3 percent come back. The other thing they have is they have professional lawyers. Some are for good, others are do-gooders, and others are bad people. And they tell these people exactly what to say. They say, Say the following: they write it down I am being harmed in my country. My country is extremely dangerous. I fear for my life. Say that. Congratulations. You will never be removed. This is given to them by lawyers who are waiting for them to come up. And they are not all bad people. They are impractical people. But, in a way, that is cheating because they are giving them statements. They are not coming up for that reason. They are coming up for many other reasons and sometimes for that reason. There is been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years. Think of that. Think of that. We are a great country but you cannot do that. Smugglers know how the system works. They game the system; they game it. It is so easy for them. They are smart. They did not go to the Wharton School of Finance. But you know what? They are really smart. The United States has just surpassed Germany as having the most asylum seekers of any nation on Earth. Can you image that? Can you image? And Germany we talk about Germany they allowed millions of people in. And, by the way, their crime, from the time they started, is up more than 10 percent. And that is one of the reasons it is at that level is because they do not like reporting that kind of crime, so they put it down as different kind of crime. But their crime is up more than 10 percent since they started taking them in. I heard somebody said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was questioning that statistic. She said, It is not true. It is not true. Did not she already have her chance? I mean, I have . I will tell you what, when you read the IG report with these really dishonest people and I was never a deep-state guy, but let me tell you, we got some bad people that are doing bad things. But when you read that IG report about how she got away with what she got away with, it is a disgrace. It is a total disgrace. And you ought to see the hearings that are right now on television but that folks are being you know, they are going on to the mainstream, fake news media. They want to focus on immigration because they want to keep the cameras away from the hearings because those hearings are not good for them. In fact, they are a disaster for them. The whole thing is a scam. It is a scam. And what is happened is a disgrace. So we have a House that is getting ready to finalize an immigration package that they are going to brief me on later, and that I am going to make changes to. We have one chance to get it right. We might as well get it right, or let us just keep it going. But let us do it right. We have a chance. We want to solve this problem. We want to solve family separation. I do not want children taken away from parents. And when you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away. Now, we do not have to prosecute them. But then we are not prosecuting them for coming in illegally. That is not good. We want to end the border crisis by finally giving us the legal authorities and the resources to detain and remove illegal immigrant families all together and bring them back to their country. We have to bring them back to their country. Now, think of all that aid that we give some of these countries. Hundreds of millions of dollars we give to some of these countries, and they send them up. Well, I am going to go, very shortly, for authorization that when countries abuse us by sending their people up not their best we are not going to give any more aid to those countries. Why the hell should we? Why should we? So this is a responsible, commonsense approach that all lawmakers should embrace Democrats and Republicans. And remember, we need the Democrats. People say, Oh, you have the majority. Well, in the Senate, we have 1, but you need 60. So we will be at if we get 100 percent, we will be at 51. A hundred percent, we will be at 51. So we need nine votes. We need 10, 12, 13 votes. We have to have Democrat support because we need to go not just a majority, unfortunately, which we could get. We need to go to 60 60 out of 100. We need Democrat support. They do not want to give it, because Democrats love open borders. Let the whole world come in. Let the whole world. MS-13 gang members from all over the place, come on in we have open borders. And they view that possibly intelligently, except that it is destroying our country. They view that as potential voters. Someday they are going to vote for Democrats. Because they cannot win on their policies, which are horrible. They found that out in the last presidential election. In fact, their only policy was that Donald Trump is a bad guy, he is a bad person. Vote against Trump. And they said it so many hundreds of millions of dollars of negative ads. Nobody has ever been hit like that. I used to go home I started disliking myself. It is true. I said, Man, am I that bad? The problem is they never told anybody what they are doing. They did not talk about tax cuts. By the way, they want to take away your tax cuts, and they want to substantially increase your taxes. They did not talk about crime. All they talked about was Trump. So when people got to the booth, they said, Ah, we are going to vote Democrat. We are going to vote but then they get up, they said, But what does she stand for? What do they stand for? They just hate Trump. No, I am going with Trump. And that is what happened. We got tremendous Democrat support. It was a beautiful thing. That was a beautiful night. Do you agree? That was a beautiful night. That was some night. That was some night. But you have to stand for something, and you have to stand for safety and security of our country. We cannot let people pour in. They have got to go through the process. And maybe it is politically correct, or maybe it is not. We got to stop separation of the families. But politically correct or not, we have a country that needs security, that needs safety, that has to be protected. So we are here today to talk about small business and the incredible progress we are making as a country. We really have made unbelievable progress. And we are making with the help and support of our wonderful friends at the NFIB. And you have heard these numbers. And if I would have said these numbers during the campaign, the fake news would have said this is the most ridiculous I would not have said these numbers; I would have said half. Who would have known? But things have kicked in better. And as an example, you saw the poll that was recently taken small-business poll. The most optimistic in history, in the history of the poll. That is why I figured that probably this would be a friendly crowd. But nobody would have believed these numbers if I said them during the campaign. We have created more than 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day. 3.4 million. Think of what that means. And, by the way, we do need people coming through the border. We do need people. And again, we want people you know, I have a lot of companies moving in, big companies. If you look at Foxconn in Wisconsin, they are coming in. They need thousands and thousands of people. Chrysler is moving from Mexico back into Michigan. Many car companies are coming back into our country. Many companies are coming back. They are coming back from where they went. Now they are coming because of all of the things we have done with regulations, with tax cutting. But we need people to take care. We have the lowest unemployment rate 3.8 percent. We need people. So we want people to come in, but they have to be people that can help us and can help these companies fulfill what they want to fulfill. Unemployment claims are at a 44-year low. That is a great number. Maybe the one that makes me happiest is this because I remember I'd go around, I'd say, What do you have to lose? Vote for me. The Democrats have always been with you. Vote for me. They have you know, bad education. The most unsafe parts of the country. All of these different I'd say to the African Americans, I'd say, what you have to do What do you have to do? Vote for me. What do you have to lose? Unemployment for African Americans is at the lowest level in history. It is like, what do you have to lose? I would go around and talk, and some people would say, do not say that, it is not nice. I'd say, look, it is true. So badly treated. And now the lowest level of unemployment in history for African Americans. And for Hispanic, the lowest level of unemployment in history. And for women, the lowest level of unemployment in 21 years. Soon it will be history. Just like I promised during the campaign, our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful words words that you probably know better than anybody in this country: jobs, jobs, jobs. And I should not say this to the people in this room, because you will end up not having liked my speech but wages for working people are finally, after 22 years, rising again in our country. I am sorry to do that. It is the only thing you can hold against me, but I think you are also very happy about it, actually. I know you well. According to the NFIB's latest survey, the share of small businesses raising worker and benefit pay has just set a new all-time record. So it is a new all-time record. We have broken many records. I could go on and on. Business optimism is the highest it is ever been in our country. That means more hardworking Americans are able to support their family, contribute to their community, and live the American Dream. At the center of America's resurgence are the massive tax cuts that Republicans passed and that I signed into law six months ago this week. Not one Democrat voted for the tax cuts, and they are suffering now because they are going to lose a lot of races that they thought they were going to win. They wish they had that vote to do over again. We have numerous states for Senate where I think they are going to be in big trouble. It is the biggest tax cut and reform in American history. And you know the story: Not since Ronald Reagan have they done any major tax cutting. And they have wanted to many, many times. I tell this story all the time. I said, I do not understand it. Cutting taxes should not be hard to sell. Right? Is there anything easier? We are going to cut your taxes. And you cannot get it through. So the leadership came to my beautiful Oval Office. It is a beautiful office. Great office. And they talked about the tax reform. I said, What is the word 'reform'? What does that mean, 'reform'? Does that mean you are going to raise taxes? What does it mean? No, sir. We have the Tax Reform Act of 2017. I said, No, I do not want to go 'reform.' Nobody knows what reform means. Then I looked back at all of the times they tried to pass tax cuts. They do not use the word tax cuts; they use the word tax reform. I said, Nobody knows what reform means. They want to know about tax cuts; they do not want to know about tax reform, where we are going to raise your taxes, where we are going to take away your businesses, you are going to take away because tax reform. We are going to take away your farms. They do not want the word reform. They want the word tax cuts. Sir, could you give us a name? I will give you the name. I will give you the name. It is called the Tax Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut Bill of 2017. That is what it is called. Right? That is a true story. Right, Steve? That is such a true story. But even I thought that it was maybe a little bit hokey with all the cuts. So we just called it Tax Cut Bill. Got rid of some of the cuts. They got the word. And we got it passed. But think of it: Not one Democrat vote. At the heart of our plan is tremendous relief for working families and small businesses. A typical family of four earning $75,000 a year will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000 in some cases, much more than that slashing their tax bill in half and more. We delivered a historic victory for American small businesses by allowing you to deduct 20 percent of your business income. People were shocked. Capital investment is soaring on small businesses and big businesses, because you can now immediately deduct this, to me, is the greatest of them all every single penny spent on new capital equipment. One year. Boom. Deduction. I think that is going to be the star. As you know, we are also bringing back trillions of dollars from offshore that we could not bring back. The companies were unable to do it. From a tax standpoint, the amount they had to pay and almost more importantly, it was just very hard to do. You had to see the forms that had to be filled out. It was virtually impossible. So we had anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion, and now it seems as though, Steve, we are hitting the higher side. Companies are pouring money back into our country, bringing it back from overseas, investing it here. Apple just announced recently they are going to spend $350 billion on an incredible campus and new facilities all over the country. They are bringing money back and like nobody ever thought before. And you have heard me say, when they said $350 billion, I said, You mean $350 million. Because $350 million builds a nice plant. I know how to build under budget and ahead of schedule. I can build a beautiful plant for a lot less than $350 million. So when I heard billion, I said, No, no. You mean $350 million, right? They said, No. Think of what that is. I think of the total amount they are bringing back about $230 billion, and the rest they are putting in. Tremendous investment in our country. And ExxonMobil is doing the same thing and so many other countries are doing the same thing, different numbers. It is incredible what is happened. I still say, however, expensing one year expensing will be the star of what we are doing. We exempted more small business owners from the alternative minimum tax, which you know very well was an enormous waste of your precious time and your very hard-earned money. That was a disastrous tax. And from now on, most small-business owners will be spared from the deeply unfair estate tax that I talked about. And it is so I am so proud of that, because you are all keeping your businesses. The family, the farms, you are keeping your businesses. As a result of all of these taxes and all of these tax cuts, American businesses now are on a level playing field with your competitors from other countries who have so many advantages, including subsidy by governments. You see what is happening with China. We have no choice. This should have been done many years ago. We have no choice. China has been taking out $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuilding China. I always say, We have rebuilt China. They have taken so much. It is time, folks. It is time. So we are going to get smart, and we are going to do it right. And we are actually getting a lot of support. But we have to do something about it. Now, maybe something happens where they come and they say, We agree, it is been unfair for the last 25 years. But somehow, that does not seem to work so easily. But we are going and we are going to make it fair. We are going to make it fair with other countries, both our friends and our enemies. And I have to say this: In many cases, our friends, on trade, have treated us much worse than our enemies. Pretty amazing, is not it? But we know that when the rules are fair, and you can compete, you will win against anyone anywhere in the world. There is nobody like you. You are going to win anywhere. But you have to bring it down to a level playing field. More than 6 million workers have already received a bonus some by your people or a pay raise, or retirement account contribution, or a new job thanks to these tax cuts. A lot of new jobs. And people now are able to go around and look for jobs. They are just not taking a job and they hate it. They hate to wake up in the morning. They do not want to go to work. Now they have got their choice. They have jobs that they can look and they can love. And if you do not love it, you are not going to be good at it. Millions of Americans are now saying, and really saying to everybody, that they are saving money on their monthly utility bills. As a result of our business tax cuts, over 100 utility companies have lowered their prices, saving Americans an additional $3 billion a year. Our historic tax cuts also ended one of the most unfair taxes imaginable Obamacare's individual mandate. Government will no longer punish you if you cannot afford Obamacare's sky-high premiums. Think of this: You pay a lot of money to the government in order not to have to buy in health insurance. Think of that. So you are paying money so that you do not that is a penalty. Incredibly, it was allowed. But you are paying money so that you do not have to buy healthcare. That was a beauty. It is over. It is gone. It is done. And we actually thought we had the votes, and then one man, very early in the morning, went thumbs down. So that was that. But we almost got rid of Obamacare without him. And that was a very sad day for the Republican Party. That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast that final vote was cast. A thumbs down. I remember it well. Obamacare has been especially brutal for small businesses. You know that better than anybody. It caused premiums and deductibles to explode, and healthcare options to plummet. As a result of Obamacare, many small businesses, small-business employees, sole proprietors have no good or affordable options. But now they do, because we are opening up our system. I am proud to announce another truly historic step in our efforts to Americans from Obamacare and the Obamacare nightmare, and provide high-quality, affordable healthcare to every American. This is low-cost, great healthcare. You know, before Obamacare, there were many people very happy. They had no problem. But then you got thrown to the wind. Alex Acosta is here. Stand up, Alex. This is so important. This is his baby. Secretary of Labor. Alex and the Department of Labor are taking a major action that is been worked on for four months now and now it is ready to make it easier for small businesses to band together to negotiate lower prices for health insurance and escape some of Obamacare's most burdensome mandates through association health plans. You are going to save massive amounts of money and have much better healthcare. It is going to cost you much less. It is going to be, I think, fantastic. And it is very comprehensive. I will tell you, a lot of people big, big percentages of this country are going to be doing that. In fact, while you are in the room together, shake hands, form an association. Good luck. And in theory, the bigger the association, the better the deal you are going to make. You are going to save a fortune, and you are going to be able to give yourselves and your employees tremendous healthcare. I am really honored by that. Believe me, that is great. With this action, businesses in the same state or businesses in the same industry not just the same state anywhere in the country remember I used to say during the debates, Cross state lines so you can negotiate. You now can cross state lines so you can negotiate. So if 20 or 30 of the businesses in this room get together you get together as a group, an association you pick the meanest, most vicious manager owner to right? Right? To negotiate your healthcare and I know a few of the people in here that are going to do very well. They are they are wild. You will end up with better insurance for far less money. You will end up so great. And, Alex, that is ready as of when? Today. Oh, that is not a bad answer. Today. Today. Stand up, Alex. I call our Secretary of Labor, and they say, Sir, he is very busy. I say, Wait a minute. I am President of the United States. What do you mean? They said, He is working on healthcare. I said, Well, Department of Labor. That is interesting. And that is some great plan. We love it. Thank you, Alex. Very committed to it. And he is now working on an expansion of that, including even larger groups of people. So that is really something that is also going to be very exciting. For the first time ever, sole proprietors will be able to come together and buy lower-cost group insurance instead of getting ripped off by this disaster that we all know as Obamacare. These actions will result in very low prices, much more choice, much more freedom, including in many cases new opportunities to purchase health insurance. You will be able to do this across state lines. That was such a big thing. I'd say, Alex, I want to cross state lines. He said, Do not worry about it. And nobody else you know, this is something we were able to do within the confines of the existing laws. It is a fantastic thing. So it is all set to go. Get going. Make your deals. And the insurance companies and some people are forming their own but the insurance companies are so excited about this. It is going to be very competitive. Let them go and they have made so much money off Obamacare, folks. They got so rich with Obama. Take a look at what happened to our premiums. You know, everyone hears about Obamacare being a disaster, except for the insurance companies. So they are going to have to give a little bit of that money back. Negotiate tough, please. Every American who owns a small business plays a vital role in creating a safe, strong, and prosperous America. And my administration will never forget that truth. Every day you turn ideas into action, you turn vision into creation I know you well and you turn dreams into reality. That is what you do. You do not even realize that is what you do. That is what you do. You embody the spirit of independence and adventure that turned America from 13 colonies into the most incredible republic in the history of humankind. See, I do not mankind anymore; I say humankind. Do the women understand that? I do not know. They want me to be politically correct. What Oh, look, a couple of women are having the thumb up. Right? You like that? You like that. Okay. That is okay. Now I am happy about it. It is the same spirit that inspired previous generations to cross the plains and tame the wilderness, and to build shining cities that touch the sky. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who built the great highways and railroads; who dug out the Panama Canal; who won two world wars; and who put a man on the face of the moon. And if you see what I did yesterday with NASA, right? And you have the Air Force, and now you will soon have the Space Force, because that is where it is at space. That is where it is at. We will be the leader. Together, there is nothing Americans cannot do, because we are one people and one family saluting one great American flag. Thank you. Our future has never looked brighter and that is because of the hardworking Americans like you and millions of small-business owners who took the chance to do what they love: to follow their hearts and to chase their very beautiful dreams. You are the ones who are shaping our industry. You are the ones who are shaping and restoring our prosperity. We are restoring our prosperity. You have seen GDP. You see what projections are who knows but numbers that nobody ever thought possible. I look so forward to seeing some of those numbers. But you see what projections are. People are projecting numbers like nobody thought even possible, numbers that I would likewise like I would not have said on jobs, I would not have said on growth I would not have said. Let us see what happens. But we are doing well as a country. And you are the ones, truly, who are making America great again. So happy anniversary. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.

{"id": 616, "text": "It is great to be in the State capitol. Being here today calls to mind the first time I spoke on the senate floor, almost 20 years ago. And I was passionate, idealistic, ready to make a difference. Just to stand in that magnificent chamber was enough to fill me up with a heightened sense of purpose. And I probably needed a little dose of reality when I first arrived. So one day, I rose to speak about a bill. And I thought I'd made some compelling points, with irrefutable logic. And I was about to sit down, feeling pretty good about myself, when Pate Philip sauntered over to my desk. Now, for the-there are some young people here, so for those of you who do not remember, Pate Philip was the senate majority leader at the time. He was a marine, and a big shock of white hair, stomped-chomped on a cigar, was so politically incorrect that it is you do not even know how to describe it. But he always treated me well. And he came by, and he slapped me on the back, he said: Kid, that was a pretty good speech. In fact, I think you changed a lot of minds. But you did not change any votes. Then, he signaled, and the gavel-and we got blown out. So that was my first lesson in humility. The next came when I presented my own first bill. It was a simple piece of legislation that would make it a lot easier for Illinois manufacturers to hire graduating community college students. I did not know any serious opposition, so I asked for a vote. And what I got was a good hazing. I assume that this custom still exists. So a senior colleague put the vote on hold to ask: Could you correctly pronounce your name for me? I am having a little trouble with it. Obama, I said. Is that Irish? he asked. And being in my early thirties at the time, I was a little cocky. I said, It will be when I run countywide. Now, that was a good joke, he said, but he was not amused. This bill is still going to die. And he went on to complain that my predecessor's name was easier to pronounce than mine, that I did not have cookies at my desk like she did, how would I ever expect to get any votes without having cookies on my desk. I definitely urge a no vote, he said, whatever your name is. And for the next several minutes, the senate debated on whether I should add an apostrophe to my name for the Irish or whether the fact that Obama ends in a vowel meant that I actually belonged to the Italians--and just how many trees had had to die to print this terrible, miserable bill, anyway. And I was chastened. And I said, If I survive this event, I will be eternally grateful and consider this a highlight of my legal and legislative career. And I asked for a vote. And initially, the tote board showed that it was going down, but at the last minute it flipped, and my bill passed. But I was duly reminded that I was a freshman in the minority. And I want to thank all my former colleagues in both chambers for not letting me forget it. Now, to be a rookie in the minority party, as I was, is not much fun in any legislature. And we were called mushrooms, because we were kept in the dark and fed a lot of manure. But one benefit of being in such a position-not being invited into the meetings where the big deals were being made-is that I had a lot of time to get to know my colleagues. And many of us were away from our families, and so we became friends. We went to fish fries together. And we'd go to union halls. We'd play in golf scrambles. We had a great bipartisan poker game at the Illinois Manufacturers' Association. Boro Reljic would host, and folks like Dave Luechtefeld and Terry Link, others, would join in. We'd eat downstairs, and I cannot say I miss the horseshoes. But away from the glare of TV or the tweets or the GIFs of today's media, what we discovered was that despite our surface differences-Democrats and Republicans, downstate hog farmers, inner-city African Americans, suburban businesspeople, Latinos from Pilsen or Little Village-despite those differences, we actually had a lot in common. We cared about our communities. We cared about our families. We cared about America. We fought hard for our positions. And I do not want to be nostalgic here. We voted against each other all the time. And party lines held most of the time. But those relationships, that trust we'd built meant that we came at each debate assuming the best in one another and not the worst. I was reminiscing with Christine Radogno; we came in in the same class. And we were on opposite sides of most issues, but I always trusted her and believed that she was a good person. And if we had a bill that we might be able to work together on, it was a pleasure to work with her on. Or Dave Syverson, who-we worked together on the Public Health and Welfare Committee, and we got some important work done that made a difference in people's lives. And we did not call each other idiots or Fascists who were trying to destroy America. Because then we'd have to explain why we were playing poker or having a drink with an idiot or a Fascist who was trying to destroy America. And that respect gave us room for progress. And after I'd served here for 6 years, my party finally gained the majority. Emil Jones became the president of the senate. And by then, I had made some friends across the aisle, like Kirk Dillard, who I believe is here today, and we were able to pass the first serious ethics reform in 25 years. And working closely with law enforcement, who knew by then that we cared about cops and sheriffs and prosecutors, and working with folks like John Cullerton, we passed Illinois' first racial profiling law, which was good for police officers and minority communities. And because someone like my friend, John Bouman, who worked at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, helped us build coalitions across the State, including with business, and was able to then reach out to Republicans, we were able to increase tax credits for the working poor and expand health insurance to children in need. And we would not bend on our most deeply held principles, but we were willing to forge compromises in pursuit of a larger goal. We were practical when we needed to be. We could fight like heck on one issue and then shake hands on the next. Somebody like Jesse White was able to travel around the State and people did not even know what party he was necessarily from because he brought so much joy with the Tumblers and the work that they were doing. So I want you to know that this is why I have always believed so deeply in a better kind of politics, in part because of what I learned here in this legislature. Because of what I learned traveling across the State, visiting some of your districts, before I was running Statewide, before I was a U.S. Senator, learning all the corners of this State, this most representative of States: a State of small towns and rich farmland and the world's greatest city; a microcosm of America, where Democrats and Republicans and Independents and good people of every ethnicity and every faith shared certain bedrock values. I just saw a story the other day showing that if you rank all 50 States across categories like education levels and household incomes and race and religion, the one State that most closely mirrors America as a whole is Illinois, this State. And I learned by talking to your constituents that if you were willing to listen, it was possible to bridge a lot of differences. I learned that most Americans are not following the ins and outs of the legislature carefully, but they instinctively know that issues are more complicated than rehearsed sound bites, that they play differently in different parts of the State and in the country. They understand the difference between realism and idealism, the difference between responsibility and recklessness. They have the maturity to know what can and cannot be compromised and to admit the possibility that the other side just might have a point. And it convinced me that if we just approached our national politics the same way the American people approach their daily lives-at the workplace, at the Little League game, at church or the synagogue, with common sense and a commitment to fair play and basic courtesy-that there is no problem that we could not solve together. And that was the vision that guided me when I first ran for the United States Senate. That is the vision I shared when I said we are more than just a collection of red States and blue States, but we are the United States of America. And that vision is why, 9 years ago today, on the steps of the Old State Capitol just a few blocks from here, I announced my candidacy for President. Now, over these 9 years, I want you to know, my faith in the generosity and the fundamental goodness of the American people has been rewarded and affirmed over and over and over again. I have seen it in the determination of autoworkers who had been laid off, but were sure that they could once again be part of a great, iconic Americans industry. I have seen it in the single mom who goes back to school even as she is working and looking after her kids because she wants a better life for that next generation. I have seen it the vision and risk-taking of small-businessmen. I have seen it time and time again in the courage of our troops. But it is been noted often by pundits that the tone of our politics has not gotten better since I was inaugurated-in fact, it is gotten worse; that there is still this yawning gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics. Which is why, in my final State of the Union Address, and in the one before that, I had to acknowledge that one of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics. I was able to be part of that here and yet could not translate it the way I wanted to into our politics in Washington. And people ask me why I have devoted so much time to this topic. And I tell them it is not just because I am ENTITY and the polarization and the gridlock are frustrating to me. The fact is we have gotten a heck of a lot done these past 7 years, despite the gridlock. We saved the economy from a depression. We brought back an auto industry from the brink of collapse. We helped our businesses create 14 million new jobs over the past 6 years. We cut the unemployment rate from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. We covered nearly 18 million more Americans with health insurance. We ignited a clean energy revolution. We got bin Laden. We brought the vast majority of our troops home to their families. Our-we got a lot done. We are still getting a lot done. And our political system helped make these things possible, and the list could go on. There is no doubt, America is better off today than when I took office. So I-see, I did not want this to be a State of Union speech--where we have the standing up and the sitting down. Come on, guys, you know better than that. But this will- -no, no, no. I mean, I have got a serious point to make here. I have got a serious point to make here because this is part of the issue, right? We have an importation of our politics nationally and on cable and talk radio, and it seeps into everything. The point I am trying to make is, I care about fixing our politics not only because I am ENTITY today or because some of my initiatives have been blocked by Congress. That happens to every President, happens to every Governor, happens to everybody who participates-anybody who participates in a democracy. You are not going to get a hundred percent of what you want all the time. The reason this is important to me is, next year, I will still hold the most important title of all, and that is the title of citizen. And as an American citizen, I understand that our progress is not inevitable. Our progress has never been inevitable. It must be fought for and won by all of us, with the kind of patriotism that our fellow Illinoisan, Adlai Stevenson, once described not as a short, frenzied outburst of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. It requires citizenship and a sense that we are one. And today, that kind of citizenship is threatened by a poisonous political climate that pushes people away from participating in our public life. It turns folks off. It discourages them, makes them cynical. And when that happens, more powerful and extreme voices fill the void. When that happens, progress stalls. And that is how we end up with only a handful of lobbyists setting the agenda. That is how we end up with policies that are detached from what working families face every day. That is how we end up with the well connected who publicly demand that government stay out of their business, but then whisper in its ear for special treatment. That is how our political system gets consumed by small things when we are a people that are called to do great things: to give everybody a shot in a changing economy, to keep America safe and strong in an uncertain world, to repair our climate before it threatens everything we leave for our kids. So that is what is on my mind as I come back to Illinois today. This is what will be a focus of mine over the course of this year and beyond: What can we do, all of us, together, to try to make our politics better? And I speak to both sides on this. Because all of you know, it could be better, and all of you would feel prouder of the work you do if it was better. So, first, let us put to rest a couple of myths about our politics. One is the myth that the problems with our politics are new. They are not. American politics has never been particularly gentle or high minded, especially not during times of great change. As I mentioned when I visited a mosque in Maryland last week, Thomas Jefferson's opponent tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim. So I am in good company. But that is nothing compared to the newspaper which warned that if Jefferson were elected, murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practiced. His Vice President, Aaron Burr, literally killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. I do not want to even tell you what Andrew Jackson's opponents said about his momma. Lincoln, himself, was routinely called weak, wishy-washy, a yahoo, an unshapely man, the obscene ape of Illinois, and my favorite, a facetious pettifogger. I do not know what that means--but it sounds insulting. So, comparatively speaking, today is not that bad, as long as you have got a thick skin. As Harold Washington once said: Politics ain't beanbag. It is tough. And that is okay. There is also the notion sometimes that our politics are broken because politicians are significantly more corrupt or beholden to big money than they used to be. Now, there is no doubt that lobbyists still have easier access to the halls of power than the average American. There is a lot of work that we need to do to make sure that the system works for ordinary people and not just the well connected. That is true at the Federal level; that is true at the State level. Folks are not entirely wrong when they feel as if the system too often is rigged and does not address their interests. But, relative to the past, listen, I am confident we have got enough rules and checks to prevent anyone in my Cabinet from siphoning whiskey tax revenue into their own pockets like President Grant's administration did. Until FDR went after the ward bosses of Tammany Hall, they were-they controlled judges and politicians as they pleased: patronage, bribery, and money laundering. It is not as easy as it was to whip up tens of thousands of phantom votes, whether in Chicago or South Texas. From the Teapot Dome to Watergate, history tells us we should always be vigilant and demand that our public servants follow the highest ethical standards. But the truth is that the kind of corruption that is blatant, of the sort that we saw in the past, is much less likely in today's politics. And the Justice Department and the media work hard to keep it that way. And that is a very good thing. So we do not want to romanticize the past and think somehow it is a difference in the people being elected. And it also is not true that today's issues are inherently more polarizing than the past. Remember, we endured 4 years of civil war that resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead Americans. This country was divided on a fundamental question. Before Pearl Harbor, entering into World War II was a highly charged debate. The fault lines of Vietnam, the culture wars of the sixties-they still echo into our politics a half-century later. We have been arguing since our founding over the proper size and role of government; the meaning of individual freedom and equality; over war and peace and the best way to give all of our citizens opportunity. And these are important debates that everybody should join, with all the rigor that a free people require. My point is, the problem is not that politicians are worse, the problem is not that the issues are tougher. And so it is important for us to understand that the situation we find ourselves in today is not somehow unique or hopeless. We have always gone through periods when our democracy seems stuck. And when that happens, we have to find a new way of doing business. We are in one of those moments. We have got to build a better politics, one that is less of a spectacle and more of a battle of ideas, one that is less of a business and more of a mission, one that understands the success of the American experiment rests on our willingness to engage all our citizens in this work. And that starts by acknowledging that we do have a problem. And we all know it. What is different today is the nature and the extent of the polarization. How ideologically divided the parties are is brought about by some of the same long-term trends in our politics and our culture. The parties themselves have become more homogenous than ever. A great sorting has taken place that drove Southern conservatives out of the Democratic Party and Northern moderates out of the Republican Party, so you do not have within each party as much diversity of views. And you have got a fractured media. Some folks watch FOX News; some folks read the Huffington Post. And very often, what is profitable is the most sensational conflict and the most incendiary sound bites. And we can choose our own facts. We do not have a common basis for what is true and what is not. I mean, if I listened to some of these conservative pundits, I would not vote for me either. I sound like a scary guy. You have got advocacy groups that, frankly, sometimes benefit from keeping their members agitated as much as possible, assured of the righteousness of their cause. Unlimited dark money-money that nobody knows where it is coming from, who is paying-drowns out ordinary voices. And far too many of us surrender our voices entirely by choosing not to vote. And this polarization is pervasive, and it seeps into our society to the point where surveys even suggest that many Americans would not want their kids to date someone from another political party. Now, some of us do not want our kids dating, period. But that is a losing battle. But this is not just an abstract problem for political scientists. This has real impact on whether or not we can get things done together. This has a real impact on whether families are able to support themselves or whether the homeless are getting shelter on a cold day. It makes a difference as to the quality of the education that kids are getting. This is not an abstraction. But so often, these debates-particularly in Washington, but increasingly in State legislatures-become abstractions. It is as if there are no people involved, it is just cardboard cutouts and caricatures of positions. It encourages the kind of ideological fealty that rejects any compromise as a form of weakness. And in a big, complicated democracy like ours, if we cannot compromise, by definition, we cannot govern ourselves. Look, I am a progressive Democrat. I am proud of that. I make no bones about it. I believe- . I am going to make another point here. I believe that people should have access to health care. I believe they should have access to a good public education. I believe that workers deserve a higher minimum wage. I believe that collective bargaining is critical to the prospects of the middle class and that pensions are vital to retirement, as long as they are funded responsibly. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Sit down, Democrats. Sit down. Sit down, just for a second. I appreciate that, but I want to make this larger point. I believe we are judged by how we care for the poor and the vulnerable. I believe that in order to live up to our ideals, we have to continually fight discrimination in all its forms. I believe in science and the science behind things like climate change and that a transition to cleaner sources of energy will help preserve the planet for future generations. I believe in a tough, smart foreign policy that says America will never hesitate to protect our people and our allies, but that we should use every element of our power and never rush to war. Those are the things I believe. But here is the point I want to make: I believe that there are a lot of Republicans who share many of these same values, even though they may disagree with me on the means to achieve them. I think sometimes my Republican colleagues make constructive points about outdated regulations that may need to be changed or programs that, even though well intended, did not always work the way they were supposed to. And where I have got an opportunity to find some common ground, that does not make me a sellout to my own party. That applies-now-. Well, we will talk later, Dunkin. You just sit down. So the-. This is what happens: Everybody starts cherry-picking. One thing I have learned is, folks do not change. So trying to find common ground does not make me less of a Democrat or less of a progressive. It means I am trying to get stuff done. And the same applies to a Republican who, heaven forbid, might agree with me on a particular issue or if I said America is great, decided to stand during a State of Union. It is not a controversial proposition. You are not going to get in trouble. But the fact that that is hard to do, that is a testament to how difficult our politics has become. Because folks are worried, well, I am going to get yelled at by you, or this blogger is going to write that, or this talk show host is going to talk about me, and suddenly, I have got a challenger, and calling me a RINO or a not a real progressive. So when I hear voices in either party boast of their refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, I am not impressed. All that does is prevent what most Americans would consider actual accomplishments, like fixing roads, educating kids, passing budgets, cleaning our environment, making our streets safe. No, it cuts both ways, guys. See, suddenly, everybody is standing. This is fascinating to watch. The point is, it cuts both ways. Our Founders trusted us with the keys to this system of self-government. Our politics is the place where we try to make this incredible machinery work, where we come together to settle our differences and solve big problems, do big things together that we could not possibly do alone. And our Founders anchored all this in a visionary Constitution that separates power and demands compromise, precisely to prevent one party or one wing of a party or one faction or some powerful interest from getting a hundred percent of its way. So when either side makes blanket promises to their base that it cannot possibly meet: tax cuts without cuts to services- Everything will be fine, but we will not spend any money ; war without shared sacrifice- We are going to be tough, but do not worry, it will be fine ; union bashing or corporate bashing without acknowledging that both workers and businesses make our economy run. That kind of politics means that the supporters will be perennially disappointed. It only adds to folks' sense that the system is rigged. It is one of the reasons why we see these big electoral swings every few years. It is why people are so cynical. Now, I do not pretend to have all the answers to this. These trends will not change overnight. If I did, I would have already done them through an executive action. That was just a joke, guys. Relax. A sense of humor is also helpful. But I do want to offer some steps that we can take that I believe would help reform our institutions and move our system in a way that helps reflect our better selves. And these are not particularly original, but I just want to go ahead and mention them. First is to take-or at least reduce some of the corrosive influence of money in our politics. Now, this year, just over 150 families-150 families-have spent as much on the Presidential race as the rest of America combined. Today, a couple of billionaires in one State can push their agenda, dump dark money into every State-nobody knows where it is coming from-mostly used on these dark ads, everybody is kind of dark and the worst picture possible. And there is some ominous voice talking about how they are destroying the country. And they spend this money based on some ideological preference that really is disconnected to the realities of how people live. They are not that concerned about the particulars of what is happening in a union hall in Galesburg and what folks are going through trying to find a job. They are not particularly familiar with what is happening at a VFW post-- They have not heard personally from farmers outside of the Quads and what they are going through. Those are the voices that should be outweighing a handful of folks with a lot of money. I am not saying the folks with a lot of money should have no voice; I am saying they should not be able to drown out everybody else's. And that is why I disagree with the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. I do not believe that money is speech or that political spending should have no limits or that it should not be disclosed. I still support a constitutional amendment to set reasonable limits on financial influence in America's elections. But amending the Constitution is an extremely challenging and time-consuming process, as it should be. So we are going to have to come up with more immediate ways to reduce the influence of money in politics. There are a lot of good proposals out there, and we have to work to find ones that can gain some bipartisan support, because a handful of families and hidden interests should not be able to bankroll elections in the greatest democracy on Earth. The second step towards a better politics is rethinking the way that we draw our congressional districts. And now, let me point this out. I want to point this out, because this is another case of cherry-picking here. This tends to be popular in States where Democrats have been drawing the lines among Republicans and less popular among Republicans where they control drawing the lines. So nobody's-let us be very clear here, nobody has got clean hands on this thing. Nobody has got clean hands on this thing. The fact is, today, technology allows parties in power to precision-draw constituencies so that the opposition's supporters are packed into as few districts as possible. That is why our districts are shaped like earmuffs or spaghetti. And it is also how one party can get more seats even when it gets fewer votes. And while this gerrymandering may insulate some incumbents from a serious challenge from the other party, it also means that the main thing those incumbents are worried about are challengers from the most extreme voices in their own party. That is what is happened in Congress. You wonder why Congress does not work? The House of Representatives there, there may be a handful-less than 10 percent-of districts that are even competitive at this point. So if you are a Republican, all you are worried about is what somebody to your right is saying about you, because you know you are not going to lose a general election. Same is true for a lot of Democrats. So our debates move away from the middle, where most Americans are, towards the far ends of the spectrum. And that polarizes us further. Now, this is something we have the power to fix. And once the next census rolls around and we have the most up-to-date picture of America's population, we should change the way our districts are drawn. In America, politicians should not pick their voters; voters should pick their politicians. And this needs to be done across the Nation, not just in a select few States. It should be done everywhere. Now, the more Americans use their voice and participate, the less captive our politics will be to narrow constituencies. No matter how much undisclosed money is spent, no matter how many negative ads are run, no matter how unrepresentative a district is drawn, if everybody voted, if a far larger number of people voted, that would overcome in many ways some of these other institutional barriers. It would make our politics better. And that is why a third step towards a better politics is making voting easier, not harder, and modernizing it for the way that we live now. Now, this should not be controversial, guys. You liked the redistricting thing, but not letting people vote. I should get some applause on that too. Look- . Listen, 3 years ago, I set up a bipartisan Commission to improve the voting experience in America. It had the election lawyers from my campaign and from Mitt Romney's campaign. They got together outside of the context of immediate politics. And I actually want to thank this Assembly for moving to adopt some of its recommendations. Thanks to the good work of my dear friend, Senator Don Harmon, and many of you, there is a new law going into effect this year that will allow Illinoisans to register and vote at the polls on election day. It expands early voting, something that makes it a lot easier for working folks and busy parents to go vote. Think about it. If you are a single mom, and you have got to take public transportation to punch a clock, work round the clock, get home, cook dinner on a Tuesday in bad weather, that is tough. Why would we want to make it so that she could not do it on a Saturday or a Sunday? How is that advancing our democracy? So this law will make a difference. I am proud of my home State for helping to lead the way. And we know this works. In 2012 and 2014, the States with the highest voter turnout all had same-day registration. So today I ask every State in America to join us: Reduce these barriers to voting. Make it easier for your constituents to get out and vote. And I'd encourage this Assembly to take the next step. Senator Manar and Representative Gabel have bills that would automatically register every eligible citizen to vote when they apply for a driver's license. That will protect the fundamental right of everybody: Democrats, Republicans, Independents, seniors, folks with disabilities, the men and women of our military. It would make sure that it was easier for them to vote and have their vote counted. And as one of your constituents, I think you should pass that legislation right away. I think the Governor should sign it without delay. Let us make the Land of Lincoln a leader in voter participation. That is something we should be proud to do. Let us set the pace, encourage other States across the country to follow our lead, making automatic voter registration the new norm across America. Now, just during the course of this talk, it is been interesting to watch the dynamics, obviously. In part because so much of our politics now is just designed for short-term, tactical gain. If you think that having more voters will hurt you on election day, then suddenly, you are not interested in participation. And if you think that the gerrymandering is helping you instead of hurting you, then you are not for those proposals. We get trapped in these things. We know better. If we were setting up a set of rules ahead of time, and you did not know where you stood, which party you were going to be in, if you did not have all the data and the poll numbers to tell you what is going to give you an edge or not, you'd set up a system that was fairer. You'd encourage everybody to be part of it. That is what we learned in our civics books. That is how it should work. The fact that we cannot do that, that brings me to my last point, which is, even as we change the way system works, we also have a responsibility to change the way that we, as elected officials and as citizens, work together. Because this democracy only works when we get both right: when the system is fair, but also when we build a culture that is trying to make it work. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about something a friend of mine, Deval Patrick, once said to his constituents when he was Governor of Massachusetts. He said, Insist from us and from each other a modicum of civility as the condition for serving you. This is what he told voters. Insist on us having a modicum of civility. I think that is something that all of us, as Americans, have to insist from each other. Our children are watching what we do. They do not just learn it in school, they learn it by watching us, the way we conduct ourselves, the way we treat each other. If we lie about each other, they learn it is okay to lie. If we make up facts and ignore science, then they do not -they just think it is just their opinion that matters. If they see us insulting each other like school kids, then they think, well, I guess that is how people are supposed to behave. The way we respect-or do not -this-each other as citizens will determine whether or not the hard, frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government continues. And I have got daughters that are getting older now, and one of the most important things about being a parent, I think, is them just seeing what you do not when you are out in public, not when you are dealing with somebody important, but just how do you do-how do you treat people generally. And it makes me much more mindful. I want to live up to their expectations. And in that same way, I want this democracy to live up to the people's expectations. We cannot move forward if all we do is tear each other down. And the political incentives, as they are today, too often rewards that kind of behavior. That is what gets attention. So it will require some courage just to act the way our parents taught us to act. It should not , but in this political environment, apparently, it does. We have got to insist to do better from each other, for each other. Rather than reward those who'd disenfranchise any segment of America, we have got to insist that everybody arm themselves with information and facts and that they vote. If 99 percent of us voted, it would not matter how much the 1 percent spends on our elections. Rather than reward the most extreme voices or the most divisive language or who is best at launching schoolyard taunts, we should insist on a higher form of political discourse in our common life, one based on empathy and respect, which does not mean you abandon principle. It does not mean you are not tough. Rather than paint those who disagree with us as motivated by malice, to suggest that any of us lack patriotism, we can insist, as Lincoln did, that we are not enemies, but friends; that our fellow Americans are not only entitled to a different point of view, but that they love this country as much as we do. Rather than reward a 24/7 media that so often thrives on sensationalism and conflict, we have to stand up and insist, no, reason matters, facts matter, issues are complicated. When folks just make stuff up, they cannot go unchallenged. And that is true for Democrats if you hear a Democrat make something up, and that is true for a Republican if you see a Republican cross that line. Rather than accept the notion that compromise is a sellout to one side, we have got to insist on the opposite: that it can be a genuine victory that means progress for all sides. And rather than preventing our kids from dating people in other parties-well, I may have issues about dating, generally--but we can trust that we have raised our kids to do the right thing and to look at the qualities of people's character, not some label attached to them. And maybe, most of all, whenever someone begins to grow cynical about our politics or believes that their actions cannot make a difference or it is not worth participating in, we have got to insist-even against all evidence to the contrary-that in fact they can make a difference. And in this job of being a citizen of the United States of America, that is a big deal. It is something we should revere and take seriously. Now, Abraham Lincoln was not always the giant that we think of today. He lacked formal schooling. His businesses and his law practices often struggled. After just one term in Congress, his opposition to the Mexican-American War damaged his reputation so badly, he did not run for reelection. He was denounced as a traitor, a demagogue, an enemy sympathizer. He returned to his law practice and admitted he was losing interest in politics entirely. And then, something happened that shook his conscience. Congress effectively overturned the Missouri Compromise, that flawed and fragile law that had prohibited slavery in the North and legalized it in the South, but left the question ultimately unsettled. And stunned by this news, Lincoln said he'd been roused as he had never been before over what it meant for America's future. And so, here in Springfield, at the State fair, he got back in the game, and he delivered the first of his great antislavery speeches to a crowd of thousands. And over the next 6 years, even as he lost two more political races, his arguments with Douglas and others shaped the national debate. That is when he uttered those brilliant words on the steps of the Old State Capitol that A house divided against itself cannot stand, that this government cannot endure permanently, half slave, and half free. He became the first Republican President and, I believe, our greatest President. And through his will and his words and, most of all, his character, he held a nation together, and he helped free a people. And those victories did not solve all of our problems. He would be attacked at times for the compromises he was prepared to make by abolitionists and folks from his own side. It would be 100 years more until the law guaranteed African Americans the equal rights that they had been promised. Even 50 years after that, our march is not yet finished. But because Lincoln made that decision not to give up and not to let other voices speak for him and because he held in his mind the strength of principle, but the vision, the ability to understand those who disagreed with him, and showed them respect even as he fought them-because of what he set in motion, generations of free men and women of all races and walks of life have had the chance to choose this country's course. What a great gift. What a great legacy he has bestowed us. And that is the thing about America. We are a constant work of progress. And our success has never been certain, none of our journey has been preordained. And there is always been a gap between our highest ideals and the reality that we witness every single day. But what makes us exceptional-what makes us Americans-is that we have fought wars and passed laws and reformed systems and organized unions and staged protests and launched mighty movements to close that gap, and to bring the promise and the practice of America into closer alignment. We have made the effort to form that more perfect Union. Nine years to the day that I first announced for this office, I still believe in that politics of hope. And for all the challenges of a rapidly changing world and for all the imperfections of our democracy, the capacity to reach across our differences and choose that kind of politics-not a cynical politics, not a politics of fear, but that kind of politics-sustained over the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime, that is something that remains entirely up to us. Thank you, Illinois. God bless you. God bless America. It is good to see all you. I miss you guys.

{"id": 638, "text": "First, may I greet the distinguished Members of Congress here in the front rows, thank them for coming, thank them for their interest in the passage of this important legislation we are here to celebrate today, but also in their interest in following up on it. May I greet, also, the Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, and our Secretary of HHS Lou Sullivan and the Vice President, of course. He and I welcome you to the Rose Garden. And may I salute the other guests that are with us. And a special thanks today to the men and women from our business community. American corporations, you see, are a vital part of this team, and your support of the ADA is critical to its success. One year ago, I stood over there -- many of you present -- on the South Lawn. And I will never -- literally, never -- forget that sight or certainly the emotional feeling I felt on that day. Thousands of people from across the country had come to celebrate the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, one of the most comprehensive civil rights bills in the history of this country. And while people felt a justifiable sense of triumph last year, you also could see a feeling of eager impatience. After all, the signing of the ADA did not mark the end of a long struggle; it marked, really, a beginning. Some of you here today joined me on the South Lawn, as I mentioned, a year ago, and we have made tremendous advances since that ceremony. We have introduced changes that will transform people's worlds. The ADA has also helped us -- all of us -- to understand a little bit more about ourselves. It reminds us that along with the privilege of being an American comes a duty: to recognize and defend the rights of every American. This bill does more than make the American dream of equality a reality for 43 million Americans with disabilities. It offers, in a sense, fresh testimony to our Nation's greatness. It demonstrates how we can advance the cause of civil rights. It shows what can happen when we work together, drawing upon the fundamental decency of the American people. The quest for civil rights is not a zero-sum game. It should not mean advancing some at the expense of others. The quest for civil rights is a quest for individual rights and equal opportunity and it is a crusade to throw open the doors of opportunity and tear down the walls of bigotry. The ADA works because it calls upon the best in the American people, and then Americans respond. It works because it embodies what must be at the heart of all civil rights struggles: the spirit of inclusiveness, the devotion to individual rights and equal opportunity. That devotion runs deep in our Nation. We are the land or opportunity and always have been. Our Constitution and our courts pledge equal protection under the law. But equally important, our people believe in legal equality -- and many try to broaden opportunity in little ways, by reaching out to capable people and giving them a chance -- giving them a fair chance. America must be a country where the sons and daughters of poverty have the same grasp on the American dream as the children of privilege. And it must be a land where a child can overcome any obstacle and fulfill his or her own potential. We see this promise fulfilled by a man I presented to this Nation 4 weeks ago. And we can be proud to live in a country whose highest Court will include a man who understands the importance of basic American values: tolerance, industry, and decency. And I am speaking, of course, of my nominee to the Court, Clarence Thomas. While Judge Thomas was at the EEOC, he compiled an excellent record on disability issues, with which I hope all of you are familiar. But his life illustrates the principle that inspires all civil rights bills: the principle that we must throw open the doors of opportunity to everyone. And this spirit should guide us as we pursue all civil rights legislation, for our greatest strength lies in our ability to work together and honor the shared values we treasure. We have worked together this last year. And in so doing, we have understood more fully just how much people with disabilities have to offer. We have demonstrated that social progress includes economic growth and that both play essential roles in the American dream. Businesses support the ADA because it gives everyone a chance to be productive in the workplace. It broadens our economic mainstream. It enables society to benefit from the wisdom, energy, and industry of people who want just one thing, a fair chance. And while we have made a strong start, we have much to do. As long as the doors of opportunity are closed to even one American we must keep working at it. The passage of the ADA, the world's first declaration of equality for people with disabilities, made this country the international leader on this human rights issue. And now the world is watching to see how we use this act, how we remove the physical barriers we have created and the social barriers that we have accepted. Our success or failure in keeping the promise of the ADA will affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people with disabilities, not just here in the United States but throughout the world. Our challenges remain great, but our will is even greater. In America -- the most generous, optimistic Nation on the face of the Earth -- we will not rest until every man and woman and child with a dream has a fair chance to realize it. Most of this work will be done by individual Americans acting day by day to increase tolerance and understanding. But the ADA also required five Federal Agencies to come up with implementation regulation or guidelines. These regulations -- relating to employment, public accommodation, transportation, and communications -- are key to the full implementation of ADA. And so I am proud to announce that most of these Federal regs will be issued today. All guidelines required of the Department of Justice, the EEOC, the FCC are in final form, and those regarding transportation will be issued soon. I want to thank the people of the executive branch who have worked so hard to make the ADA a reality. And in addition, today I am issuing a memorandum to Federal Departments and Agencies. And it directs them to recruit people with disabilities as Federal employees and to ensure that Americans with disabilities have access to Federal programs. The Federal Government must serve as a model employer for the rest of the Nation. And again, thank you all so very much for your work, for your dedication, and for your devotion and your steadfast faith and, to many here, for your inspiring example. And may God bless you all. And thank you very, very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkscommemoratingthefirstanniversarythesigningtheamericanswithdisabilities", "title": "Remarks Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Signing of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-commemorating-the-first-anniversary-the-signing-the-americans-with-disabilities", "publication_date": "26-07-1991", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 649, "text": "I WANT to welcome you all to the White House and to tell you that I am very appreciative to have a chance to say a word to you. This is a matter in which I have been greatly interested, and with the support of General Taylor, our Military Representative at the White House, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the AID Agency, CIA, and the other groups in Government, we have been attempting to put a good deal more emphasis in recent months on this problem of counter-insurgency. It has so many ramifications, as you know from your analysis of it, and it requires a mastery of so many different areas of national, international life that it has required, I know, study by all of you at the foreign Service Institute, and will require continued analysis by all of you, I hope, after you graduate, so that we can improve our courses. The foreign Service Institute has done an excellent job in laying this out. We are anxious that all of the military colleges emphasize this phase of our struggle. We are anxious that beginning really at the three military academies, that they attempt to inculcate an interest in this phase of military life. We are anxious that all those who are promoted in the career services of the foreign Service itself, of the CIA, and the AID agency and the military departments, that all of them, particularly the senior officers, have had at least some contact with this subject at various schools so that we become really far more expert than we have ever been in the past. This most ancient form of warfare, going back as it has to its earliest beginnings, has become far more important than it has ever been in the past, and it is going to become more important in the future. As the great weapons become more deadly and as more and more nations possess them, there will be of course, as has been very clearly pointed out by those who make themselves our adversaries, more and more emphasis on this kind of war, insurgency, guerrilla, and the other kind of struggle, the so-called wars of liberation. So that as the thermonuclear weapons get higher and higher in their megatonnage, and as there becomes less and less occasion to use them, then of course there will be more and more emphasis on this kind of struggle. This is not merely a military effort, but it also requires, as I have said, a broad knowledge of the whole development effort of a country, the whole technique of the National Government to identify themselves with the aspirations of people. The problem, of course, that we face is that in so much of the world the problems that the people face are so staggering, and there is no immediate answer to them. The United States does not have sufficient capital itself to make an immediate imprint. We can join the countries and encourage them and offer them hope and indicate that they are moving, but even in a country with the resources of Mexico, with the population increasing nearly 31/2 percent, with I out of every 20 children getting beyond the sixth grade, and a country with the highest standard of living in Latin America, we can see how serious are the problems that so much of the world faces. And therefore this technique of the guerrilla, where you need only one guerrilla, and it requires 15 or 20 troops to track him down, and where you have so much misery which can be exploited, offers a very effective weapon for the overthrow of legitimate governments. We sometimes take some encouragement in the fact that there are so many obvious evidences of a desire of people to be free and a desire of people to maintain their anti-Communist position. What we realize, and I am sure you realize, is the technique of the Communists which emphasizes organization, which requires comparatively few people, the people to be at the pressure point at the key moment. And when you realize the Castro experience, starting with such a small number of people, and what eventually came about, you cannot be satisfied to merely feel that 75 or 80 or 85 percent of the people are anti-Communist. They work on a much more selective basis, and it will require the best we have. So I was anxious to have you come to the White House because we want to emphasize the necessity for the experience which you are going through, that it be shared by all people in the National Government who have anything to do with our international relations. Every senior officer, as I say, in all the key departments must have a comparable experience to yours, have the knowledge that you have, have their attention focused on it. This is particularly true, as I say, in the key agencies, the military across the spectrum, to the State Department, and the agencies in between. They all must concentrate their energy on what is going to be one of the great factors in the struggle of the sixties. So you are particularly welcome at the White House as men who have been among the first to take the particular courses that you have taken. I congratulate the Institute for its initiative, and we are going to attempt to encourage this kind of effort in every other college and school that we have which is involved with national security. So we wish you the best of success. I am glad to sec that your assignments are responsive to your training. A couple of weeks ago we had a group in from, I think, the Institute who had valuable training, and one of them was going to be in charge of reserve officers at Alameda Air force Base. It is not exactly what we want, but I am glad to see that in this case you are all going some place where you can use it, and we wish you the very best of success, because I think you can render a real service to the country.

{"id": 1071, "text": "Good afternoon, all of you. It is now been nearly 5 years since an economic crisis and a punishing recession came together to cost far too many Americans their jobs and their homes and the sense of security that they had built up over time. And by the time I took office, my team and I were facing bubbles that had burst, markets that had cratered, bank after bank on the verge of collapse. And the heartbeat of American manufacturing, our auto industry, was flatlining. And all this meant that hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs each month. So this was a scary time. And nobody had any idea where the bottom would be. Four and a half years later, our businesses have created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 36 months. The American auto industry has come roaring back. We are producing more of our own energy; we are consuming less that we import from other countries. Our deficits are shrinking rapidly. The cost of health care is slowing. The housing market is rebounding. People's retirement savings are growing. The wealth that was lost from that recession has now been recovered. All of this progress is a testament to the grit and resolve of the American people, most of all. But it is also due in some measurable way to the incredible dedication of the men and women who helped to engineer America's response. And two of those people are standing next to me, two very smart economists: Alan Krueger and Jason Furman. Today I can announce that Alan is heading back to teach his beloved students at Michelle's alma mater, Princeton University. When they get together, all they can talk about is Princeton, and they are all very proud, and those of us who did not go to Princeton have to put up with it. And I am proud to say that Jason Furman has agreed to replace Alan as the Chairman of my Council of Economic Advisers. Now, during the crisis, Alan stepped in initially to help engineer our response as Assistant Secretary and chief economist at the Treasury Department. He was so good that we then had to beg him to come back, extend his tour, to serve as the Chairman of my Council of Economic Advisers, where he is been the driving force behind actions that we have taken to help restart the flow of lending to small businesses and create new jobs and arm workers with the skills they need to fill them, to reduce income inequality, to rebuild our aging infrastructure, and to bring down our deficits in a responsible way. And Alan is driven by the basic bargain at the heart of our economy: the idea that hard work should be rewarded. He is motivated by the principle that no one who works full time in the greatest nation on Earth should have to raise their families in poverty or below poverty levels. His commitment to a rising, thriving middle class shines through in his often passionate presentations andat least for an economist, they are passionate and in the policies that he is pushed, and I know this will continue to be a focus of his research. Alan's wife and son are here today, and I know that they are all looking forward to having Alan back. And now that Alan has some free time, he can return to another burning passion of his: rockonomics, the economics of rock and roll. This is something that Alan actually cares about; seriously, on Wednesday, he is giving a speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is got a T-shirt under his suit with a big tongue sticking out. Do not show it. So Alan has become one of my most trusted advisers. He is become a wonderful friend. I am sad to see him go. But I know that he will continue to do outstanding work, and fortunately, he will still be available for us to consult with him periodically, because he is a constant font of good ideas about how we can further help the American people. So thank you very much, Alan, for all the good work that you have done. Now, I am also proud to nominate another outstanding economist to take his place. Jason Furman is one of the most brilliant economic minds of his generation. Do not take my word for it: You can talk to other economists who know a lot more than I do about it. He is won the respect and admiration from his peers across the political spectrum. His Ph.D. thesis adviser, Greg Mankiw, chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. Nobel Prize Winner Joe Stiglitz, on the other side of the economic spectrum, hired Jason to work for the CEA under President Clinton. After leaving President Clinton's White House, Jason finished his Ph.D. in economics, quickly acquired a reputation as a world-class scholar and researcher. But public service kept calling, and Jason's kept answering that call because he believes deeply in it. So from working at the World Bank on issues of inequality and international finance to developing new proposals to strengthen our health and retirement programs, he helped to shape some of our most important economic policy debates. And when I asked him to join my team in 2008, even though his baby daughterthat's right you were this big, had just been bornhe agreed to serve once again. And over the last 5 years, I have come to trust not only his head, but also his heart, because Jason never forgets who it is that we are fighting for: middle class families, folks who are working hard to climb their way into the middle class, the next generation. And when the stakes are highest, there is no one I'd rather turn to for straightforward, unvarnished advice that helps me to do my job. He understands all sides of an argument, not just one side of it. He is worked tirelessly on just about every major economic challenge of the past 4 years, from averting a second depression to fighting for tax cuts that help millions of working families make ends meet, to creating new incentives for businesses to hire, to reducing our deficits in a balanced way that benefits the middle class. And so Eve, Jason's wife, who is an accomplished writer herself, has put up with a lot of hours with Jason away. Henry and Louisa, who are here, they have made a lot of sacrifices so that their husband and dad could be here working for the American people. So I appreciate you guys for sharing daddy just a little bit longer. And the reason it is important is because, while we have cleared away the rubble of crisis and laid a new foundation for growth, our work is nowhere near done. Even though the economy is growing, too many middle class families still feel like they are working harder and harder and cannot get ahead. Inequality is still growing in our society. Too many young people are not sure whether they will be able to match the living standards of their parents. We have too many kids in poverty in this country still. There are some basic steps that we can take to strengthen the position of working people in this country, to help our economy grow faster, to make sure that it is more competitive. And some of that requires political will. Some of it requires an abiding passion for making sure everybody in this country has a fair shot. But it also requires good economists. I know it is called a dismal science, but I do not find it that dismal. I think it is actually pretty interesting. Alan and Jason appreciate that. So sometimes, the rest of my staff thinks, oh, Obama is getting together with his economists, and they are going to have a wonkfest for the next hour. But this stuff matters. It is not just numbers on a page. It makes a difference in terms of whether or not people get a chance at life and also, how do we optimize opportunity and make sure that itwe do not have a contradiction between an efficient, growing, free market economy, and one in which everybody gets a fair shot and where we are caring for the vulnerable and the disabled and folks in our society who need help. So a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs, that rewards hard work and responsibility, that is our north star. Jason shares that focus. I know Alan shares that passion. In Jason's new role as the Chairman of the EconomicCouncil of Economic Advisers, he will be working with some of our country's leading economists, including Jim Stock, who has joined us. And I am relying on them to provide analysis and recommendations with just one thing in mind: What is going to do the most good for the most people in this country, not what is best for a political party, not what is best for a special interest. I do not have another election. It is not what is best for mewhat's best for our middle class, and everybody who is working hard to get there. That is what the American people deserve. So I would urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Jason Furman. And I want to again thank Alan for his outstanding service. I want to thank Jason and his family for continuing to serve the country they love. And for all the economists in the room, thank you for the occasionally underappreciated work that you do. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheresignationalanbkruegerchairmanthecouncileconomicadvisersandthe", "title": "Remarks on the Resignation of Alan B.

{"id": 647, "text": "It is a very great privilege and pleasure for me to be here with you today, but before I begin I have two questions. The first question is: Is it true that the tent over there is filled with good old German beer? Then the second question is: What are we doing out here? I asked one soldier if he drank a lot of beer, and he said, Of course not, sir. The only trouble is, then he tried to blow the foam off his sauerkraut. But every one of you is entitled to all the beer, the sauerkraut, and anything else provided today. After your 2 hard months of intensive field training at Grafenwoehr, you deserve this picnic. As your Commander in Chief, I am now issuing orders that tomorrow, Monday, all members of this brigade who participated in the maneuvers will be given an extra day off. I am very, very proud to be here with the tankers, infantry, and artillery of one of the largest and most powerful combat brigades in Europe. And I am also just as pleased to be here with your wonderful families. Let me say a very special word of commendation to our German partnership units. I thank you for the cooperation you are extending to the United States and our forces. Together you have developed outstanding skills and qualities that make first-rate fighting men. I am pleased that you are learning from each other, and I am also very pleased to meet your charming wives. I deeply appreciate the very high standards of performance and morale of our NATO forces as represented by the Germans and Americans here today, and I thank the Federal Republic and the State of Hesse for the warm, warm hospitality extended to me and to all Americans who are stationed here. There is a very deep satisfaction for me in this meeting here with all of you today. It is most rewarding to see firsthand this evidence of our two countries cooperating within NATO and for the common defense. It is you, together with the other forces of the Alliance, who are making our collective security a reality. As we pursue peace together, I am aware that not all of the problems in Europe and the world have been solved. And I am convinced that under present circumstances, the best guarantee for peace is a very, very strong defense. As President, speaking here in the presence of our allies, I affirm today that I will not allow our Armed Forces to be weakened under any circumstances. You deserve the best. You deserve the very best equipment and you deserve the strongest support of the citizens that you defend. Chancellor Schmidt and myself will travel to Helsinki in the next few days to attend the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is not by accident, let me assure you, that I stopped here first to consult with our allies, nor that I now affirm our commitment to Berlin. I assure the people of Berlin from this military base, which you soldiers call The Rock, that I stand behind this rock and behind our commitment to the freedom of Berlin. Secretary Kissinger spoke for me when he affirmed our policy on his recent visit to Berlin, and our national unity and determination in this regard were voiced there earlier this year by Senators Humphrey and Scott. Soldiers, of course, do not underestimate the importance of your mission and its meaning for the entire world. You are the defenders of peace, and you have my full and unqualified support and respect. I know that you are doing a great, great job. And you, by the demonstrations that you have given in person and by the equipment, you have boosted my morale, and let me express a deep personal gratitude. I thank you very, very much for inviting me on this occasion.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspicnickirchgoensfederalrepublicgermany", "title": "Remarks at a Picnic at Kirchgoens, Federal Republic of Germany", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-picnic-kirchgoens-federal-republic-germany", "publication_date": "27-07-1975", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

{"id": 993, "text": "Mr. Toastmaster, and You, My Fellow-Members of the Union League Club: Let me say in all sincerity, Mr. Davis, that you have expressed far better than I could express what I hold to be essential in American citizenship. It was a privilege, sir, to be greeted by you as you have greeted me tonight. No one can too strongly insist upon the elementary fact that you cannot build the superstructure of public virtue save on private virtue. The sum of the parts is the whole, and if we wish to make that whole, the State, decent, the representative and exponent and symbol of decency, it must be so made through the decency, public and private, of the average citizen. Mr. Davis was quite safe in saying he hoped I had enjoyed my stay in San Francisco. I should indeed be ungrateful, unappreciative, if I were not deeply touched and moved by the way in which the people of San Francisco have received me; and I have enjoyed to the full the two days and a half I have spent here. I have enjoyed it all and I have enjoyed no part more, General MacArthur, than my ride down the line, reviewing the troops with you. Californians are good Americans, and therefore it is not necessary to appeal to them on behalf of the army and the navy. I shall not detain you long this evening. I am promised by Colonel Pippy the chance, after my speech, of meeting and shaking hands with each of you, in the rooms of the Club. I have just got two thoughts, not connected together, to which I want to give utterance tonight; one suggested by something that Mr. Davis said. It is absolutely essential, if we are to have the proper standard of public life, that promise shall be square with performance. A lie is no more to be excused in politics than out of politics. A promise is as binding on the stump as off the stump, and there are two facets to that crystal. In the first place, the man who makes a promise which he does not intend to keep and does not try to keep should rightly be adjudged to have forfeited in some degree what should be every man's most precious possession-his honor. On the other hand, the public that exacts a promise which ought not to be kept, or which cannot be kept, is by just so much forfeiting its right to self-government. There is no surer way of destroying the capacity for self-government in a people than to accustom that people to demanding the impossible or the improper from its public men. No man fit to be a public man will promise either the impossible or the improper; and if the demand is made that he shall do so it means putting a premium upon the unfit in public life. There is the same sound reason for distrusting the man who promises too much in public that there is for distrusting the man who promises too much in private business. If you meet a doctor who asserts that he as a specific remedy that will cure all the ills to which human flesh is heir, distrust him, He has not got it. If you meet the business man who vociferates that he is always selling everything to you at a loss, and you continue to deal with him I am glad if you suffer for it. Any man who promises as a result of legislation or administration the millennium is making a promise which he will find difficulty in keeping. Any man who asserts that by any law it will be possible, out of hand, to make all humanity good and wise, is again promising what he cannot perform. It is indispensable that we should have good laws and upright and honest and fearless administration of the laws; and we are not to be excused if we fail to hold our public men to a rigid accountability if they fail, in their turn, to see that we have proper legislation and proper administration. No public man worth his salt will be other than glad to be held accountable in that fashion. But important though the law is, though the administration of the law is, we can never escape having to face the fundamental truth that neither begins to be of the decisive importance that the average individual's character is. In the last analysis it is the man's own character which is and must ever be the determining factor in his success or failure in life , and therefore in the last analysis it is the average character of the average citizenship of a nation which will in the long run determine whether that nation is to go up or down. The one indispensable thing for us to keep is a high standard of character for the average American citizen. Now for my unrelated second thought, and that is to reiterate something that I said this morning. I had the very great pleasure of dedicating the monument to Dewey's fleet for its victory at Manila. We today were enjoying the aftermath of the triumph, due in part to what Dewey and his officers and men did on the first day of May, five years ago, and in even greater part to what those men did who in the past fifteen years had prepared for the winning of that triumph. I have very great confidence in the capacity of our average soldier or sailor to turn out well, to do admirably when put to the supreme test. But the best man alive, if untrained, if unfitly armed, may be beaten by a poorer man who has had the training and the arms. There is nothing more foolish, nothing less dignified than to indulge in boastfulness, in self-glorification as to the capacity of our soldiers and sailors while denying them the material which we are in honor bound to give them in order that their splendid natural qualities shall be fitly supplemented. I have seen our people send American volunteers against a European soldiery, that , European soldiery armed with the finest type of modern rifle and ours with an old black-powder weapon, which was about as effective as a medieval cross bow; and those who failed to prepare the proper weapons for our people are not to be thanked, because by making drafts of an extraordinary kind upon the other good qualities of the American soldier, we escaped disaster. And who were those who failed to prepare? It is very easy and worse than foolish, it is wicked, to hold the people who at the moment are obliged to use those weapons responsible when the real responsibility lay with the representatives of our people and our people themselves for failing to make the preparation in advance. The business of finding a scapegoat to send loose into the wilderness is neither honorable nor dignified for a self-respecting people to be engaged in. We commemorated today by a monument a great naval victory. We commemorated thereby the foresight, the prudence of the public men, of the great business men, of the shipwrights, the men who worked physically at the armor, the guns, the engines, the hulls, in getting the fleet ready; and, more than that, we commemorated the men who trained that fleet in readiness. Many an officer who was retired before the Spanish War came is entitled to his full share of the credit for what was done in that war, although he never saw it, because he had done his part in actual sea service in training the men to handle the mighty and delicate weapons of war intrusted to their care. Every public man who by his vote helped to make efficient that navy, every business man, every wage-worker, who did honest work on the ships, and every representative of the navy, officer or enlisted man, who in the years before the war faithfully did his duty aboard the ships in fitting crew and ship for the test of war, is entitled to a portion of the credit of the victory in Manila Bay. So it is with the army. I believe-no, I am not going to boast, and so I am going to say a little less than I think-I shall shift the form of my sentence and say that I have entire confidence in the average officer and average enlisted man in the army of the United States if only he is given any kind of a fair chance, but give him good weapons, and give him a chance to handle them and to handle himself so as to be prepared for war. The best man alive, if he is given no chance to practice, cannot be expected when first put to a test to show his abilities at their best. Give us a chance to handle our men in masses in time of peace. Remember that if you scatter the army in fifties or hundreds all over the country, you must expect as inevitable, and as not in the least blameworthy on the part of the army, trouble, when you come to gather them together as an army and to send them into a foreign country. Give our army a chance, or even half a chance, to practice in time of peace the performance of its proper function in time of war, and I can guarantee that the American people will ever in the future have the same cause that they have had in the past to be proud of the army and navy of the United States.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebanquettenderedhimtheunionleagueclubsanfranciscocalifornia", "title": "Theodore Roosevelt Address at the Banquet Tendered Him by the Union League Club of San Francisco, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-banquet-tendered-him-the-union-league-club-san-francisco-california", "publication_date": "14-05-1903", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Theodore Roosevelt"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 716, "text": "Mr. President, I thank you for your wonderful hospitality. First Lady, thank you as well. Please thank the people of this gracious city for hosting such a distinguished group of leaders, spouses, citizens of the world. Two years ago in this city, world leaders formed the Monterrey Consensus. We pledged to work for government that is responsive to the basic needs of every human being and for policies that promote opportunity for all. At this year's summit, we are embracing the challenge of implementing that consensus to bring all the hemisphere's people into an expanding circle of development. To advance these goals, my Nation revolutionized the way we provide aid, and we substantially increased our aid to developing countries. Under our new Compact for Development, U.S. assistance is linked to good governments, investment in people, and economic freedom. Development assistance should light a path to reform and economic growth rather than perpetuate the need for further aid. The nations of this hemisphere must identify concrete steps to implement the noble ideas of the Monterrey Consensus. We must work to provide quality education and quality health care for all our citizens, especially for those suffering from HIV/ AIDS. We must also chart a clear course toward a vibrant free market that will help lift people out of poverty and create a healthy middle class. We must increase the credit available to small businesses that generate the majority of jobs in all our economies and reduce the time that it takes to start a business. We must strengthen property rights so that land can be leveraged as a source of capital to start businesses or hire new workers. And we must lower the cost of sending money home to the families of hard-working men and women who are earning a living abroad. Over the long term, trade is the most certain path to lasting prosperity. The openness of our market is the key driver of growth in the region and a testament to the United States' belief in the mutual benefits of trade. Last year, about 83 percent of Latin America's exports to the United States, roughly $176 billion worth of goods, entered my country duty-free. My country is committed to free and fair trade for this hemisphere through the Free Trade Area of the Americas and through the growing number of bilateral free trade agreements we have completed and are negotiating. Our NAFTA partners have been vital free trade allies for 10 years now. Our free trade agreement with Chile entered into force on the first of this year. We are completing a free trade agreement with our Central American partners. This week we will launch negotiations with the Dominican Republic, and soon we will begin negotiations with Panama and some of our Andean friends. Once completed, these free trade agreements will cover more than two-thirds of the GDP of America's neighbors. The essential foundations of prosperity and progress remain democracy and the rule of law. All nations must prevail in the fight against corruption. We must deny safe haven to corrupt officials and create a culture of transparency in the Americas. Today I signed a proclamation denying corrupt officials entry into my country. I urge other countries to take similar actions. At past summits, we resolved that democracy is the only legitimate form of government in this hemisphere and that the peoples of the Americas have an obligation to promote it and defend it. Those governments in our hemisphere that have responded by supporting democracy can be proud. Our unity and support of democratic institutions, constitutional processes, and basic liberties gives hope and strength to those struggling to preserve their God-given rights, whether in Venezuela or Haiti or Bolivia. And through our democratic example, we must continue to stand with the brave people of Cuba, who for nearly half a century have endured the tyrannies and repression. Dictatorship has no place in the Americas. We must all work for a rapid, peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. Together we will succeed, because the spirit of liberty still thrives, even in the darkest corners of Castro's prisons. We have great opportunities to work together to improve the quality of life for all the people of this hemisphere. To realize our common vision, we must set goals that are specific and measurable. In doing so, we will affirm our determination to succeed and to give hope to millions. Together we will implement the Monterrey Consensus, lift all our nations, and show the world that free societies and free markets can deliver real benefits to our citizens. May God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheinaugurationceremonythespecialsummittheamericasmonterrey", "title": "Remarks at the Inauguration Ceremony of the Special Summit of the Americas in Monterrey", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-inauguration-ceremony-the-special-summit-the-americas-monterrey", "publication_date": "12-01-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 590, "text": "I now light the National Community Christmas Tree on the lawn of the White House in Washington. I have come out here to Independence with my family to celebrate the great home festival. For of all the days of the year Christmas is the family day. Christmas began that way. The moving event of the first Christmas was the bringing forth of the first born in the stable in Bethlehem. There began in humble surroundings the home life of the Holy Family glorified in song and story and in the hearts of men down through the centuries. The great joys and mysteries of that event have forever sanctified and enriched all home life. The Christmas tree which we have just lighted in the South Grounds of the White House back in Washington symbolizes the family life of the Nation. There are no ties like family ties. That is why I have made the journey back to Independence to celebrate this Christmas Day among the familiar scenes and associations of my old hometown. These family ties reach out tonight to embrace the town, the State, the country, all of America--the whole world. The hallowed associations of Christmas draw all hearts toward home. With one accord we receive with joy and reverence the message of the first Christmas: Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will to men. This country, big as it has grown, has always been a close-knit community. It has had to be strong, too. We needed the strength of giants and heroic courage to bring nature and the elements under control; to build our towns-and that is particularly true here in Independence-and to extend our frontiers. We all know what the covered wagon symbolized. But with all our strength we have always had a deep feeling of compassion--a human sympathy for the underdog, the oppressed of all lands, for all who bear heavy burdens. That is a part of the American spirit. I have been thinking of all these things here in my home on North Delaware Street in Independence. I am speaking to you from our family living room. As I came up the street in the gathering dusk, I saw a hundred commonplace things that are hallowed to me on this Christmas Eve--hallowed because of their associations with the sanctuary of home. I saw the lighted windows in the homes of my neighbors, the gaily decked Christmas trees, and the friendly lawns and gardens. The branches of the trees were bare and stark but somehow they looked familiar and friendly. I looked at all these familiar things--the same things that you all will see tonight as you go toward home. These are the thoughts--simple, commonplace, everyday thoughts--that we all share tonight. They are the thoughts that bind us together, one to another. They make up the great American epic--the epic of the home. Yes, America is a big, friendly community. Maybe that is why we realize that we are a part of the whole world. We have had difficult problems, and that is why we can understand the problems of other peoples. Our own struggle fostered this feeling of good will. And good will, after all, is the very essence of Christmas: peace and friendship to men of good will. I want to say once more, with all the emphasis that I can command, that I am working for peace. I shall continue to work for peace. What could be more appropriate than for all of us to dedicate ourselves to the cause of peace on this Holy Night. As a Nation we have a history of a little more than a century and a half. But the religion which came to the world heralded by the song of the Angels has endured for nineteen centuries. It will continue to endure. It remains today the world's best hope for peace if the world will accept its fundamental teaching that all men are brothers. God that made the world and all things therein . . . hath made of one blood all nations of man for to dwell on all the face of the earth. In the spirit of that message from the Acts of the Apostles, I wish all of you a Merry Christmas.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioremarkstheoccasionthelightingthecommunitychristmastreethewhitehouse", "title": "Radio Remarks on the Occasion of the Lighting of the Community Christmas Tree on the White House Grounds", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-remarks-the-occasion-the-lighting-the-community-christmas-tree-the-white-house", "publication_date": "24-12-1948", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

{"id": 976, "text": "Hello, everybody! Hello! Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat, everybody. It is wonderful to be here at Kenmore. And I want to first of all thank our principal, Mr. Dr. John Word Doctor; Superintendent of Arlington Public Schools Patrick Murphy. I believe that the Arlington County School Board is represented here where are they? There they are over there, all doing great work. We have got your own Congressman, Jim Moran, here in the house. And we have got somebody who I believe is going to go down as the finest Secretary of Education we have ever had, Arne Duncan. Now, before I begin, let me just say that like all Americans, I continue to be heartbroken by the images of devastation in Japan. And I know all of you, young and old, have been watching the full magnitude of this tragedy unfold. I want to reiterate America's support for the people of Japan, who are some of our closest friends and allies. And I have said directly to the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Kan, that the United States will continue to offer any assistance we can as Japan recovers from multiple disasters and we will stand with the people of Japan in the difficult days ahead. Now, I just had a chance to talk with some of your teachers as well as some students, who told me about your all-school project that is weaving the life and music of Duke Ellington into your classes. And by getting students engaged in learning, you are teaching the kinds of skills about how to think and how to work together that young people are going to need in college and beyond. That is what all of our schools need to be doing. And in an economy that is more competitive and connected than ever before, a good job and a good career is going to demand a good education. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs are going to require more than a high school diploma. So if you want a bright future, you are going to need a college degree or advanced training. And as Arne mentioned, unfortunately, too many students are not getting a world-class education today. As many as a quarter of American students are not finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. And America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. Understand, we used to be first, and we now rank ninth. That is not acceptable. And turning these statistics around is not just the right thing to do for our kids, it is the right thing to do for our economy, because the best jobs program out there is a good education. The best economic policy is one that produces more college graduates. And that is why for the sake of our children and our economy and America's future, we are going to have to do a better job educating every single one of our sons and daughters, all of them. Now, that responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but it begins in our homes. It begins with parents who are instilling in their kids not only a love of learning, but also the self-confidence and especially the self-discipline and work ethics that are at the heart of success in school and success in life. We have got to work hard. Young people, I am talking to you. I have got a couple of them at home. And the truth is, the world's going to be more competitive, and nobody's going to just give success to you. You are going to have to earn it, and that means you have got to apply yourself. So that you are going to learn at home, first and foremost. But that is not where the responsibility ends. All of us have a responsibility not just as parents, but as citizens for giving our kids the best possible education. Now, for a long time we were not sure about how to give our kids that kind of education. There were a lot of arguments for a lot of years. Some people thought, if you just put more money into education, that would solve the problem. And then on the other side thought, money does not matter, what we need is reform. In fact, there were those who argued that we should just dismantle the public education system altogether. Rather than working together, both sides remained locked in this stalemate year after year, decade after decade, and nothing much changed. And then something began to happen in States and local school districts. Instead of getting caught up in these old, stale debates, people began to agreeing to agree that, you know what, we need both more money and more reform. We need more resources for the schools, but we have got to reorganize how our schools are doing business in order to assure success for our young people. People began coming together parents, students, teachers, administrators, reformers, local officials and we started witnessing amazing success stories all across America. There is a school in Denver, Bruce Randolph School, that went from being one of the worst schools in Colorado to graduating 97 percent of its seniors last May. In Cincinnati, Taft High School went from handing out only one diploma for every five students to graduating 95 percent of its seniors and preparing them for careers in technology. So our goal as an administration, my goal as President, has been to build on these successes across America. We know what can work. And so 2 years ago, we started doing exactly that: trying to figure out how do we incentivize success by starting something a competition called Race to the Top. So what we are doing is we are saying to States: Prove you are serious about reform, and we will show you the money. And because it is a competition for less than 1 percent of what our country spends on education each year, Race to the Top has led over 40 States to raise their standards for teaching, learning, and student achievement. And these standards were not developed in Washington, but they were developed by Republican and Democratic Governors all across this country. So we have made enormous progress. As Arne has said, this is probably the most significant education reform initiative that we have seen in a generation. But we need to make sure we are reaching every child in America, not just those in States or districts that take part in Race to the Top. And that is why not only do we need to continue this competition, we have got to open it up. We are letting local school districts apply. We are going to let local school districts apply. And that is why we need to take the same bottom-up approach when it comes to reforming America's most important education law, otherwise known as No Child Left Behind. We have to reform No Child Left Behind. Now, over these last few weeks, during what we have called Education Month around the White House, I have been traveling across the country talking with folks about education. In fact, we have actually been doing that for the last couple of years. And what I have heard, what Arne's heard, what the rest of my team has heard loud and clear from teachers and students and parents and communities is that No Child Left Behind got some things right and got some things wrong. The goals of No Child Left Behind were the right goals: making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher. That is the right thing to do; that is the right goal. Higher standards are right. Accountability is right. Shining a light on the achievement gap between students of different races and backgrounds and those with and without disabilities, that is the right thing to do. But what has not worked is denying teachers, schools, and States what they need to meet these goals. That is why we need to fix No Child Left Behind. We need to make sure we are graduating students who are ready for college and ready for careers. We need to put outstanding teachers in every classroom and give those teachers the pay and the support that they deserve. I got some applause for that one. We need to not only hold failing schools accountable, we need to help turn those schools around. In the 21st century, it is not enough to leave no child behind, we need to help every child get ahead. We need to get every child on a path to academic excellence. Now, here is the good news: I am proud of the commitment by Democrats and Republicans in Congress to fix No Child Left Behind, to make this reform a reality, because they recognize education is an area where we cannot afford to drag our feet. As Arne says, our kids only get one shot at an education, and we have got to get it right. So that is why I am calling on Congress to send me an education reform bill I can sign into law before the next school year begins before next year's school year. I want every child in this country to head back to school in the fall knowing that their education is America's priority. Let us seize this education moment. Let us fix No Child Left Behind. Now, last week, we got a reminder of why it is so critical that we reform this law. According to new estimates, under the system No Child Left Behind put in place, more than 80 percent of our schools may be labeled as failing 80 percent of our schools. Four out of five schools will be labeled as failing. Now, that is an astonishing number. And our impulse is to either be outraged that the numbers are so high or skeptical that they are even true. And let us face it, skepticism is somewhat justified. We know that four out of five schools in this country are not failing. So what we are doing to measure success and failure is out of line. In fact, the list of supposedly failing schools is includes schools that are making extraordinary progress, including Kenmore. So yes, we have still got more work to do here at this school to close the achievement gap. I think Dr. Word would agree with that. We have got to make sure that every student is on track. But I mean, we can see here at Kenmore what Kenmore's thriving. You guys are doing great. You got more work to do, but you are doing fine. So what this means, though, is, is that we need a better way of figuring out which schools are deeply in trouble, which schools are not , and how we get not only the schools that are in really bad shape on track, how do we help provide the tools to schools that want to get even better to get better. That way of measuring success and failure, that is the first problem with No Child Left Behind that we need to fix. Instead of labeling schools a failure one day and then throwing up our hands and walking away from them, we need to refocus on the schools that need the most help. We need to hold our schools accountable for the success of every child: Black, White, Latino, Asian, students with disabilities, English language learners. We need to make sure some of our best teachers are teaching in some of our worst schools. We need to reward schools that are doing the difficult work of turning themselves around. We are going to have to take a series of steps across a broad range of measures to not only target our most troubled schools, but also raise expectations for all our schools. So first, we are going to have to fix how schools are labeled and identified. But we have got to do more than that. In recent years, 15 States have actually lowered their standards to make it easier for their kids to meet the targets set by No Child Left Behind. Think about that. That was that is a pretty perverse incentive when States say to themselves, you know what, let us lower our standards so that we have an easy time easier time passing those standards so that we do not get punished under No Child Left Behind. That makes no sense. That is inexcusable. So instead of measuring students based on whether they are above or below an arbitrary bar, we need to set better standards to make sure our students are meeting one clear goal: They are graduating ready for college and ready for a career. That is the goal we need to set. To know whether our kids are on track to meet that goal, we need better assessments. Now, I want to speak to teachers in particular here. I am not talking about more tests. I am not talking about teaching to the test. We do not need to know whether a student can fill out a bubble. We do need to know whether they are making progress. We do need to know whether they are not only mastering reading, math, and science, but also developing the kinds of skills, like critical thinking and creativity and collaboration, that I just saw on display with the students that I met here. Those are skills they are going to need for the rest of their lives, not just to be good workers, but to be good citizens. Now, that does not mean testing's going to go away; there will be testing. But the point is, is that we need to refine how we are assessing progress so that we can have accountability without rigidity, accountability that still encourages creativity inside the classroom and empowers teachers and students and administrators. Of course, we also know that better standards, better assessments, and better curriculum will not make a difference without outstanding teachers. Every day in this country, teachers are doing a heroic job for their kids every day. They are taking on the problems that follow students into class, come in early to rewrite lessons, spending hours after school tutoring students. I know; my sister is a teacher. Now, in South Korea, teachers are known as nation builders, and I think it is time we treated our teachers with the same level of respect right here in the United States of America. But if we are serious about treating teachers that way, if we are serious about educating all our kids with an excellent teacher, then we are going to have to fix No Child Left Behind. What No Child Left Behind says is that teachers need to be certified before they step into the classroom. Now, certification can be an important measure of the quality of the teacher, and obviously, we want teachers to be well-qualified. But when the quality of a teacher can make or break a child's education, we have got to make sure our certified teachers are also outstanding teachers, teachers who can reach every last child. And so what we need to do is a better job preparing and supporting our teachers, measuring their success in the classroom, holding them accountable. We are going to have to stop making excuses for the occasional bad teacher. We are going to have to start paying good ones like the professionals that they are. If we truly believe that teaching is one of the most valued professions in society and I cannot think of a more important profession then we have got to start valuing our great teachers. And there are a lot of ways of valuing teachers. I do not know any teacher who got into it for the pay. The teachers who are here, you got into it for the kids, for the satisfaction of feeling like your passing on knowledge that these young people will use and carry on for the rest of their lives. So we need to reward you by letting you make more of a difference for your kids. We need to build on what is being done here at Kenmore: give our best teachers more time to learn from each other, more time to mentor each other, more responsibilities in their schools. And to replace the baby boomers who are retiring in the coming years, we are going to have to recruit a whole new generation of teachers, including a hundred thousand new math and science teachers over the next decade. So these are the steps we are going to have to take to fix No Child Left Behind. And together with what we are already doing to make college more affordable for millions more students, I am confident these reforms will help us meet the goal that I set when I took office, which is, by the end of the decade, we will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. We will be number one again. That is my priority. So these steps will require reforms. They will require a change in rules and standards and even attitudes. But let me just point out, there is no avoiding the fact they will also cost some money. Fixing our failing schools costs money. It requires reform, but it costs some money. Recruiting and rewarding the best teachers will cost money. Making it possible for families to send their kids to college costs money. Now, after a decade of deficits, there is not a lot of money to go around. I understand that. And for too long, Government's been spending more than it is been taking in, and we cannot keep that up. We are going to have to cut whatever spending we can afford to do without. So I have called on a 5-year freeze on annual domestic spending. That will cut the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, making that kind of spending a much smaller share of the economy, smaller than it is been in 50 years. Right now we are sitting down with Republicans and Democrats to find other ways to get our deficits under control. But even as we do, we cannot be reckless and we cannot be irresponsible about how we cut. Let me make it plain: We cannot cut education. We cannot cut the things that will make America more competitive. I mean, think about what happens in your own family when somebody loses a job or has an illness and you need to cut back. What do you do? You start by skipping that vacation you'd been planning, or you see what is on TV instead of going to the movies. Maybe you start packing your own lunch. There are a whole bunch of things that you might do. The last thing you are going to do is to dip into your child's college savings. That is too important. You are not going to give that up. Well, what is true for your family is true for the American family. It is the same principle. A budget that sacrifices our commitment to education would be a budget that is sacrificing our country's future. That would be a budget that sacrifices our children's future, and I will not let it happen. So yes, I am determined to cut our deficits. But I refuse to do it by telling students here, who are so full of promise, that we are not willing to invest in your future. I am not willing to tell these young people right here that their education is not a priority. I am talking about students like Katherine Diaz, who says, I think I should have the opportunity to be who I want to be. And it turns out that Katherine wants to either be a professional violinist or the first woman President of the United States. So she is still Katherine's still she is not sure yet. She might do both. You could do it one at a time: professional violinist, President. Or I am talking about Roberto Claure. Where is Roberto? There is Roberto, right here. He says, With good schools and good teachers, we can grow up to be anything we want. So . It turns out Roberto wants to be the first Hispanic President of the United States. So you guys will have to work out, sort of, the sequence. Roberto, Katherine, the millions of students like them across the country, they need us to offer them the best education possible, not only because that is how they will succeed, not only because that is how we will outcompete countries around the world, but because that is what we do. That is who we are. That is what America's about. We are a place that believes every child, no matter where they come from, can grow up to be anything they want, where Katherine or Roberto or a skinny kid with a funny name named Barack Obama can grow up to be President of the United States. That is who we are. That is the commitment we make to the next generation. And I am confident that if we fix No Child Left Behind, if we continue to reform American education, continue to invest in our children's future, that is the America we will always be. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkskenmoremiddleschoolarlington", "title": "Remarks at Kenmore Middle School in Arlington", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-kenmore-middle-school-arlington", "publication_date": "14-03-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 973, "text": "Well, I just completed a meeting with the Cabinet that is directly in charge of dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. From the beginning, we activated 15 agencies for what is now the largest national response ever to an environmental disaster. And what we wanted to do was make sure that every agency was coordinating and that there was clarity about how we are going to proceed in the coming months. Now, we have gotten reports that have been confirmed by our independent scientists that the top-hat mechanism that was put in place is beginning to capture some of the oil. We are still trying to get a better determination as to how much it is capturing, and we are pushing BP very hard to make sure that all the facilities are available so that as the oil is being captured, it is also being separated properly, that there are receptacles for that oil to go, that we have thought through contingencies in case there is an emergency or a hurricane so that these mechanisms are not disrupted, and that there is a lot of redundancy built in. But here is what we know: Even if we are successful in containing some or much of this oil, we are not going to get this problem completely solved until we actually have the relief well completed, and that is going to take a couple of more months. We also know that there is already a lot of oil that is been released and that there is going to be more oil released no matter how successful this containment effort is. And that is why it is so important for us to continue to put every asset that we have--boom, skimmers, vessels, hiring local folks and local fishermen with their facilities, equipping them with skimmers--getting every asset that we have out there to make sure that we are minimizing the amount of oil that is actually coming to shore. Now, there are a number of other issues that were raised during this meeting that I just want to touch on. Number one, when I was down in the Gulf on Friday, meeting with fishermen and small-business owners, what is clear is that the economic impact of this disaster is going to be substantial and it is going to be ongoing. And as I said on Friday--and I want to repeat--I do not want to see BP nickel-and-diming these businesses that are having a very tough time. Now, we have got the SBA in there helping to provide bridge loans, and we have got the Department of Commerce helping businesses to prepare and document the damages that they are experiencing. But what we also need is BP being quick and responsive to the needs of these local communities. We have individuals who have been assigned specifically to ride herd on BP, to make sure that that is happening. We want the people who are in charge of BP's claims process to be meeting with us on a regular basis. But we are going to insist that that money flows quickly, in a timely basis, so that you do not have a shrimp processor or a fisherman who is going out of business before BP finally makes up its mind as to whether or not it is going to pay out. And that is going to be one of our top priorities, because we know that no matter how successful we are over the next few weeks in some of the containment efforts, the damages are still going to be there. The second thing we talked about quite a bit is the issue of the health of workers who are out there dealing with this spill. So far, we have seen that onshore, we are not seeing huge elevations in toxins in the air or in the water. But that may not be the case out where people are actually doing the work. And we have got to make sure that we are providing all the protections that are necessary. We have put processes in place to make sure that workers out there are getting the equipment and the training they need to protect themselves and their health. But this is something that we are going to have to continue to monitor, because there are a lot of workers out there, and increasingly, we are starting to get individuals who may not be experienced in oil cleanup, because we are trying to get an all-hands-on-deck process. We have got to make sure that they are protected. Obviously, we are also monitoring very carefully the impact to people who are not working out there, and that is where the Environmental Protection Agency is doing constant monitoring of the air and the water quality. And we are also doing testing on the seafood to make sure that toxins are not being introduced into the overall population. A couple of other points I just want to make. Dr. Lubchenco of NOAA reported on convening a scientific conference to make sure that on issues like the plume that is been reported in the news and other questions about how large is this, what kind of damage do we anticipate, et cetera, that we have full transparency, that the information is out there, that it is subject to scientific review so that nobody has any surprises. And what we are going to continue to strive for is complete transparency in real time so that as we get information, the public as a whole gets information, academics, scientists, researchers get this information in what is going to be a fluid and evolving process. Let me just make one final point, and I think this was something that was emphasized by everybody here, and it is something that I want to say to the American people. This will be contained. It may take some time, and it is going to take a whole lot of effort. There is going to be damage done to the Gulf Coast, and there is going to be economic damages that we have got to make sure BP is responsible for and compensates people for. But the one thing I am absolutely confident about is that, as we have before, we will get through this crisis. And it--one of the things that I wanted to make sure we understand is that not only are we going to control the damages to the Gulf Coast, but we want to actually use this as an opportunity to reexamine and work with States and local communities to restore the coast in ways that actually enhance the livelihoods and the quality of life for people in that area. It is going to take some time. It is not going to be easy. But this is a resilient ecosystem. These are resilient people down on the Gulf Coast. I had a chance to talk to them, and they have gone through all kinds of stuff over the last 50, 100 years, and they bounce back. And they are going to bounce back this time. They are going to need help from the entire country. They are going to need constant, vigilant attention from this administration. That is what they are going to get. But we are going to be--we are confident that not only are we going to be able to get past this immediate crisis, but we are going to be focusing our attention on making sure that the coast fully recovers and that eventually it comes back even stronger than it was before this crisis. All right?

{"id": 914, "text": "Governor Dwinell, Members of the New Hampshire Congressional delegation, distinguished guests and my fellow Americans. Only a few moments ago, I had the first opportunity of my life to look at the Old Man of the Mountain. The natural question asked me was, What did you think of it, ENTITY? I answered, as anyone would in polite conversation, and said: Remarkable. Wonderful. Interesting. The real thought that crossed my mind was: what does the Old Man of the Mountain think of us? He has been there through time. In his lonely vigil up at the top of that mountain--let us not try to go back to what he may have been thinking through those ages before our civilization first discovered him--150 years ago he saw great ox carts going through these roads where now we travel in an instant. He saw the fastest means of transportation--the horse. Finally he saw stage coaches. He saw only here and there a habitation, a sparsely settled wilderness. He has seen mankind go from the sailing ship and from the horse and buggy to the jet airplane and the ability to cross the ocean in a few hours. He has seen the great sciences of radio and television come to us. He has seen every American have, with his morning breakfast, the day's news of the world. He has seen the great electronics industry--electric lights, telephones and telegraphy, and all the things by which we live today. All of these changes have come about. But can you believe, as he stands up there, almost in infinite majesty, that he thinks it is of great concern that we travel at a rate that multiplies the speed of our forefathers? I believe he thinks of something deeper than that. Possibly he recalls the words with which our Forefathers started the greatest of all human documents: When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and assume among the powers of the earth that separate and equal status to which both the laws of nature and nature's God intended them, a decent respect for the opinions of mankind impel them to declare the reasons which have led to their separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These immortal words must mean a great deal to the Old Man of the Mountain. He must contemplate them from time to time. I think we--with him--understand life. We know the instinct of self-preservation, and we know what living means to us, in our separate capacities, in our separate areas. We know what liberty is: the individual right to do as we please as long as we do not infringe upon similar rights of others. But the pursuit of happiness--he must have noted that those writers did not create this government to give us happiness. Far better they knew than to try to define happiness for any one of us--the pursuit of happiness in liberty each according to his own desires, to the deepest aspirations of his own soul. Now, what have we done about it? Where do we find happiness? Possibly that is what he is wondering today. We know certain things. We know we would like to be at peace. We do not want to send our boys off into the Armed Services to serve in foreign lands. We do not want to dwell in fear. We do not want to contemplate the horrible things that could happen to us in a new war. At home we want to live comfortably. We want to be well-informed. We want to have neighbors around us that we like. But as we pursue happiness, are we thinking only of these material things? Then how do we attain it? If we attain money to do certain things, then we want more money. If we attain a high office, we want a higher one. If there is no higher one we would like to invent it. We always want something more. Now, what is there more? Maybe the more is to try to discover what others around us find as their idea of the pursuit of happiness, what is it that mankind wants, instead of each of us separately? Can we integrate the desires, the aspirations, the hopes of our community, and then do our part to achieve that? In so doing, I wonder whether the Old Man would not approve of us more than he may at present? Because he well knows, if he has watched us, that each individual is made up of two sets of qualities. One we call the noble: courage, readiness to sacrifice, love for our families, respect for others. And he knows also those other qualities, of selfishness and greed and ambition, and things that set men one against the other, and nations one against the other. He recognizes the right of a group, whether it be community, or whether it be nation, to protect itself, to make certain of its own security. But certainly he must applaud every effort we make to understand others, whether it be individuals, or cities, or States or nations, to understand others as we understand ourselves, and in this way bring somewhat closer, each by his own efforts, that great dream of mankind: a peaceful world in which each of us may continue to develop. Whether we do it through church, or through our schools, through any kind of community enterprise, through the family, through our own reading, we do not seek knowledge for itself. We do not seek acquaintanceship with the classics merely that we may quote a line from it. We seek the knowledge and the thinking of the past that we may bring it together--here today--and help forward, each in his own little fashion, that great progress that I am certain the Old Man of the Mountain yet hopes that mankind will achieve: that objective of peace on earth, goodwill to men. I would not for a moment leave this stand with the thought that we may have these things merely by thinking, or hoping, or wishing. But behind every effort there must be an aspiration, there must be a devotion to a cause. If we are sufficiently devoted to the cause of peace, to the kind of progress of which I speak, we will be strong, and then we will be able to cooperate with others, because only strength can cooperate--weakness cannot cooperate, it can only beg; we will be able to cooperate and to help lead the world toward that promised goal. So I would say our best birthday present to the Old Man of the Mountain is that we make up our minds, each in his own fashion, to do his part in bringing about that hope for mankind that the Old Man must have. Thank you a lot. It has been a great pleasure to meet you all.

{"id": 582, "text": "Thank you very much, Bob, for that fine introduction. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the warm welcome. This is the biggest stage I have been on in quite a while. I am told it is so big because you are having the Oak Ridge Boys tonight. That made me wish I'd been invited later instead of earlier. I want to thank your president, Bill Taylor, for the invitation to come here and Bob Elsner for that fine introduction, especially what he said about health care. I guess if it were easy, it would have been done a long time ago. I look out in this crowd and see many friends of mine from across the country. I saw my good friend Neil Offen, the president of the Direct Selling Association, a minute ago. And I have already spotted five or six people in the audience that I have known for years. I thank you all for inviting me here and for giving me a chance to talk about health care today. I'd like to just begin by trying to put this very briefly in the context in which I view it as your President. I think my job is to do everything I can to help every American reach his or her God-given potential and to try to bring the American people together to make our country stronger. In other words, even though you often do not read about it in these terms, the real purpose of our political system, when it is working properly, is to get people together and to get things done. In the last year, we have been able to bring the deficit down, keep interest rates down, see economic growth come back into this country. In the last 3 months of last year we had the highest growth rate in a decade, the biggest increase in productivity from American workers in 8 years. If our budget is adopted, the one I have presented to the Congress, we will have 3 years of decline in the Federal deficit for the first time since Harry Truman was President and the first real reduction in discretionary nondefense spending since 1969, if this budget is adopted. At the same time, we are moving the money around so we will be investing more in Head Start, more in medical research, more in new technologies to support defense conversion and to rebuild the American economy. We are beginning to turn this situation around and to make this Government work for the American people. But this year we have a lot of other challenges we are facing. The Congress is working on a very important crime bill to put more police officers on the street, to stiffen penalties appropriately, to provide alternative punishments to first-time youthful offenders, to provide some ways for kids to stay out of jail, to take assault weapons off the street. They are doing a lot of important things. That is a big issue. And the Congress is dealing with that as we speak. The Congress will take up welfare reform, a subject on which I have worked for well over a decade now. And I hope they finally will make welfare a second chance, not a way of life, for all Americans and enable us to bring children up in a better fashion. The Congress is going to have a chance now to finally pass a campaign finance reform bill, which will increase the confidence of the American people in the way we do our business here, and a lobby reform bill. There are a lot of issues out there. But I can tell you that if over the long run we expect the American people to be a stronger community, if we expect our economy to have the funds necessary to invest in the growth opportunities of the 21st century, and if you want your Federal Government to be able to respond to the challenges of today and tomorrow, we must address the health care crisis. It is not just a problem for individual American workers and families, it is a problem for the Federal budget and for the national investment patterns. I can tell you, just to give you two examples, in addition to the fact that almost every American, at least those who do not work for larger businesses or for the Government, is at some risk of losing his or her health insurance or of having the inability to change jobs because someone in the family got sick, and almost every small business is at risk of having their premiums explode or their deductibles and copays explode, you also should know that this is a serious competitive problem for us. We are spending 14.5 percent of our income on health care. The Germans are just a little bit over 8 percent of their income. That is about where the Japanese are. Only the Canadians are at 10 percent of their income. If you think about spotting our competitors 512 cents on every dollar spent, that is a significant issue. And almost all of you represent a group of business people who have personally experienced that. And as this economy becomes more global, that will become more relevant. Now, should we spend more money than other countries on health care? I would argue we should and we must, because we invest more in medical research and technology. And we lead the world in that, and that generates jobs, opportunities, and incomes. We have these great academic health centers. Every American, just about, would be happy to pay a premium for that. Must we spend more? The answer to that is, yes, we must; as long as we have higher rates of violence and AIDS and teen pregnancy than other countries, we will have higher bills. Does that account for all of the difference? Not even close. Not even close. A lot of it is directly related to the way we finance health care. The second big problem you should know is this: In the budget we are adopting, we are cutting defense this year for the first time since 1969. If my budget's adopted, we will cut nondefense spending. Social Security will go up, but only by the rate of inflation, and it is paid for by the Social Security taxes, which are in surplus. We will have to pay more on interest on the debt as it accumulates, although not as much as we would if interest rates were not low. The only thing in this whole budget that is really going up by more than the rate of inflation in the Federal budget is health care costs, 2 and 3 times the rate of inflation. And if we do not do something about it, then the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will mean that 2 or 3 or 4 years from now, none of you, no matter whom you represent, will be able to come to Washington and say, How about a new airport, how about a new port, how about a new highway program? How about a new technology investment? How are you going to keep up with our foreign competitors in the seven, eight areas of new technology that will control the future? because we will be spending all of the money you give us in revenues on health care, while we cut everything else. This is a huge problem. And I believe that after 60 years of false starts, we actually have an opportunity to do the right thing, that is, to give every American and every American family health security and have it be the right thing for the American economy and for the future of the United States. For individuals, health security means freedom from fear and the freedom to prosper and the freedom to make choices that now are becoming narrower and narrower for most Americans in health care. For the Nation, it means the ability to bring health care costs within inflation, to have the chance finally to control the deficit, and to allow many businesses now struggling with this problem to be able to invest, to become more productive without having to make the decision to basically terrify their own employees by cutting back health care so much. Is this an easy problem? No. Does anybody have all the answers? No. If it were easy and someone had all of the answers, it would have been done before. You represent more than 22,000 members who serve millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, engineers and teachers, pharmacists and farmers and bankers and Red Cross volunteers. Those are the kind of people served by the American Society of Association Executives. Next year you will turn 75, and for threequarters of a century you have shown the importance of representation, of what can be done when people honestly seek to represent the genuine interest and feelings of their members and come together in a spirit of fairness and openness and try to achieve a common goal. Well, I feel that I almost ought to be a member of this group. I could have a little tag that said the Association of All the American People. And the members of my group want us to deal with the health care problem, and we are trying to do it. The American people want health care to be there when they need it, and they want it to be there at a reasonable price. That is what health insurance used to mean, what it can mean again. I know that because of the opposition of various interest groups and because some of them have changed their position under withering political heat, there are some who have already said, Well, we will not get health care reform; yet again, the people against it will prevail. Well, I say to the naysayers and the pessimists that, not quite so fast. I have seen a lot of endeavors in which I was involved over the last 15 years given up for dead, including my own endeavors, political endeavors. But it is a funny thing about our system here in America. The American people and their representatives, in the end, more than half the time, do the right thing when given the chance. Congress is starting today. I do not know how many Members of the Congress I have had tell me privately in the last week that they are actually becoming more optimistic that we will get a genuine health reform bill out that will provide health security to all Americans. The reality is, and everyone knows this, that while we have the best health care in the world, people who have health insurance today might not have it tomorrow. People who can afford it today might not be able to afford it tomorrow. People who have choices with which they are satisfied today might lose all those choices tomorrow. Preexisting conditions today leave 81 million Americans at risk. It means they can be denied coverage or their rates can be raised or they cannot leave the job they have got for a new one because they will not be able to carry insurance with them. A lot of you represent small businesses. A lot of people would like to leave a bigger business and start their own business or might want to seek a better career opportunity that is in a smaller business than the one in which they are in. But if they have some member of their family that is been sick, they are literally trapped where they are, and they cannot do that. Three out of four Americans have lifetime limits on their policies which means that, for many of them, they can lose their coverage just when they need it the most. Two million families lose their health insurance every month, 100,000 of them permanently. We have seen an increase in the number of Americans without health insurance from 37 to 39 million just in the last 2 years. The health care we have is good, if we can get it. But the health care financing system does not serve the American people well. It is broken. It is unfair. It leads to massive cost-shifting. It leads to, by far, the biggest paperwork burden of any health care system in the world. And I would like to say in simple terms what I believe we should do to fix it. First, we should guarantee private insurance to every American. Second, we should guard the right to choose a doctor and improve the quality of health care plans. Third, we should limit how much insurance companies can raise rates based on whether your business is large or small or you work for the government, whether you are older or younger or whether someone in your family has been sick. And we should make it illegal for people to drop others. But we must set up a system in which insurance companies themselves will not be forced into bankruptcy if we make it illegal to drop them, which is why it is important for people to be able to be insured in large pools. Third, we want to protect and improve Medicare and health care for older Americans. Fourth, we want to provide benefits through the workplace, because that is where 9 of 10 Americans who have insurance already get it. Now, that is the approach. It is not complicated, although millions have been spent to make people think it is complicated; it is not all that complicated. It uses what works today to fix what is wrong today. I know that a lot of people have seen this health security card. Do not leave home without it. But if you know how to use a credit card or a bank card or a Social Security card, people can figure this out. Under the system we have proposed, every American would get a card which stands for not a Government program but guaranteed private insurance and private health providers. The card would permit every American to choose a health care plan, to choose a doctor, to fill out one simple form, and to get health care for a whole year. And at the end of the year, Americans would be able to pick another plan or stay with the same plan or make a different decision. It would not stop any American, over and above that, from paying another private physician for some other service if that was desired. It would, in other words, give more choice than half the American work force has today in their health care plan. Beginning by guaranteeing private insurance for all means that everyone must be covered. That is not only the only way to guarantee security, it is the only way to stop cost-shifting. As long as an insurance company can deny coverage or drop from coverage, then no one is really secure, and some Americans will have to pay the price for other Americans' health care because those who do not have insurance will eventually get health care when it is too late and too expensive, often at an emergency room. And then the cost will be passed on to all the rest of you who are paying for your health care right now in the usual way. That is why I have said that I cannot sign and, indeed, would have to veto a bill that pretended to reform the health care system without providing a system by which everyone is covered. Because unless everyone is covered, there is no cost control, there is no end to cost-shifting, there is no real security, and there is no balance in the system. We are the only country in the world that has not figured out how to do this with an advanced economy, and we ought to be smart enough to do it. I mean, basically when I see all these ads that say we cannot do it, I say, these people are telling me my country is dumber than these other countries. I do not believe that. Or they are telling me that the price of having great health care and great teaching hospitals and great medical research and extraordinary technology is that you have to have some people who do not have anything and all the rest of us have to pay for that besides. I do not believe that. That cannot be true. The benefits package ought to be comprehensive enough to encourage primary and preventive health care because that saves money over the long run. That is a very important part of this. You think about it: Immunizations, mammograms, physicals, prescription drugs, all those things actually avert our health care costs when properly done and keep us healthier. We spend too much time in America treating people when they are sick and not enough time keeping people healthy in the first place. Secondly, we want to preserve and enhance choice as the best guarantee that the quality of American medicine will remain the best in the world. People should be able to choose on their doctors and their health care plans; it guarantees quality. Under our proposal now, everyone would have a chance to make at least one from among three choices, at a minimum, every year. You could choose traditional fee-for-service medicine; you could choose an HMO, for example; you could choose a preferred provider organization that physicians and others organized themselves. But every year you would be given the chance, once again, to make that choice under our proposal. This is important. More and more people under the pressures of the present system are living with shrinking choices. And a lot of people are quite properly worried that those shrinking choices will not only interfere with their choice but will interfere with the quality of health care. There have been a lot of articles written in thoughtful publications in the last few months pointing out that choice is a rapidly vanishing facet of American health care today, and that in fact the attack on our plan as limiting choice is simply not true; that by guaranteeing at least three choices and that you get to make a decision every year again, that we are building into this system a higher level of choice and therefore a guarantee of competition and quality that otherwise would not be the case. Now, the other thing that I want to say about this system is that affordable insurance should be there and should not be able to be taken away. That is why we want to make it illegal for rates to be raised unreasonably or for coverage to be dropped based on age or previous condition of illness. And we know that in order to do that and be fair to the private insurance companies, we have to let people be in large pools. That is, this is what all of you know as community rating. That is the only way you can guarantee that small businesses and selfemployed people and farmers, for example, through some sort of cooperative system, can have access to the same good rates that people in big business and Government do, still have community rating, not discriminate against the old, not discriminate against the worker who is had a sick child or a spouse with cancer, and not bankrupt the insurance companies. If they are going to be able to be a part of this, you have to have some system of community rating. These steps are very important. They put the control of the health care system of America back into the hands of the American people on the one hand and health care providers on the other. Today, the control is determined by the financing, and it is in the hands of the insurance companies. And very often they do what they do because of the way we are all organized and divided, so that even if they do not want to do something that has a harmful effect, the economics of their business dictate it because of the way the system is set up. We cannot permit that to go on anymore. The American people should have the power to choose. The American health care providers should have the power to deliver. There should be incentives to control cost through competition and requiring people to take some responsibility for their own health care. But it should not be organized the way it is now so that the people who are providing the financing in the middle have all the control and themselves are in a position not to make it fairer for many people. We cannot have the security of millions of our people in jeopardy, with a system that they are basically satisfied with when they have it but which could vanish overnight. Another thing I want to say, because there have been a lot of questions about this, is that there is another part of our system we should not mess up: Medicare is one of the best things about American health care because it works and has very low administrative costs, providing health security for millions of older Americans. The question is, how do we keep Medicare healthy as our population gets older? The fastest growing group of Americans in percentage terms are people over 80-hope to be one of them before long. But how are we going to do that? How are we going to take care of our own as health care costs keep rising? We believe that we have to keep Medicare but that we have to recognize that the present system is heavily tilted toward institutionalized care which will not be necessary for some people and which will be explosively expensive as the percentage of our people living in higher age brackets goes higher and higher and higher. So our system, number one, covers prescription medicine along with Medicare, which Medicare does not do now-because we believe there is ample evidence that that keeps people healthier and will save money over the long run; a year's worth of medicine might cost the same thing as a day or two in a hospital-and secondly, by beginning to phasein a long-term care system where we give people some help for making noninstitutional choices, for keeping their parents at home or finding adult day care centers or having in-home care. Because otherwise, you are looking at a population, by the turn of the century and the end of the first decade of the next century, which we simply cannot afford to maintain and would be bad for our country, unless we have more different options to deal with this rapidly aging population. So under our proposal, if you get Medicare you keep it, which also includes the doctor of your choice and medical security. We achieve some savings in the Medicare program by bringing the rate of inflation in Medicare down to twice the rate of normal inflation. When you hear there are all these cuts in Medicare, do not believe it. We are just going to bring the rate of inflation down to twice the normal rate of inflation and take those savings to pay for prescription medicine and to pay for the beginnings of a new and more comprehensive long-term care system. This is, again, terribly important. We cannot do anything to mess up health care security for older people. But we must strengthen it. Finally, I think we should guarantee these benefits at work. And this is, after all, among the organized folks the most controversial decision of all. Nine out of ten Americans who have private insurance get it at work. Eight out of ten Americans who do not have any insurance have someone in their family who works. Expanding the present system lets us reach out to most of the uninsured and is based on shared responsibility. It is the easiest and simplest way to accomplish the goal. It is also the right thing to do. You can never stop cost-shifting until everybody's got insurance. Consider this-I just mentioned welfare reform earlier-if we take a welfare mother with two little kids who says, I hate welfare, and I want to get off of it, and I want to support my children, and you give that fine person job training, and then the woman finds a job. And she goes to work for a small business at an entry-level pay slot, because she got a very limited education, and no health care benefits at the office. And that woman goes from getting a welfare check to getting a paycheck; she begins to pay taxes. She is now paying taxes for someone who made a different decision, who stayed on welfare to keep getting Medicaid, the Government-funded health care program for poor people, which she has given up to go to work. That, by the way, is the central reason that we are having some difficulty moving people from welfare to work. People do not want to hurt their children. Again, this is a system that no other country has. So we have to find a way to do it. Now you say, well, but it is really tough on restaurants who have a lot of young people who are healthy and who do not want to pay for health insurance anyway. Or it is tough on people who have a lot of part-time workers. Some do and some do not ; UPS has over 100,000 part-time workers and insures them all. But you say, it is tough on businesses with part-time workers, and it is certainly tough on small businesses that are eking by. But that is why we reasoned that if we do this, we have to give substantial discounts for small businesses with low average payrolls, low profit margins, difficult times. There are big discounts written into this bill for just that purpose. And the self-employed, for the first time, under our bill, get 100 percent tax deductibility, not limited tax deductibility as they do now. These things will make this insurance more affordable, plus which, if small businesses and self-employed people are in larger pools, they will not be paying higher rates as they do now. One reason small business people have to either not cover their folks or reduce coverage every year is that the average small business premium is 35 percent higher than the average government premium or big business premium. And you cannot blame people for doing something in the face of those kinds of economics. Another reason is, as a restaurant owner told me-the other day I was in Columbus, Ohio, and this restaurant owner said to me, Look, I am getting the worst of all worlds. I have 20 employees full-time and 20 part-time. And I was sick 5 years ago, so our rates went up. It was an eating establishment. She says, I cover my 20 full-time employees. I do not cover the parttime employees. I feel guilty that I do not cover the part-time employees and mad that my competitors do not cover the full-time employees, and I am having to pay higher rates because we had one person, me, in our group of 20 that was sick. So the rates go up, and the deductibles go up. She said, I am getting the worst of all worlds, too high insurance, my competitors have an advantage because I am covering my employees and they are not covering theirs, and I feel just terrible that the part-timers do not get any insurance at all. She said, I would gladly do it all if everybody were treated the same way and we had access to competitive rates. So I would argue that this is still the fairest and best way to make sure everyone is covered, discounts for smaller business, full deductibility for the self-employed, and a system which permits us to overcome the discrimination in rates that small business endures today. So again, this is a private health care system; it builds on what has worked; it is not more Government and more bureaucracy. It uses what is right about the American system, the health care, and fixes what is wrong, the financing. It guarantees permanent private insurance, safeguards the right to choose a doctor and a plan, limits how much rates can be raised because of categories and makes it illegal for people to be dropped, protects and improves Medicare and the health care of senior citizens, and provides health benefits to the workplace. Now, the largest associations of America's family physicians, pediatricians, nurses, and pharmacists have supported this health care plan. Our approach was not designed to hurt anyone. It did have to make some difficult choices. It was designed for the American people. It was about giving life to our best values and dealing with one of our biggest problems. It was about giving families who work hard and do their best to raise their kids the security they deserve; stopping people from paying more because of the irresponsibility of others; stopping a situation in which 8 million older Americans, every month, who are not poor enough to be on the Medicaid program but are on Medicare and have to have medicine every month, 8 million, choosing between food and medicine. It was, in short, about dealing with a problem that is only going to get worse unless we fix it now and doing it in a way that does not interfere with what is finest about our health care system. It is about, ultimately, the freedom of the American people to be free from fear, the freedom to preserve choice, the freedom to preserve quality, and the freedom to grow and prosper into the 21st century, putting our values to work and believing that it is irrational to say that we cannot do something that our competitors have figured out how to do. That is why I think this year we will give every American the freedom that only real health care security can mean. I would encourage you to participate in this outreach, to respond to your communities, the people you honorably represent, not to agree with every jot and tittle of everything in the plan we have presented. If we involve thousands of people and work for months and we know how complicated this is, but the basic things we have to do are fairly simple and straightforward. And we ought not to be in a great political campaign to maneuver symbols here. We ought to be involved in a great national debate of the American family to produce results that will genuinely solve this problem. And so, my fellow Americans, let me end where I began. You represent an awful lot of the American family. You know how the people you represent would be affected by certain changes that were made. The Congress is beginning to debate in earnest. I ask you to support health security for all Americans. I ask you to support doing it through the workplace. I ask you to support preserving Medicare and preserving choice and giving small business people and self-employed people a break. I ask you to support those things. I ask you to enter into this debate and help us to fashion a plan that will meet those objectives. I ask you to do it with a good spirit, with a fair heart, with a sense of commitment to this, because you cannot succeed over the long run with the particular objectives of your group and we cannot succeed over the long run as a whole people unless we face this. If we had done it earlier, it would have been less complex and easier. We'd still have problems with the health care system, the problems with this never go away in any country, but at least it would not have us by the throat, financially and emotionally. We can do this, we can do it this year, and we ought to do it. People like you will speak not with one voice on the details, but with one voice on the urgency of the mission. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheamericansocietyassociationexecutives1", "title": "Remarks to the American Society of Association Executives", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-american-society-association-executives-1", "publication_date": "08-03-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 842, "text": "All our fighting men overseas today have their appointed stations on the far-flung battlefronts of the world. We at home have ours too. We need, we are proud of, our fighting men most decidedly. But, during the anxious times ahead, let us not forget that they need us too. It goes almost without saying that we must continue to forge the weapons of victory- the hundreds of thousands of items, large and small, essential to the waging of the war. This has been the major task from the very start, and it is still a major task. This is the very worst time for any war worker to think of leaving his machine or to look for a peacetime job. And it goes almost without saying, too, that we must continue to provide our Government with the funds necessary for waging war not only by the payment of taxes- which, after all, is an obligation of American citizenship but also by the purchase of war bonds- an act of free choice which every citizen has to make for himself under the guidance of his own conscience. Whatever else any of us may be doing, the purchase of war bonds and stamps is something all of us can do and should do to help win the war. I am happy to report tonight that it is something which nearly everyone seems to be doing. Although there are now approximately sixty-seven million persons who have or earn some form of income, eighty-one million persons or their children have already bought war bonds. They have bought more than six hundred million individual bonds. Their purchases have totaled more than thirty-two billion dollars. These are the purchases of individual men, women, and children. Anyone who would have said this was possible a few years ago would have been put down as a starry-eyed visionary. But of such visions is the stuff of America fashioned. Of course, there are always pessimists with us everywhere, a few here and a few there. I am reminded of the fact that after the fall of France in 1940 I asked the Congress for the money for the production by the United States of fifty thousand airplanes per year. Well, I was called crazy it was said that the figure was fantastic; that it could not be done. And yet today we are building airplanes at the rate of one hundred thousand a year. There is a direct connection between the bonds you have bought and the stream of men and equipment now rushing over the English Channel for the liberation of Europe. There is a direct connection between your bonds and every part of this global war today. Tonight, therefore, on the opening of this Fifth War Loan Drive, it is appropriate for us to take a broad look at this panorama of world war, for the success or the failure of the drive is going to have so much to do with the speed with which we can accomplish victory and the peace. While I know that the chief interest tonight is centered on the English Channel and on the beaches and farms and the cities of Normandy, we should not lose sight of the fact that our armed forces are engaged on other battlefronts all over the world, and that no one front can be considered alone without its proper relation to all. It is worth while, therefore, to make over-all comparisons with the past. Let us compare today with just two years ago-June, 1942. At that time Germany was in control of practically all of Europe, and was steadily driving the Russians back toward the Ural Mountains. Germany was practically in control of North Africa and the Mediterranean, and was beating at the gates of the Suez Canal and the route to India. Italy was still an important military and supply factor- as subsequent, long campaigns have proved. Japan was in control of the western Aleutian Islands; and in the South Pacific was knocking at the gates of Australia and New Zealand- and also was threatening India. Japan had seized control of most of the Central Pacific. American armed forces on land and sea and in the air were still very definitely on the defensive, and in the building-up stage. Our allies were bearing the heat and the brunt of the attack. In 1942 Washington heaved a sigh of relief that the first war bond issue had been cheerfully oversubscribed by the American people. Way back in those days, two years ago, America was still hearing from many amateur strategists and political critics, some of whom were doing more good for Hitler than for the United States- two years ago. But today we are on the offensive all over the world bringing the attack to our enemies. In the Pacific, by relentless submarine and naval attacks, and amphibious thrusts, and ever-mounting air attacks, we have deprived the Japs of the power to check the momentum of our ever-growing and ever-advancing military forces. We have reduced the Japs' shipping by more than three million tons. We have overcome their original advantage in the air. We have cut off from a return to the homeland tens of thousands of beleaguered Japanese troops who now face starvation or ultimate surrender. And we have cut down their naval strength, so that for many months they have avoided all risk of encounter with our naval forces. True, we still have a long way to go to Tokyo. But, carrying out our original strategy of eliminating our European enemy first and then turning all our strength to the Pacific, we can force the Japanese to unconditional surrender or to national suicide much more rapidly than has been thought possible. Turning now to our enemy who is first on the list for destruction- Germany has her back against the wall- in fact three walls at once! In the south- we have broken the German hold on central Italy. On June 4, the city of Rome fell to the Allied armies. And allowing the enemy no respite, the Allies are now pressing hard on the heels of the Germans as they retreat northwards in evergrowing confusion. On the east our gallant Soviet allies have driven the enemy back from the lands which were invaded three years ago. The great Soviet armies are now initiating crushing blows. Overhead vast Allied air fleets of bombers and fighters have been waging a bitter air war over Germany and Western Europe. They have had two major objectives: to destroy German war industries which maintain the German armies and air forces; and to shoot the German Luftwaffe out of the air. As a result, German production has been whittled down continuously, and the German fighter forces now have only a fraction of their former power. This great air campaign, strategic and tactical, is going to continue with increasing power. And on the west the hammer blow which struck the coast of France last Tuesday morning, less than a week ago, was the culmination of many months of careful planning and strenuous preparation. Millions of tons of weapons and supplies, and hundreds of thousands of men assembled in England, are now being poured into the great battle in Europe. I think that from the standpoint of our enemy we have achieved the impossible. We have broken through their supposedly impregnable wall in northern France. But the assault has been costly in men and costly in materials. Some of our landings were desperate adventures; but from advices received so far, the losses were lower than our commanders had estimated would occur. We have established a firm foothold. We are now prepared to meet the inevitable counterattacks of the Germans with power and with confidence. And we all pray that we will have far more, soon, than a firm foothold. Americans have all worked together to make this day possible. The liberation forces now streaming across the Channel, and up the beaches and through the fields and the forests of France are using thousands and thousands of planes and ships and tanks and heavy guns. They are carrying with them many thousands of items needed for their dangerous, stupendous undertaking. There is a shortage of nothing nothing! And this must continue. What has been done in the United States since those days of 1940 when France fell in raising and equipping and transporting our fighting forces, and in producing weapons and supplies for war, has been nothing short of a miracle. It was largely due to American teamwork teamwork among capital and labor and agriculture, between the armed forces and the civilian economy indeed among all of them. And every one every man or woman or child- who bought a war bond helped and helped mightily! There are still many people in the United States who have not bought war bonds, or who have not bought as many as they can afford. Everyone knows for himself whether he falls into that category or not. In some cases his neighbors know too. To the consciences of those people, this appeal by the President of the United States is very much in order. For all of the things which we use in this war, everything we send to our fighting allies, costs money a lot of money. One sure way every man, woman, and child can keep faith with those who have given, and are giving, their lives, is to provide the money which is needed to win the final victory. I urge all Americans to buy war bonds without stint. Swell the mighty chorus to bring us nearer to victory!", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat3", "title": "Fireside Chat.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-3", "publication_date": "12-06-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 754, "text": "Thank you very much. First, let me say to all of you that when we came in here tonight, I think it is fair to say that Hillary and Al and Tipper and I were literally overwhelmed by this reception. And I knew that this was a wonderful community; I knew this was a wonderful school. I knew there was a lot of enthusiasm, but it did not all quite add up until I realized that we had caused your exams to be delayed. And I want you to know that we are having such a good time, we'd be delighted to come back about this time next term if you want. We can make this a regular thing. I want to thank Dr. Williams for his magnificent invocation. I thank Dr. Woodall for the remarks he made, for making us welcome here, and for the example that he and Mr. Spencer, the principal here, all the teachers here, and all the students and teachers from this school and the other schools here represented. I thank you for what you are doing and for the example you are setting for America. I'd like to thank all of our musicians and the choir for playing and singing for us. I thought they were great. And I want to thank Melissa for speaking so well. Were not you proud of her? Did she do a great job, or what? I am glad I never had to run against her for anything. I also want to thank all these wonderful people from Pennsylvania who have come here, all the officials and citizens from this area and from Philadelphia and nearby areas. Let me say, there was a lot of talk tonight keying off Reverend Williams' invocation about vision. I'd like to say something else, if I might, out of respect to others. It is a good thing to have a vision, because otherwise you never know where you are going. So you have to have one. I ran for ENTITY, beginning in 1991, because I thought our country was drifting and because I believed that if you look at these young people here one elementary school in this area has kids from 50 countries speaking 13 languages and if you look at all these young people and their parents and everybody in this room, and you imagine what the world is going to be like, and you know it is going to get smaller and smaller, and we are going to have more and more relationships, and the borders will become more and more open, it is hard to imagine any country in the world that is remotely as well positioned as America to give people the chance to make the most of their own lives. But we had to have a vision. My vision for the 21st century was pretty simple. I wanted us to have a country for the children of the Gores and the Clintons and all the other kids in our country where every person who was a responsible citizen would have a genuine opportunity to live out their dreams. I wanted us to have a country where over all the differences between us we would relish those differences, our racial, our religious, our cultural differences; our serious differences we would debate seriously. But we would honor our common humanity and our shared values as Americans enough to say, what unites us is so much more important than what divides us; we will build one America in the 21st century. And I wanted us to continue to be the country, as we grew more diverse and, therefore, had deeper and deeper ties with more and more other people around the world. I wanted America to recognize that because of our wealth and position, we have not only the opportunity but a responsibility to continue to be the world's leading force for peace and freedom and prosperity for others. It is good for ourselves to do the right thing in trying to build the rest of the world and build closer ties. Now, it is a good thing to have a vision; you cannot get started without it. Otherwise you do not know where you are going. The Vice President talked about Tommy Lasorda and Mike Piazza. My favorite baseball player of all time, because he was such a wonderful speaker, was Yogi Berra. You know, Yogi Berra said, We do not know where we are going, but we are making good time. So you have to have a vision. But you have to have something else, too. You have to have people who are willing to act on it. I hope you could see with the four of us up here, we like being together. We have worked closely together. We see ourselves as a family, and we see our allies as a family. When I came to Washington, I wanted to do something about homelessness, but Tipper Gore helped me do it. I wanted to raise the consciousness of America about all kinds of things that we sort of kept hidden under the rug but were hurting people. Mental health was one of the most important. Tipper Gore helped me do it. I wanted to prove that we could have a smaller Government we now have the smallest Federal Government since 1962 but I wanted to do it in a way that would not just throw good Federal employees in the street and that would enable us to do more. The Vice President made it possible for us to do that; he led that effort. I wanted to prove that we could grow the economy and improve the environment by doing things like building new cars that would triple gas mileage. The Vice President has led our efforts there, and in dealing with all the promise of new technology in trying to hook up all our schools and libraries to the Internet, and in managing a big portion of our relations with Russia, South Africa, and other countries. I can say without qualification that no Vice President in history has had so much responsibility or done so much good. So the vision requires an action. And if it had not been for Hillary, for all the good intentions in the world, we would not have done nearly as much to advance the cause of health care or child care or education or to observe the millennium. We would not have been able to do it. When I see Joe Hoeffel standing up here talking and I know he is going to be a strong force on the committees that he is gotten; I see another new Congressman out there, my longtime friend Bob Brady from Philadelphia. I know that they will be implementers of a vision. Or Chaka Fattah, who got you all worked up, up there, when he stood up; do you know what he did? He passed a bill in the Congress last year that I was for, but I could not have passed it. I will tell you the truth: I could not have done it. But he went around to Republicans and Democrats alike and said, You know, I come from Philadelphia. There are a lot of poor kids there that have never had a real chance. They come from poor families. They live in tough neighborhoods, but they have got good minds. Will you help me pass a bill that will provide the necessary financial support for college students to come in and mentor these kids in middle schools so they will go on to college? And we did it because of that. Now, I will give you one other example. Last time I came here as ENTITY was in 1993, to a conference on entitlement reform. Entitlement reform is a fancy way of saying with everybody living longer and the baby boomers about to retire, all the rest of you are not going to be able to afford to pay our medical and retirement bills unless we do something. That is what entitlement reform means. And I knew the first thing we had to do was to get the economy going. And I said, You know, I have got this economic plan, and it is not going to be very popular with a lot of people because it has a lot of tough decisions. We are asking people who are the wealthiest people in America to pay a little more in income taxes, sometimes a lot more if they were really well off. We are asking people who are used to getting Government programs to do without a few hundred of them until we get this budget in balance. But if we do it, we will lower interest rates, cutting home mortgages and the interest rates on car payments and credit cards, and we will get investment back in the country. We will have jobs coming back in the country. And the money you will save on the stock market going up and the interest rates going down will be far greater than the money those of us who are well off had to pay in a little more taxes. It was very controversial, and people said, Oh, it will bring an end to the economy. It will end the American economy as we know it. It will drive us into recession. Well, you heard what the Vice President said about the country with the longest peacetime expansion in history, the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957, and all of that. What you should know is that this county, this county has had, since that economic program passed and the interest rates started going down, 1,800 new businesses and 44,000 new jobs, the highest growth in the State of Pennsylvania. The decisive vote that made all that possible was cast in Congress by Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. We won by one vote in the House, and it was tied in the Senate. The decisive vote in the Senate was cast by Al Gore. And as he says, since he gets to vote whenever there is a tie, whenever he votes, we win. Now, the point I am trying to make is we had a good vision, but somebody has got to carry the water; somebody has to make the decisions; somebody has to push the rocks up the hill; somebody has to take that step and jump off the diving board; someone has to move. People have to act on their vision. That is why I said last night and that is why that sign says, Let us get to work. We have a good vision, but we must act. And for all of you, I thank you. I wanted to come here to this school because this school district represents what I think America ought to do. I know not every school district has the resources. So if we want everybody to end social promotion but have summer school and afterschool programs, we have to provide the funds from Washington to help the school districts do it. If we want to turn around schools that are not working, we have to provide help from Washington. And we are doing that. But I want people to see this school district all over America, on the news tonight, in the articles tomorrow. I want people to know we came here to a place that has done important things, to give kids who need it extra help, to have high standards, to do things that will create a vision that people will want to act on. I think to have a motto like learn and live to serve is a stunning thing, and I hope you will live by it all your lives. Most of you here know this, but for the benefit of the press, I want to say this: Every high school graduate in this school district gets a license, a driver's license-sized copy of the diploma, and on the back it has the computer skills the graduate has mastered. That is a driver's license to the future. I would like to see that modeled in other places all across America, as well. So you have already heard what we have to say, but it is plain that America is working again. But every one of you knows if we had time to do it, I'd give everybody a piece of paper, and I'd ask you to write down you might do this when you go home tonight. I'd ask you to write down somewhere between three and six things no more than six that you believe are the long-term challenges that will face you young people in the 21st century and what is it that we could do now that would pave the way to a better future for you. I can tell you that I did my best in the State of the Union last night to say, Okay, we have got America working again, but what are the long-term challenges? And you have heard them talked about tonight, and I will not belabor them. But let me say, we have to build strong communities in the 21st century that gives everyone a chance at opportunity. That means we have to do more to have the kind of economic opportunity in places where unemployment is high and people make low wages that you have here. That means putting more money in there. It means teaching adults better skills. It means teaching those who are first-generation Americans to read better, if that is what it takes. It means doing whatever is necessary to get these economies going. It means continuing to drive the crime rate down. It means making all communities livable communities, to set aside the land that we need to set aside, to have the green space, to manage the traffic, to do the things that will make people free and happy if they live anywhere in America. These are the kinds of things we have to do. It means reconciling work and family. One of the best things that the Gores have done is, for the last 7 years, they have had a conference in Tennessee every year on the challenges modern families face. And most all of them relate somehow or other to the need to balance work and family, a challenge that faces Americans in all income groups. I will bet there is not a family here that has not at some point in the last couple of years faced some sort of challenge of balancing your responsibilities to your children to your responsibilities to your work. That is why we want a child care plan that includes help for stay-at-home parents when the children are very young, but real help for working people that cannot afford quality child care on their own. Because in America, when I look at all of you, I want you to be free and confident, when you start your families, that you can do what you want in your work life, but you know that your first responsibility is to raise your children, and you are going to be able to succeed at that responsibility. The Vice President told you that rather gripping story about the HMO's. The truth is we have to manage the health care system; it is like any other system. We have to keep the costs as low as possible. But the quality of our people's health counts most. That is why we say you ought to be able to see a specialist if you need one. You ought to be able to go to the nearest emergency room. You ought to be able to have your medical records private and all of the other things in our Patients' Bill of Rights, because we have got to balance the need to save money with the fundamental necessity of providing quality health care to all Americans. And I'd just like to say one other thing. We have said a lot about education tonight, but I would like to say something about the very first subject I talked about last night in the State of the Union, and that is the aging of America. And again I want to say, this is an issue that should be of primary importance not to today's retirees but to tomorrow's retirees, their children, and their grandchildren yet unborn. Because when the baby boomers retire and that includes the parents of just about all of the students here; people between the ages of 34 and 52 were the people born in the generation after World War II, the largest group of people in history in America, young people, until the present class of students which numbers over 53 million. Now, when we retire, we are going to double the number of seniors by the year 2030. There will be two people working for every one person drawing Social Security. And what we have got and the average life expectancy is already 76 years old plus; for the young people here, it is probably about 83 years. This is a high-class problem. The older you get, the more you will be glad that that is going up. This is a high-class problem. But we do not want to get into a position where our retirement is a financial burden to our children and undermines our children's ability to raise our grandchildren. So when I tell you that we ought to set aside roughly 75 percent of this surplus we have got for the next 15 years to save Social Security and to save Medicare, and in the process, since we will be saving the money, we will be paying down the national debt, giving us the lowest level of debt we have had as a nation since before World War I in 1917, keeping interest rates down, investment high, jobs creation going, and incomes rising I say that not just for those of us who will be older but for our kids and our grandkids. And I hope you will see it that way. This is a big test for us. We have not had this kind of situation in a long, long time. And very rarely do societies have the luxury of being financially strong enough, militarily secure enough, and having enough information about the future to make the kind of decisions that I asked the American people to make last night. Yes, we ought to give some tax cuts, but they ought to be the right kind. They ought to be for child care. They ought to be for helping us to deal with our environmental challenges. They ought to be for people saving for their own retirement, because Social Security will never be enough for that. They ought to be for raising children. But we can save this money now and lift a burden from the young people here. I want every parent here to look at the young people here and ask yourselves: Do you really want to run the risk of squandering this surplus that we have worked so hard for until we know for sure that our retirement will not compromise the integrity of their lives and their ability to raise their children as we have tried to raise them? Now, the young people here are going to have a fascinating time. The Internet is already growing by, you know, millions and millions of new pages every week. It is the fastest growing communication mechanism in human history. People are able to move around as never before, and even if you cannot leave town now, you have got people from all over the world right next door. We are learning things that we have never imagined before. We are on the verge of not only unlocking the mysteries of the human gene but actually finding medical treatments to cure or even prevent things from Alzheimer's to arthritis to all kinds of cancers. This is a stunning time. I went to the auto show in Detroit the other day, and one thing I am looking forward to I love this job, and I am not looking forward to 2 years from now being barred from being ENTITY by the Constitution's two-term limit. But one thing I am looking forward to, now that I have been to the Detroit auto show, is getting back in those cars, because the cars of the future are going to be environmentally sound and hilariously fun to drive and safer. This is going to be an interesting time for you to live in. But we have to do our best in this time to, first of all, make it safe, dealing with the challenges of nuclear and chemical and biological weapons, to give you the strongest communities possible, to build one America across our lines of diversity, and to think about the future. When I ran for ENTITY in 1992, before I ever made the decision to run, a young man who is now not quite so young, he is a graduate student, named Sean Landris was driving me around Los Angeles. I was an anonymous, virtually anonymous Governor of Arkansas. But Sean Landris knew something about me and the speeches I had made and the things I was interested in, and he said, Are you going to run for ENTITY? And I said, Well, I have not decided yet, but I might. He said, Well, if you do, here is what I think your theme song ought to be. And he had a little tape deck in his car, and he put this tape deck in and this old Fleetwood Mac song, Do not Stop Thinking About Tomorrow, which was made before he was born. So we made it our theme song. And I believe that those of us in positions of responsibility have no higher responsibility than to think about your tomorrows. And when you reach our age, you will want more and more to think about the tomorrows of your children and your grandchildren. What I tried to say last night is, there is never been a time when we had brighter tomorrows. All we have to do is act on our vision. Let us get to work. Thank you, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthemontgomerycountycommunitynorristownpennsylvania", "title": "Remarks to the Montgomery County Community in Norristown, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-montgomery-county-community-norristown-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "20-01-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 782, "text": "Mr. Ambassador and Ladies and Gentlemen. For the last few days I have been traveling on a jet airplane. I have found that you have to adjust your schedule, even on an airplane, for the simple reason you get everywhere so rapidly that after you have allowed time for a breakfast or a lunch with a little nap, you have found that the work you were supposed to do has gone by the board and you have landed. The Ambassador does a tittle bit better than that, he takes you back to Italy from here in a matter of seconds. But on this trip I have been talking a lot about America's deep desire for peace, and I know that the peoples of all nations feel exactly as the people of America do. I have traveled in many countries of the world and I have never yet found a people that were belligerent, I know of no men that just long for the battlefield and I know of no women who want to see their men, their sons and their husbands, their sweethearts or their fathers, on the battlefield. So, as far as the longing and aspirations of peoples are involved, we know we are one. But governments have a habit of getting into the way of the sentiments and the feelings of people. It is the governments that conduct propaganda, that put out what they call information--and I am not so sure it always is--people that create problems and then at least say they are attempting to solve them. Now our problem is how do we get across from people to people, so that we can each try to fulfill our own destinies according to the methods of our own choosing? Now I think this is one of the problems and the jobs that people like yourselves help to perform. Political leaders--sometimes they like to call themselves statesmen--are apt to have to deal in generalizations. But you, each of you, with the understanding you display toward another, whether he be of another race or another religion, or different from you in his ideals, but no matter how much this individual may differ, if you are working together and you can understand him and you become friends, you are doing some of the practical work that statesmen and political politicians are talking about. The courtesies that you show to a visitor, no matter how meanly he is dressed or what kind of work he does, when you can show the natural, inborn courtesy and hospitality that is expected of one of God's creatures, because he is talking to another one, that is helping. This of course is a very simple, homely example. In all of the hours of our daily lives, you people have an unusual opportunity to do this. Of course, the example you show here, as you work among yourselves, in itself is helpful. But as you go further afield, in your clubs, in your restaurants, and your places of recreation and places of work--the more that the American Embassy, whether its employees are Americans or Indians, the more that the American Embassy gets a name for being understanding and sympathetic, this is the stuff of which finally peace will be made. It is not going to be made by two or three people sitting in something that is called a summit, and after exchanging a lot of views that rarely agree, and probably are not pertinent to the subject particularly, anyway; you are not going to get peace that way. This is going to be people that do people talking to people. So I say to you that I believe you are not only having the opportunity to do something that for yourselves would be satisfying, in the sense that for your families, for your country, and for your world community, you are really doing something valuable, but it is the kind of thing that the whole world must be doing, if we are going to have the peace that we seek, a peace with justice and of durability. And when I take a look at the Cub Scouts and children of that age, and I stop to think what will be the year, what will be the year on the calendar, when they are my age--say they are 9 now and add 60 years to that, that is two thousand and nineteen--what is that world going to be then? What are we teaching these little fellows and girls--young Americans and young Indians--how to do these things better than we have done them? Because if we do not do it, by that time, two thousand and nineteen, then indeed this poor old world, I think, will be in a sick state. But the point is, if we do our work well, they will do theirs better-and we will have the kind of earth that is moving ahead, with a greater measure of happiness for all people, a greater satisfaction in the work we ourselves have done. So as I say, when I see this kind of crowd, I think of your opportunity to do practical work, where I go around just talking too much sometimes. You do not . You are doing work that is valuable. The people to people is what will save the world. Thank you very much--and goodbye and good luck.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthestafftheusembassyandtheamericancommunitynewdelhi", "title": "Remarks to the Staff of the U.S. Embassy and the American Community in New Delhi.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-staff-the-us-embassy-and-the-american-community-new-delhi", "publication_date": "11-12-1959", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 838, "text": "Thank you all. Please be seated. Thank you all for coming. I am honored today to sign a bill that is an important step in an effort to secure our border, while promoting trade and commerce. It is a good piece of legislation. It is bipartisan legislation. And I want to thank the members of both parties who have worked hard to get this bill to my desk. I want to thank Tom Ridge, who is here. Where are you, Tom? Oh, you are Tom Ridge, yeah. At least that is what some of the Members are saying. I particularly want to thank Senators Kyl and Brownback and Kennedy, Feinstein, and Hatch for being here fine, fine Members of the United States Senate. I want to thank you for coming. I also want to appreciate Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner and George Gekas as well. These Members worked hard on this legislation. I want to thank the members of my administration who are here. I also want to say hello to Arlene Howard. Ms. Howard, it is good to see you. A lot of folks might remember you can stand up. Thank you for coming. Arlene gave me her son, George's, badge and as a reminder of the evil that had been done to our country. You look great. I remember when I went over to Yankee Stadium to throw out the ball there at the World Series, Arlene's one of Arlene's other sons was there. Where is he? Oh, there he is. Thanks for the advice aim high. I want to thank Peter Johnson, who was George's partner for 12 years. Peter, thanks for coming. It is good to see you. I appreciate you being here. Thank you, sir. I want to welcome you all. I was looking at Arlene and the brave folks here; it reminds me of what was done to us there on September 11th and how important it is that we remain tough and strong and diligent as we seek justice, as we chase down these killers one by one and bring them to justice. And that is a major responsibility of all of ours, and it is a responsibility we take seriously. The country is united in our drive for justice. This Nation is determined, and we are patient, much to the chagrin of the enemy. It must make them really worried to know that we do not have a calendar that says, on such-and-such a date we are going to quit, that when it comes to our free-doms defending our freedoms and securing our homeland and protecting our innocent Americans and never forgetting what happened on September the 11th, we are some kind of tough. And that is the way it is going to be. We have got responsibilities here at home as well, and it starts with our borders. Our borders process an incredibly huge number of people. It may come as a surprise to some of you, but there is over 500 million people a year enter America, and half of those are our own citizens that may have been traveling. We have 11 million trucks come across our borders. We have 51,000 foreign ships call into our ports. It reminds us that no nation can be totally secure or more secure, unless we are well-protected and unless our borders are well-screened. We must know who is coming into our country and why they are coming. We must know what our visitors are doing and when they leave. That is important for us to know. It is knowledge necessary to make our homeland more secure. America is not a fortress; no, we never want to be a fortress. We are a free country. We are an open society. And we must always protect the rights of our law of law-abiding citizens from around the world who come here to conduct business or to study or to spend time with their family. That is what we are known for. We are known for respect. But on the other hand, we can do a better job of making our borders more secure and make our borders smart. We must use technology and be wise about how we use technology, to speed the flow of commerce across our borders and to identify frequent travelers who pose no risk. We should be directing resources to risk. We ought to be routing out smugglers and focusing on criminals and, of course, stopping terrorists from coming into the country. The bill I sign today enhances our ongoing efforts to strengthen our borders. The purpose of this bill is to help our country do a better job of border security. It authorizes 400 additional inspectors, investigators, and other staff on the INS over the next 5 years. We are adding manpower, obviously. It makes it easier for the INS and other Federal agencies to get better information about people and products that come into America. It requires every foreign visitor desiring entrance into the United States to carry a travel document containing biometric identification that would be fingerprints or facial recognition that will enable us to use technology to better deny fraudulent entry into America. It strengthens the requirements that all commercial passenger ships and airplanes entering the United States provide a list of passengers and crew before arrival, so that border authorities can act immediately to prevent someone from entering the country if he or she poses a threat to our citizens. It makes a lot of sense to do that. We should have probably been doing it a long time ago. These new measures will only be effective if Federal authorities have access to important information. One of the things we have learned is how to better share information. Right now, the FBI and the CIA do a good job of sharing information. Information is getting better shared from the Federal to the State to the local levels. But we have got to do a better job of sharing information and expanding information to the INS and the State Department and Customs agents and throughout the intelligence community. We have just got to do a better job. This bill enables us to modernize our communication, so the information flows freely and quickly. The legislation requires law enforcement and intelligence communities to continue to develop a list of suspected terrorists and to maintain that list and to make it readily available, so that nobody is granted entry into the United States that is on the list. In other words, we are beginning to gather information overseas in a much better way. We have got a vast coalition of nations that are still with us. They heard the message, Either you are with us, or you are not with us. They are still with us. And we are sharing information, and we can use that better use that information with our own agencies here at home, to make sure that we really button us up, that we do our job, the job the American people expect. The bill did not have everything I wanted. I wanted a temporary extension of 245 in the bill, which basically allowed certain immigrants, sponsored by their families or employers, to become legal residents without having to leave the country, so that families can stay together. I thought that made sense. It is not a part of the bill. I intend to work with Congress to see if we cannot get that done here pretty quick. Yet, the commonsense measures will help us meet the goal, and that is important. It will help us meet the goals of legitimate commerce and important travel. And at the same time, it will help us keep the country secure. Basically what we are saying is, this is part of a legislative part of a national strategy. Tom's worked on the national strategy. He is worked with our respective agency heads. And Congress has been a great partner in this strategy. This is good work. You know, sometimes in Washington we actually are able to put our political parties aside and focus on what is best for the country. And we are able to say, let us make sure America comes is the first priority of all of us. And this has happened in this bill. So it is my honor to welcome both Republicans and Democrats from the legislative branch of Government here as I sign this important legislation. Thank you all for coming. God bless.

{"id": 753, "text": "Thank you very much. First, let me say to all of you that when we came in here tonight, I think it is fair to say that Hillary and Al and Tipper and I were literally overwhelmed by this reception. And I knew that this was a wonderful community; I knew this was a wonderful school. I knew there was a lot of enthusiasm, but it did not all quite add up until I realized that we had caused your exams to be delayed. And I want you to know that we are having such a good time, we'd be delighted to come back about this time next term if you want. We can make this a regular thing. I want to thank Dr. Williams for his magnificent invocation. I thank Dr. Woodall for the remarks he made, for making us welcome here, and for the example that he and Mr. Spencer, the principal here, all the teachers here, and all the students and teachers from this school and the other schools here represented. I thank you for what you are doing and for the example you are setting for America. I'd like to thank all of our musicians and the choir for playing and singing for us. I thought they were great. And I want to thank Melissa for speaking so well. Were not you proud of her? Did she do a great job, or what? I am glad I never had to run against her for anything. I also want to thank all these wonderful people from Pennsylvania who have come here, all the officials and citizens from this area and from Philadelphia and nearby areas. Let me say, there was a lot of talk tonight keying off Reverend Williams' invocation about vision. I'd like to say something else, if I might, out of respect to others. It is a good thing to have a vision, because otherwise you never know where you are going. So you have to have one. I ran for ENTITY, beginning in 1991, because I thought our country was drifting and because I believed that if you look at these young people here one elementary school in this area has kids from 50 countries speaking 13 languages and if you look at all these young people and their parents and everybody in this room, and you imagine what the world is going to be like, and you know it is going to get smaller and smaller, and we are going to have more and more relationships, and the borders will become more and more open, it is hard to imagine any country in the world that is remotely as well positioned as America to give people the chance to make the most of their own lives. But we had to have a vision. My vision for the 21st century was pretty simple. I wanted us to have a country for the children of the Gores and the Clintons and all the other kids in our country where every person who was a responsible citizen would have a genuine opportunity to live out their dreams. I wanted us to have a country where over all the differences between us we would relish those differences, our racial, our religious, our cultural differences; our serious differences we would debate seriously. But we would honor our common humanity and our shared values as Americans enough to say, what unites us is so much more important than what divides us; we will build one America in the 21st century. And I wanted us to continue to be the country, as we grew more diverse and, therefore, had deeper and deeper ties with more and more other people around the world. I wanted America to recognize that because of our wealth and position, we have not only the opportunity but a responsibility to continue to be the world's leading force for peace and freedom and prosperity for others. It is good for ourselves to do the right thing in trying to build the rest of the world and build closer ties. Now, it is a good thing to have a vision; you cannot get started without it. Otherwise you do not know where you are going. The Vice President talked about Tommy Lasorda and Mike Piazza. My favorite baseball player of all time, because he was such a wonderful speaker, was Yogi Berra. You know, Yogi Berra said, We do not know where we are going, but we are making good time. So you have to have a vision. But you have to have something else, too. You have to have people who are willing to act on it. I hope you could see with the four of us up here, we like being together. We have worked closely together. We see ourselves as a family, and we see our allies as a family. When I came to Washington, I wanted to do something about homelessness, but Tipper Gore helped me do it. I wanted to raise the consciousness of America about all kinds of things that we sort of kept hidden under the rug but were hurting people. Mental health was one of the most important. Tipper Gore helped me do it. I wanted to prove that we could have a smaller Government we now have the smallest Federal Government since 1962 but I wanted to do it in a way that would not just throw good Federal employees in the street and that would enable us to do more. The Vice President made it possible for us to do that; he led that effort. I wanted to prove that we could grow the economy and improve the environment by doing things like building new cars that would triple gas mileage. The Vice President has led our efforts there, and in dealing with all the promise of new technology in trying to hook up all our schools and libraries to the Internet, and in managing a big portion of our relations with Russia, South Africa, and other countries. I can say without qualification that no Vice President in history has had so much responsibility or done so much good. So the vision requires an action. And if it had not been for Hillary, for all the good intentions in the world, we would not have done nearly as much to advance the cause of health care or child care or education or to observe the millennium. We would not have been able to do it. When I see Joe Hoeffel standing up here talking and I know he is going to be a strong force on the committees that he is gotten; I see another new Congressman out there, my longtime friend Bob Brady from Philadelphia. I know that they will be implementers of a vision. Or Chaka Fattah, who got you all worked up, up there, when he stood up; do you know what he did? He passed a bill in the Congress last year that I was for, but I could not have passed it. I will tell you the truth: I could not have done it. But he went around to Republicans and Democrats alike and said, You know, I come from Philadelphia. There are a lot of poor kids there that have never had a real chance. They come from poor families. They live in tough neighborhoods, but they have got good minds. Will you help me pass a bill that will provide the necessary financial support for college students to come in and mentor these kids in middle schools so they will go on to college? And we did it because of that. Now, I will give you one other example. Last time I came here as ENTITY was in 1993, to a conference on entitlement reform. Entitlement reform is a fancy way of saying with everybody living longer and the baby boomers about to retire, all the rest of you are not going to be able to afford to pay our medical and retirement bills unless we do something. That is what entitlement reform means. And I knew the first thing we had to do was to get the economy going. And I said, You know, I have got this economic plan, and it is not going to be very popular with a lot of people because it has a lot of tough decisions. We are asking people who are the wealthiest people in America to pay a little more in income taxes, sometimes a lot more if they were really well off. We are asking people who are used to getting Government programs to do without a few hundred of them until we get this budget in balance. But if we do it, we will lower interest rates, cutting home mortgages and the interest rates on car payments and credit cards, and we will get investment back in the country. We will have jobs coming back in the country. And the money you will save on the stock market going up and the interest rates going down will be far greater than the money those of us who are well off had to pay in a little more taxes. It was very controversial, and people said, Oh, it will bring an end to the economy. It will end the American economy as we know it. It will drive us into recession. Well, you heard what the Vice President said about the country with the longest peacetime expansion in history, the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957, and all of that. What you should know is that this county, this county has had, since that economic program passed and the interest rates started going down, 1,800 new businesses and 44,000 new jobs, the highest growth in the State of Pennsylvania. The decisive vote that made all that possible was cast in Congress by Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. We won by one vote in the House, and it was tied in the Senate. The decisive vote in the Senate was cast by Al Gore. And as he says, since he gets to vote whenever there is a tie, whenever he votes, we win. Now, the point I am trying to make is we had a good vision, but somebody has got to carry the water; somebody has to make the decisions; somebody has to push the rocks up the hill; somebody has to take that step and jump off the diving board; someone has to move. People have to act on their vision. That is why I said last night and that is why that sign says, Let us get to work. We have a good vision, but we must act. And for all of you, I thank you. I wanted to come here to this school because this school district represents what I think America ought to do. I know not every school district has the resources. So if we want everybody to end social promotion but have summer school and afterschool programs, we have to provide the funds from Washington to help the school districts do it. If we want to turn around schools that are not working, we have to provide help from Washington. And we are doing that. But I want people to see this school district all over America, on the news tonight, in the articles tomorrow. I want people to know we came here to a place that has done important things, to give kids who need it extra help, to have high standards, to do things that will create a vision that people will want to act on. I think to have a motto like learn and live to serve is a stunning thing, and I hope you will live by it all your lives. Most of you here know this, but for the benefit of the press, I want to say this: Every high school graduate in this school district gets a license, a driver's license-sized copy of the diploma, and on the back it has the computer skills the graduate has mastered. That is a driver's license to the future. I would like to see that modeled in other places all across America, as well. So you have already heard what we have to say, but it is plain that America is working again. But every one of you knows if we had time to do it, I'd give everybody a piece of paper, and I'd ask you to write down you might do this when you go home tonight. I'd ask you to write down somewhere between three and six things no more than six that you believe are the long-term challenges that will face you young people in the 21st century and what is it that we could do now that would pave the way to a better future for you. I can tell you that I did my best in the State of the Union last night to say, Okay, we have got America working again, but what are the long-term challenges? And you have heard them talked about tonight, and I will not belabor them. But let me say, we have to build strong communities in the 21st century that gives everyone a chance at opportunity. That means we have to do more to have the kind of economic opportunity in places where unemployment is high and people make low wages that you have here. That means putting more money in there. It means teaching adults better skills. It means teaching those who are first-generation Americans to read better, if that is what it takes. It means doing whatever is necessary to get these economies going. It means continuing to drive the crime rate down. It means making all communities livable communities, to set aside the land that we need to set aside, to have the green space, to manage the traffic, to do the things that will make people free and happy if they live anywhere in America. These are the kinds of things we have to do. It means reconciling work and family. One of the best things that the Gores have done is, for the last 7 years, they have had a conference in Tennessee every year on the challenges modern families face. And most all of them relate somehow or other to the need to balance work and family, a challenge that faces Americans in all income groups. I will bet there is not a family here that has not at some point in the last couple of years faced some sort of challenge of balancing your responsibilities to your children to your responsibilities to your work. That is why we want a child care plan that includes help for stay-at-home parents when the children are very young, but real help for working people that cannot afford quality child care on their own. Because in America, when I look at all of you, I want you to be free and confident, when you start your families, that you can do what you want in your work life, but you know that your first responsibility is to raise your children, and you are going to be able to succeed at that responsibility. The Vice President told you that rather gripping story about the HMO's. The truth is we have to manage the health care system; it is like any other system. We have to keep the costs as low as possible. But the quality of our people's health counts most. That is why we say you ought to be able to see a specialist if you need one. You ought to be able to go to the nearest emergency room. You ought to be able to have your medical records private and all of the other things in our Patients' Bill of Rights, because we have got to balance the need to save money with the fundamental necessity of providing quality health care to all Americans. And I'd just like to say one other thing. We have said a lot about education tonight, but I would like to say something about the very first subject I talked about last night in the State of the Union, and that is the aging of America. And again I want to say, this is an issue that should be of primary importance not to today's retirees but to tomorrow's retirees, their children, and their grandchildren yet unborn. Because when the baby boomers retire and that includes the parents of just about all of the students here; people between the ages of 34 and 52 were the people born in the generation after World War II, the largest group of people in history in America, young people, until the present class of students which numbers over 53 million. Now, when we retire, we are going to double the number of seniors by the year 2030. There will be two people working for every one person drawing Social Security. And what we have got and the average life expectancy is already 76 years old plus; for the young people here, it is probably about 83 years. This is a high-class problem. The older you get, the more you will be glad that that is going up. This is a high-class problem. But we do not want to get into a position where our retirement is a financial burden to our children and undermines our children's ability to raise our grandchildren. So when I tell you that we ought to set aside roughly 75 percent of this surplus we have got for the next 15 years to save Social Security and to save Medicare, and in the process, since we will be saving the money, we will be paying down the national debt, giving us the lowest level of debt we have had as a nation since before World War I in 1917, keeping interest rates down, investment high, jobs creation going, and incomes rising I say that not just for those of us who will be older but for our kids and our grandkids. And I hope you will see it that way. This is a big test for us. We have not had this kind of situation in a long, long time. And very rarely do societies have the luxury of being financially strong enough, militarily secure enough, and having enough information about the future to make the kind of decisions that I asked the American people to make last night. Yes, we ought to give some tax cuts, but they ought to be the right kind. They ought to be for child care. They ought to be for helping us to deal with our environmental challenges. They ought to be for people saving for their own retirement, because Social Security will never be enough for that. They ought to be for raising children. But we can save this money now and lift a burden from the young people here. I want every parent here to look at the young people here and ask yourselves: Do you really want to run the risk of squandering this surplus that we have worked so hard for until we know for sure that our retirement will not compromise the integrity of their lives and their ability to raise their children as we have tried to raise them? Now, the young people here are going to have a fascinating time. The Internet is already growing by, you know, millions and millions of new pages every week. It is the fastest growing communication mechanism in human history. People are able to move around as never before, and even if you cannot leave town now, you have got people from all over the world right next door. We are learning things that we have never imagined before. We are on the verge of not only unlocking the mysteries of the human gene but actually finding medical treatments to cure or even prevent things from Alzheimer's to arthritis to all kinds of cancers. This is a stunning time. I went to the auto show in Detroit the other day, and one thing I am looking forward to I love this job, and I am not looking forward to 2 years from now being barred from being ENTITY by the Constitution's two-term limit. But one thing I am looking forward to, now that I have been to the Detroit auto show, is getting back in those cars, because the cars of the future are going to be environmentally sound and hilariously fun to drive and safer. This is going to be an interesting time for you to live in. But we have to do our best in this time to, first of all, make it safe, dealing with the challenges of nuclear and chemical and biological weapons, to give you the strongest communities possible, to build one America across our lines of diversity, and to think about the future. When I ran for ENTITY in 1992, before I ever made the decision to run, a young man who is now not quite so young, he is a graduate student, named Sean Landris was driving me around Los Angeles. I was an anonymous, virtually anonymous Governor of Arkansas. But Sean Landris knew something about me and the speeches I had made and the things I was interested in, and he said, Are you going to run for ENTITY? And I said, Well, I have not decided yet, but I might. He said, Well, if you do, here is what I think your theme song ought to be. And he had a little tape deck in his car, and he put this tape deck in and this old Fleetwood Mac song, Do not Stop Thinking About Tomorrow, which was made before he was born. So we made it our theme song. And I believe that those of us in positions of responsibility have no higher responsibility than to think about your tomorrows. And when you reach our age, you will want more and more to think about the tomorrows of your children and your grandchildren. What I tried to say last night is, there is never been a time when we had brighter tomorrows. All we have to do is act on our vision. Let us get to work.

{"id": 978, "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Anne-Marie, for your kind words and for the invitation to be here today. And thank you for your principled leadership-both in government, where we worked together so closely, and now at the New America Foundation. I want to commend you and your colleagues here for the many contributions you make to our national security discourse-including on the challenge that brings us together today. In response to Bashar al-Assad's barbaric use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people, President Obama, after careful consideration, has decided that it is in the national security interest of the United States to conduct limited military strikes against the Syrian regime. President Obama has asked Congress for its support in this action, because in a democracy, our policies are stronger, more effective and more sustainable when they have the support of the American people and their elected leaders. Tomorrow evening, the President will address the nation and make his case for taking action. Today, I want to take this opportunity to explain why Syria's use of chemical weapons is a serious threat to our national security, and why it is in our national interest to undertake limited military action to deter future use. There is no denying what happened on August 21. Around 2:30 in the morning, while most of Damascus was still asleep, Assad's forces loaded warheads filled with deadly chemicals onto rockets and launched them into suburbs controlled or contested by opposition forces. They unleashed hellish chaos and terror on a massive scale. Innocent civilians were jolted awake, choking on poison. Some never woke up at all. In the end, more than 1400 were dead-more than 400 of them children. In recent days, we have been shocked by the videos from Ghouta and other neighborhoods near Damascus. As a parent, I cannot look at those pictures-those little children laying on the ground, their eyes glassy, their bodies twitching-and not think of my own two kids. I can only imagine the agony of those parents in Damascus. Sarin is odorless and colorless, so victims may not even know they have been exposed until it is too late. Sarin targets the body's central nervous system, making every breath a struggle and causing foaming at the nose and mouth, intense nausea and uncontrollable convulsions. The death of any innocent, in Syria or around the world, is a tragedy, whether by bullet or landmine or poisonous gas. But chemical weapons are different. They are wholly indiscriminate. Gas plumes shift and spread without warning. The masses of people they can fell are immense. The torturous death they bring is unconscionable. Chemical weapons, like other weapons of mass destruction, kill on a scope and scale that is entirely different from conventional weapons. Opening the door to their use anywhere threatens the United States and our personnel everywhere. There is no doubt about who is responsible for this attack. The Syrian regime possesses one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Assad has been struggling to clear these very neighborhoods in Damascus and drive out the opposition, but his conventional arsenal was not working well enough or fast enough. Only the Syrian regime has the capacity to deliver chemical weapons on a scale to cause the devastation we saw in Damascus. The opposition does not. The rockets were fired from territory controlled by the regime. The rockets landed in territory controlled or contested by the opposition. And the intelligence we have gathered reveals senior officials planning the attack and then, afterwards, plotting to cover up the evidence by destroying the area with shelling. Of course, this is not the first time that Assad has used chemical weapons in this conflict; we assess that he has used them on a small-scale multiple times since March. But August 21 was very different. Whereas previous attacks each killed relatively few people, this one murdered well over a thousand in one fell swoop. Assad is lowering his threshold for use while increasing exponentially the lethality of his attacks. Assad's escalating use of chemical weapons threatens the national security of the United States. And the likelihood that, left unchecked, Assad will continue to use these weapons again and again takes the Syrian conflict to an entirely new level-by terrorizing civilians, creating even greater refugee flows, and raising the risk that deadly chemicals would spill across borders into neighboring Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. Obviously, the use of chemical weapons also directly threatens our closest ally in the region, Israel, where people once again have readied gas masks. Every time chemical weapons are moved, unloaded, and used on the battlefield, it raises the likelihood that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists active in Syria, including Assad's ally Hezbollah and al Qaeda affiliates. That prospect puts Americans at risk of chemical attacks targeted at our soldiers and diplomats in the region and even potentially our citizens at home. Equally, every attack serves to unravel the long-established commitment of nations to renounce chemical weapons use. 189 countries, representing 98 percent of the world's population, are party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, acquisition, or use of these weapons. The United States Senate approved that convention by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority, binding America to the global consensus and affirming that we do not tolerate the use or possession of chemical weapons. So, the Assad regime's attack is not only a direct affront to that norm but also a threat to global security, including the security of the United States. Failing to respond to this outrage also threatens our national security. Failing to respond means more and more Syrians will die from Assad's poisonous stockpiles. Failing to respond makes our allies and partners in the region tempting targets of Assad's future attacks. Failing to respond increases the risk of violence and instability as citizens across the Middle East and North Africa continue to struggle for their universal rights. Failing to respond brings us closer to the day when terrorists might gain and use chemical weapons against Americans abroad and at home. Failing to respond damages the international principle reflected in two multilateral treaties and basic human decency that such weapons must never again be used anywhere in the world. Failing to respond to the use of chemical weapons risks opening the door to other weapons of mass destruction and emboldening the madmen who would use them. We cannot allow terrorists bent on destruction, or a nuclear North Korea, or an aspiring nuclear Iran to believe for one minute that we are shying away from our determination to back up our long-standing warnings. If we begin to erode the moral outrage of gassing children in their bed, we open ourselves up to even more fearsome consequences. Moreover, failing to respond to this brazen attack could indicate that the United States is not prepared to use the full range of tools necessary to keep our nation secure. Any President, Republican or Democrat, must have recourse to all elements of American power to design and implement our national security policy - whether diplomatic, economic, or military. Rejecting the limited military action that President Obama strongly supports would raise questions around the world as to whether the United States is truly prepared to employ the full range of its power to defend our national interests. America's ability to rally coalitions and lead internationally could be undermined. Other global hotspots might flare up if belligerents believe the United States cannot be counted on to enforce the most basic and widely accepted international norms. Most disturbingly, it would send a perverse message to those who seek to use the world's worst weapons - that you can use these weapons blatantly and get away with it. Now, I know that many Americans are horrified by the images from Damascus and are concerned about the devastating broader consequences. But, while they believe the world should act, they are not sure military action is the right tool at this time. Let me address this important argument. The reason President Obama decided to pursue limited strikes is that we and others have already exhausted a host of other measures aimed at changing Assad's calculus and his willingness to use chemical weapons. As the August 21 mass casualty attack makes clear, these efforts have not succeeded. So only after pursuing a wide range of non-military measures to prevent and halt chemical weapons use did President Obama conclude that a limited military strike is the right way to deter Assad from continuing to employ chemical weapons like any conventional weapon of war. The fact is, President Obama has consistently demonstrated his commitment to multilateral diplomacy. He would much prefer the backing of the United Nations Security Council to uphold the international ban against the use of chemical weapons, whether in the form of sanctions, accountability, or authorizing the use of force. But let us be realistic-it is just not going to happen now. Believe me, I know. I was there for all of those UN debates and negotiations on Syria. I lived it. And it was shameful. Three times the Security Council took up resolutions to condemn lesser violence by the Syrian regime. Three times we negotiated for weeks over the most watered-down language imaginable. And three times, Russia and China doubled vetoed almost meaningless resolutions. Similarly, in the past two months, Russia has blocked two resolutions condemning the use of chemical weapons that did not even ascribe blame to any party. Russia opposed two mere press statements expressing concern about their use. A week after the August 21 gas attack, the United Kingdom presented a resolution that included a referral of war crimes in Syria to the International Criminal Court, but again the Russians opposed it, as they have every form of accountability in Syria. For all these reasons, the President has concluded that it is in our national security interest to conduct limited strikes against the Assad regime. I want to take this opportunity to address concerns now that even limited strikes could lead to even greater risk to the United States. So, let me describe, as plainly as I can, what this action would be-and, just as importantly, what it would not be. The President has been clear about our purpose: these would be limited strikes to deter the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons and to degrade their ability to do so again. What do we mean by limited? This would not be the United States launching another war. As the President has said, repeatedly, this will not be Iraq or Afghanistan. There will be no American boots on the ground-period. Nor would it resemble Kosovo or Libya, which were sustained air campaigns. This will not be an open-ended effort. As the President has said, again repeatedly, this action would be deliberately limited in both time and scope. Nor would this be new. The United States has engaged in limited strikes multiple times before. Recall President Reagan conducted air strikes measured in hours against Libya in 1986. President Clinton conducted several days of cruise missile strikes against Iraq in 1998. No two military actions are identical. Each has its own costs and benefits. But these previous engagements are proof that the United States is fully capable of conducting limited, defined and proportional military actions without getting enmeshed in a drawn out conflict. What do we mean by deterring and degrading the regime's chemical weapons capabilities? Strikes could target a range of potential regime capacities to manage, deliver, or develop chemical weapons. Assad would discover that, henceforth, chemical weapons offer no battlefield advantage relative to their cost to use. And, if Assad is so brazen as to use chemical weapons again, he would know that we possess the ability to further degrade his capabilities. So, in short, this would not be an open-ended intervention in the Syrian civil war. These strikes would not aim to topple Assad or, by themselves, to effect regime change. Doing so would require a much larger and sustained military campaign, putting American forces in the center of this civil conflict. And, as President Obama has made clear, it is neither wise nor necessary to do so. Like many, I understand the public skepticism over using military force, particularly in this part of the world. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have left many Americans wary of further military action, however limited. But what the President is proposing is fundamentally different. Unlike Iraq, we are not betting on the existence of weapons of mass destruction. In Syria, we have the undeniable proof that chemical weapons have already been unleashed with horrific results. The entire world can see the bodies. True, there are always risks that accompany the use of military force. That is why we are taking a range of responsible measures to safeguard U.S. personnel and interests in the region, as well as those of our allies and partners. In this event, we do not assess that limited military strikes will unleash a spiral of unintended, escalatory reactions in the region. Assad and his allies would be more than foolish to take on the forces of the United States or our allies. They know that President Obama, throughout his presidency, has amply demonstrated he will not hesitate to defend our nation, our citizens, and our allies against direct threats to our security. The limited strikes that the President plans are necessary and appropriate, which is why they have garnered support on both sides of the political aisle. House and Senate leaders have declared their full support. Foreign policy experts from the left, right and center have strongly endorsed such action. There are not many non-partisan issues left in Washington. This is one-or at least it should be. President Obama has asked Congress for their support as the elected representatives of the American people, because he knows that investing the legislative branch in our policy choices helps ensure the maximum potency and sustainability of U.S. policy. This decision reflects the President's profound respect for the power of our democracy and his belief that the American people care to defend our most basic values and live up to our leadership in the world. And he knows, like all Americans, that we are strongest in the world when we speak clearly and stand together. At the same time, the international community increasingly recognizes that this chemical weapons attack cannot be ignored. The Arab League foreign ministers have called for deterrent and necessary measures. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation has said the regime's attack requires a decisive action. The NATO Council has met twice, and Secretary General Rasmussen has affirmed that the allies agree on the need for a firm international response to avoid chemical weapon attacks in the future. Last Friday, at the G-20 in St. Petersburg, there was unanimous agreement that chemical weapons had been used and that the international norm against their use must be upheld. We gained unequivocal public support for anticipated U.S. military action from partners in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States joined together in a strong statement declaring that the Assad regime is responsible for the attack and that those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable. In subsequent days, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Croatia, Estonia, Denmark, Romania, and Qatar have signed on to that same statement, and we expect more countries to add their support. Over the weekend, European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton issued a statement on behalf of the European Union labeling the August 21 attack a blatant violation of international law, a war crime, and a crime against humanity and calling for a clear and strong response to ensure there is no impunity. Every day, more and more nations are coming to the same conclusion. With all the attention given to the prospect of limited military strikes against Syrian regime targets, I want to underscore that such action is by no means the sum total of our policy toward Syria. On the contrary, any such strikes would complement and reinforce our broader Syria strategy, which we continue to pursue with allies and partners. Our overarching goal is to end the underlying conflict through a negotiated, political transition in which Assad leaves power. The best way to achieve this is to keep the country and its institutions intact, but all parties have to be willing to negotiate. So ours is a multifaceted strategy that puts pressure on the regime by isolating them and denying them resources; builds up the civilian and military opposition; and secures diplomatic agreement with other key countries on the principles for transition while assisting those who need immediate relief. Thanks to the generosity of the American people, we lead the humanitarian effort to save lives, having provided the Syrian people more than $1 billion worth of food, shelter, medical assistance, clean water, and relief supplies. In fact, some of the medical supplies used to treat the victims at Ghouta came from the United States. We continue to upgrade and increase our support for moderate, vetted elements of the Syrian opposition in coordination with our international partners. We are building the capacity of local councils and helping civilian leaders to deliver essential services to those in need. We are helping the opposition better serve the needs of the Syrian people. And, we are expanding our assistance to the Supreme Military Council to strengthen its cohesion and its ability to defend against a repressive regime that kills civilians with abandon. Limited strikes that degrade Assad's capacity to use chemical weapons, and thus to kill on a horrific scale with impunity, can also shake his confidence in the viability of his relentless pursuit of a military solution. But, ultimately, the only sustainable way to end the suffering in Syria is through a negotiated political solution, starting with the creation of a representative transitional authority that organizes elections and meets the needs of the Syrian people. A ceasefire and a political solution are also, as a practical matter, the only way to eliminate completely the Syrian chemical weapons threat. That is why we continue to increase pressure on the Assad regime to come to the table and negotiate. Notably, during our discussions in St. Petersburg, we sensed more urgency among key players to bring the parties to the negotiating table to jump-start a political transition. The United States shares that sense of urgency, and our intention is to renew our push for the UN-sponsored Geneva process following any limited strikes. Just as limited strikes would complement our broader Syria policy, so too would they reinforce our broader Middle East strategy. The United States will not take sides in sectarian struggles. We cannot and will not impose our will on the democratic development of other nations. But, as President Obama has made clear, we can - and we will - stand up for certain principles in this pivotal region. We seek a Middle East where citizens can enjoy their universal rights; live in dignity, freedom and prosperity; choose their own leaders and determine their own future, free from fear, violence, and intimidation. Standing up to the Syrian regime's barbaric use of chemical weapons will affirm the most basic of principles: that nations cannot unleash the world's most horrific weapons against innocent civilians, especially children. And failing to stand up to these weapons could impel the Arab Spring towards an ever darker and more ominous turn. Rather, we seek a Middle East where violent extremism, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction do not threaten our allies, partners and Americans. We seek the stability of a region that is vital to the energy that helps fuel our global economy. Countering Syria's use of chemical weapons shows that the United States will act to prevent some of the worst weapons in human history from becoming the new norm. It will demonstrate that America means what we say. It will make clear to Assad and his allies-Hezbollah and Iran-that they should not test the resolve of the United States of America. This has implications for our efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The policy of the United States is clear: we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. With allies and partners, we continue to pursue a comprehensive strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including diplomacy, pressure, and increasing sanctions. And, as the President has said, all options remain on the table. For our efforts to succeed, however, the leaders in Tehran must know that the United States means what we say. If we do not respond when Iran's close ally, Syria, uses weapons of mass destruction, what message does that send to Iran? It risks suggesting that the international community cannot muster the will to act when necessary. It risks suggesting that serious threats to regional and global stability will be left to fester. It risks suggesting that egregious violations of international norms do not have consequences. Make no mistake, the decision our nation makes in the coming days is being watched in capitals around the world, especially in Tehran and Pyongyang. They are watching to see whether the United States will stand up for the world we are trying to build for our children and future generations. And, if we fail to act, they will be emboldened to push harder for the world that only they want-a future where more of the world's most dangerous weapons fall into the most dangerous hands. That is not the Middle East or the world that we seek. On the contrary, we seek a Middle East where Israelis and Palestinians live in two states, side by side, in peace and security. Yet, Assad's indiscriminate use of chemical weapons increases the possibility that they could someday be used against Israel and Palestinians. This only heightens the sense of vulnerability many in Israel feel about the turmoil that engulfs their nation, and it might make it even harder for Israelis and Palestinians to take the risks for peace. The bottom line is that standing up to Syria's use of chemical weapons advances our broader goals in the Middle East. Conversely, by allowing Assad to act with impunity, everything else becomes even harder-from countering terrorism to defending human rights, from promoting peace to ensuring our energy security and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In closing, allow me to speak, not just as the President's national security advisor, but also as a parent, a mother. Time and again, we have seen what happens when the world fails to respond to horrific abuses on the scale we saw in Damascus. We have seen the even greater barbarism that can follow, whether in Srebrenica or Rwanda or Darfur. I have been to more than my share of war zones. Each is horrible and uniquely tragic. But this most recent atrocity is particularly gut-wrenching. And unlike those tragedies of earlier decades, we have the technology-on our computers and our smart phones-to see the full horrors unfold in real time. Children lined up in shrouds, their voices forever silenced. Devastated mothers and fathers kissing their children goodbye, some pulling the white sheet up tight around their beautiful faces, as if tucking them in for the last time. There are no words of condemnation strong enough to capture such infinite cruelty. But where words may fail us, action must not. Every adult American, every Member of Congress, should watch those videos for themselves. See that suffering. Look at the eyes of those men and women, those babies-and dare to turn away and forsake them. Watch those videos, and imagine the months and years ahead where an emboldened Assad and those who follow his example carry out more attacks, forcing us to witness more and more such depravity. I believe you will come to the same conclusion as the President and so many countries around the world: that this cannot stand. Not in the 21st century. Not given the values and principles that we as Americans hold dear. As the one indispensable leader in the world, the United States of America can and must take action-carefully, responsibly, purposefully-to reduce the chances of such an outrage happening again.

I do not know how you guys are holding it together. I will begin by telling a hard truth: I am a Columbia College graduate. I know there can be a little bit of a sibling rivalry here. But I am honored nevertheless to be your commencement speaker today, although I have got to say, you set a pretty high bar, given the past 3 years. Hillary Clinton, Meryl Streep, Sheryl Sandberg, these are not easy acts to follow. But I will point out Hillary is doing an extraordinary job as one of the finest Secretaries of State America has ever had. We gave Meryl the Presidential Medal of Arts and Humanities. Sheryl is not just a good friend, she is also one of our economic advisers. So it is like the old saying goes: Keep your friends close and your Barnard commencement speakers even closer. There is wisdom in that. Now, the year I graduated--this area looks familiar----the year I graduated was 1983, the first year women were admitted to Columbia. Sally Ride was the first American woman in space. Music was all about Michael and the moonwalk. We had the Walkman---- No, no moonwalking. No moonwalking today. We had the Walkman, not iPods. Some of the streets around here were not quite so inviting. Times Square was not a family destination. So I know this is all ancient history. Nothing worse than commencement speakers droning on about bygone days. But for all the differences, the class of 1983 actually had a lot in common with all of you. For we too were heading out into a world at a moment when our country was still recovering from a particularly severe economic recession. It was a time of change. It was a time of uncertainty. It was a time of passionate political debates. You can relate to this because just as you were starting out finding your way around this campus, an economic crisis struck that would claim more than 5 million jobs before the end of your freshman year. Since then, some of you have probably seen parents put off retirement, friends struggle to find work. And you may be looking toward the future with that same sense of concern that my generation did when we were sitting where you are now. Of course, as young women, you are also going to grapple with some unique challenges, like whether you will be able to earn equal pay for equal work, whether you will be able to balance the demands of your job and your family, whether you will be able to fully control decisions about your own health. And while opportunities for women have grown exponentially over the last 30 years, as young people, in many ways you have it even tougher than we did. This recession has been more brutal, the job losses steeper. Politics seems nastier, Congress more gridlocked than ever. Some folks in the financial world have not exactly been model corporate citizens. No wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news does not get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore. Every day you receive a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message that suggest change is not possible, that you cannot make a difference, that you will not be able to close that gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be. My job today is to tell you, do not believe it. Because as thing--as tough as things have been, I am convinced you are tougher. I have seen your passion, and I have seen your service. I have seen you engage, and I have seen you turn out in record numbers. I have heard your voices amplified by creativity and a digital fluency that those of us in older generations can barely comprehend. I have seen a generation eager, impatient even, to step into the rushing waters of history and change its course. And that defiant, can-do spirit is what runs through the veins of American history. It is the lifeblood of all our progress. And it is that spirit which we need your generation to embrace and rekindle right now. See, the question is not whether things will get better; they always do. The question is not whether we have got the solutions to our challenges; we have had them within our grasp for quite some time. We know, for example, that this country would be better off if more Americans were able to get the kind of education that you have received here at Barnard, if more people could get the specific skills and training that employers are looking for today. We know that we'd all be better off if we invest in science and technology that sparks new businesses and medical breakthroughs, if we developed more clean energy so we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that is threatening our planet. We know that we are better off when there are rules that stop big banks from making bad bets with other people's money; when insurance companies are not allowed to drop your coverage when you need it most or charge women differently from men. Indeed, we know we are better off when women are treated fairly and equally in every aspect of American life, whether it is the salary you earn or the health decisions you make. We know these things to be true. We know that our challenges are eminently solvable. The question is whether, together, we can muster the will--in our own lives, in our common institutions, in our politics--to bring about the changes we need. And I am convinced your generation possesses that will. And I believe that the women of this generation--that all of you--will help lead the way. Now, I recognize that is a cheap applause line when you are giving a commencement at Barnard. It is the easy thing to say. But it is true. It is--in part, it is simple math. Today, women are not just half this country, you are half its workforce. More and more women are outearning their husbands. You are more than half of our college graduates and master's graduates and Ph.D.'s. So you have got us outnumbered. After decades of slow, steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny, but the destiny of this Nation and of this world. But how far your leadership takes this country, how far it takes this world, well, that will be up to you. You have got to want it. It will not be handed to you. And as someone who wants that future--that better future--for you and for Malia and Sasha, as somebody who is had the good fortune of being the husband and the father and the son of some strong, remarkable women, allow me to offer just a few pieces of advice. That is obligatory. Bear with me. My first piece of advice is this: Do not just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table. It is been said that the most important role in our democracy is the role of citizen. And indeed, it was 225 years ago today that the Constitutional Convention opened in Philadelphia and our Founders, citizens all, began crafting an extraordinary document. Yes, it had its flaws, flaws that this Nation has strived to protect * over time. Questions of race and gender were unresolved. No woman's signature graced the original document, although we can assume that there were founding mothers whispering smarter things in the ears of the Founding Fathers. I think that is almost certain. What made this document special was that it provided the space--the possibility--for those who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in. It provided people the language to appeal to principles and ideals that broadened democracy's reach. It allowed for protest and movements and the dissemination of new ideas that would repeatedly, decade after decade, change the world, a constant forward movement that continues to this day. Our Founders understood that America does not stand still. We are dynamic, not static. We look forward, not back. And now that new doors have been opened for you, you have got an obligation to seize those opportunities. You need to do this not just for yourself, but for those who do not yet enjoy the choices that you have had, the choices you will have. One reason many workplaces still have outdated policies is because women only account for 3 percent of the CEOs at Fortune 500 companies. One reason we are actually refighting long-settled battles over women's rights is because women occupy fewer than one in five seats in Congress. Now, I am not saying that the only way to achieve success is by climbing to the top of the corporate ladder or running for office. Although, let us face it, Congress would get a lot more done if you did. That I think we are clear about. But if you decide not to sit yourself at the table, at the very least you have got to make sure you have a say in who does. It matters. Before women like Barbara Mikulski and Olympia Snowe and others got to Congress, just to take one example, much of federally funded research on diseases focused solely on their effects on men. It was not until women like Patsy Mink and Edith Green got to Congress and passed title IX, 40 years ago this year, that we declared women too should be allowed to compete and win on America's playing fields. Until a woman named Lilly Ledbetter showed up at her office and had the courage to step up and say, you know what, this is not right, women are not being treated fairly, we lacked some of the tools we needed to uphold the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. So do not accept somebody else's construction of the way things ought to be. It is up to you to right wrongs. It is up to you to point out injustice. It is up to you to hold the system accountable and sometimes upend it entirely. It is up to you to stand up and to be heard, to write and to lobby, to march, to organize, to vote. Do not be content to just sit back and watch. Those who oppose change, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, have always bet on the public's cynicism or the public's complacency. Throughout American history, though, they have lost that bet, and I believe they will this time as well. But ultimately, class of 2012, that will depend on you. Do not wait for the person next to you to be the first to speak up for what is right. Because maybe, just maybe, they are waiting on you. Which brings me to my second piece of advice: Never underestimate the power of your example. The very fact that you are graduating, let alone that more women now graduate from college than men, is only possible because earlier generations of women--your mothers, your grandmothers, your aunts--shattered the myth that you could not or should not be where you are. I think of a friend of mine who is the daughter of immigrants. When she was in high school, her guidance counselor told her, you know what, you are just not college material. You should think about becoming a secretary. Well, she was stubborn, so she went to college anyway. She got her master's. She ran for local office, won. She ran for State office, she won. She ran for Congress, she won. And lo and behold, Hilda Solis did end up becoming a secretary. She is America's Secretary of Labor. So think about what that means to a young Latina girl when she sees a Cabinet Secretary that looks like her. Think about what it means to a young girl in Iowa when she sees a Presidential candidate who looks like her. Think about what it means to a young girl walking in Harlem right down the street when she sees a U.N. Ambassador who looks like her. Do not underestimate the power of your example. This diploma opens up new possibilities, so reach back, convince a young girl to earn one too. If you earned your degree in an area where we need more women, like computer science or engineering, reach back and persuade another student to study it too. If you are going into fields where we need more women, like construction or computer engineering, reach back, hire someone new. Be a mentor. Be a role model. Until a girl can imagine herself, can picture herself as a computer programmer or a combatant commander, she will not become one. Until there are women who tell her, ignore our pop culture obsession over beauty and fashion and focus instead on studying and inventing and competing and leading, she will think those are the only things that girls are supposed to care about. Now, Michelle will say, nothing wrong with caring about it a little bit. You can be stylish and powerful too. That is Michelle's advice. And never forget that the most important example a young girl will ever follow is that of a parent. Malia and Sasha are going to be outstanding women because Michelle and Marian Robinson are outstanding women. So understand your power, and use it wisely. My last piece of advice--this is simple, but perhaps most important: Persevere. Persevere. Nothing worthwhile is easy. No one of achievement has avoided failure--sometimes catastrophic failures. But they keep at it. They learn from mistakes. They do not quit. You know, when I first arrived on this campus, it was with little money, fewer options. But it was here that I tried to find my place in this world. I knew I wanted to make a difference, but it was vague how, in fact, I'd go about it. I--but I wanted to do my part to shape a better world. So, even as I worked after graduation in a few unfulfilling jobs here in New York--I will not list them all----even as I went from motley apartment to motley apartment, I reached out. And I started to write letters to community organizations all across the country. And one day, a small group of churches on the South Side of Chicago answered, offering me work with people in neighborhoods hit hard by steel mills that were shutting down and communities where jobs were dying away. The community had been plagued by gang violence, so as--once I arrived, one of the first things we tried to do was to mobilize a meeting with community leaders to deal with gangs. And I'd worked for weeks on this project. We invited the police, we made phone calls, we went to churches, we passed out flyers. The night of the meeting, we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of this crowd. And we waited, and we waited. And finally, a group of older folks walked in to the hall and they sat down. And this little old lady raised her hand and asked, Is this where the bingo game is? It was a disaster. Nobody showed up. My first big community meeting, nobody showed up. And later, the volunteers I worked with told me, that is it, we are quitting. They'd been doing this for 2 years even before I had arrived. They had nothing to show for it. And I will be honest, I felt pretty discouraged as well. I did not know what I was doing. I thought about quitting. And as we were talking, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street. And they were just throwing rocks up at a boarded building. They had nothing better to do--late at night, just throwing rocks. And I said to the volunteers: Before you quit, answer one question. What will happen to those boys if you quit? Who will fight for them if we do not ? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave? And one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit. We went back to those neighborhoods, and we kept at it, and we registered new voters, and we set up afterschool programs, and we fought for new jobs and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity. And we sustained ourselves with those small victories. We did not set the world on fire. Some of those communities are still very poor. There are still a lot of gangs out there. But I believe that it was those small victories that helped me win the bigger victories of my last 3 1/2 years as President. And I wish I could say that this perseverance came from some innate toughness in me. But the truth is, it was learned. I got it from watching the people who raised me. More specifically, I got it from watching the women who shaped my life. I grew up as the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends meet. She had marriages that fell apart, even went on food stamps at one point to help us get by. But she did not quit. And she earned her degree and made sure that, through scholarships and hard work, my sister and I earned ours. She used to wake me up when we were living overseas--wake me up before dawn to study my English lessons. And when I'd complain, she'd just look at me and say, This is no picnic for me either, buster. And my mom ended up dedicating herself to helping women around the world access the money they needed to start their own businesses; she was an early pioneer in microfinance. And that meant, though, that she was gone a lot, and she had her own struggles trying to figure out balancing motherhood and a career. And when she was gone, my grandmother stepped up to take care of me. She only had a high school education. She got a job at a local bank. She hit the glass ceiling and watched men she once trained promoted up the ladder ahead of her. But she did not quit. Rather than grow hard or angry each time she got passed over, she kept doing her job as best as she knew how and ultimately ended up being vice president at the bank. She did not quit. And later on, I met a woman who was assigned to advise me on my first summer job at a law firm. And she gave me such good advice that I married her. And Michelle and I gave everything we had to balance our careers and a young family. But let us face it, no matter how enlightened I must have thought myself to be, it often fell more on her shoulders when I was traveling, when I was away. I know that when she was with our girls, she'd feel guilty that she was not giving enough time to her work, and when she was at her work, she'd feel guilty she was not giving enough time to our girls. And both of us wished we had some superpower that would let us be in two places at once. But we persisted. We made that marriage work. And the reason Michelle had the strength to juggle everything and put up with me and eventually the public spotlight was because she too came from a family of folks who did not quit. Because she saw her dad get up and go to work every day even though he never finished college, even though he had crippling MS. She saw her mother, even though she never finished college, in that school, that urban school, every day making sure Michelle and her brother were getting the education they deserved. Michelle saw how her parents never quit. They never indulged in self-pity, no matter how stacked the odds were against them. They did not quit. Those are the folks who inspire me. People ask me sometimes, who inspires you, Mr. President? Those quiet heroes all across this country--some of your parents and grandparents who are sitting here--no fanfare, no articles written about them, they just persevere. They just do their jobs. They meet their responsibilities. They do not quit. I am only here because of them. They may not have set out to change the world, but in small, important ways, they did. They certainly changed mine. So whether it is starting a business or running for office or raising a amazing family, remember that making your mark on the world is hard. It takes patience. It takes commitment. It comes with plenty of setbacks, and it comes with plenty of failures. But whenever you feel that creeping cynicism, whenever you hear those voices say you cannot make a difference, whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower, the trajectory of this country should give you hope. Previous generations should give you hope. What young generations have done before should give you hope. Young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in, from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, did not just do it for themselves; they did it for other people. That is how we achieved women's rights. That is how we achieved voting rights. That is how we achieved workers' rights. That is how we achieved gay rights. That is how we have made this Union more perfect. And if you are willing to do your part now, if you are willing to reach up and close that gap between what America is and what America should be, I want you to know that I will be right there with you. If you are ready to fight for that brilliant, radically simple idea of America that no matter who you are or what you look like, no matter who you love or what God you worship, you can still pursue your own happiness, I will join you every step of the way. Now more than ever, America needs what you, the class of 2012, has to offer. America needs you to reach high and hope deeply. And if you fight for your seat at the table and you set a better example and you persevere in what you decide to do with your life, I have every faith not only that you will succeed, but that, through you, our Nation will continue to be a beacon of light for men and women, boys and girls, in every corner of the globe. So thank you. Congratulations. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentscommencementaddressbarnardcollegenewyorkcity", "title": "Barack Obama Commencement Address at Barnard College in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/commencement-address-barnard-college-new-york-city", "publication_date": "14-05-2012", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 873, "text": "I have reviewed the present fiscal situation with Secretary Mellon and Under Secretary Mills this morning, and I can state that there is no ground now for the anticipation that we shall not be able to continue the tax reductions over the next year. The indications of decreasing revenues and increasing expenses shown in the first 6 weeks quite properly furnishes a basis for calculations, but there are some administrative factors that have not been taken into account. The customs are temporarily lower because of anticipation of imports in advance of the passage of the tariff bill. Furthermore, we have been expediting the expenditure on construction work with view to giving maximum employment during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, in order that we might give the most work during the period of maximum unemployment. Further than that, these calculations take no account of the foreign debt payments which are likely to be very helpful this year. And they did not take into account the reduction in expenditure as the result of the drive we are making for the postponement--an actual reduction or economy--of such things as are not necessary at the present time. The reports of which are not in from all of the departments but so far as they have been received they indicate a probable cut of about $75 million in expenditure. One has to bear in mind in reducing the expenditure that about $2,200 million out of the $4,200 million of estimated expenditure this year is in respect to fixed charges for interest and debt redemption, pensions, et cetera. So that the field which we have to work in for economies is less than one-half of the total national expenditure. Out of that there is about $400 million of construction in one department or another, which we have been increasing rather than decreasing as a matter of employment, so that the field for revising expenditure for emergency is more limited on this occasion than most any other. I have an announcement to make for you, and that is that Mr. Henry p. Fletcher will be Chairman of the new Tariff Commission. He will take office at the expiration of the present commission, on September 16th. As you know, Mr. Fletcher has been in the Foreign Service of the Government for somewhere about 18 or 20 years. He has had to deal with economic and tariff matters in great numbers of aspects during this whole period. We will give you a little statement on his life and career, which I will not bother to read to you. Now, there is a little subject I would like to take up with you on purely personal grounds--not a matter for news or public discussion. Last night there was a story offered around Washington by one of the aviation companies for their own purposes, which very seriously reflected on the honor of ENTITY of the United States and his son. I wish to thank all of you for the fact that only two papers in the United States printed that story. I consider it as a most dastardly thing to have done. My boy, striving to make his way as an aviation engineer, is employed by two or three different aviation companies, some of whom are actual rivals in this competitive bidding. And there was no justification whatever for bringing the name of a radio engineer employed by aviation companies into a question of honor in connection with the letting of Government mail contracts. Those contracts have not been let to start with, but in any event, whether let or not, I have not in my experience in Washington seen anything so rotten in an attitude of the press towards President of the United States.Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference732", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-732", "publication_date": "22-08-1930", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Herbert Hoover"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 819, "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, you know, I really appreciate that lesson in history from the Vice President. I will tell you one thing you remember what John Nance Garner said about the Vice Presidency; he said it was not worth a warm what kettle of spit, or something like that. That is before Al Gore got ahold of it. Nobody will ever say that again ever, ever, ever say that again. And just for your information, George Clinton of New York, doubtless a relative of mine the only man in America ever to be the Governor of a State in excess of 20 years he served for 21 years as Governor of New York. He served 4 years and then laid out and served 17 years, until he became Vice President. And that is a pretty good record. It just sort of runs in the family, you know. I want to tell you all first to the White House staff and to all the appointees who are here; to the members of the Clinton/Gore campaign, from our wonderful campaign manager, Peter Knight, on down; and to the members of the people who work for our Democratic Party campaign. I want to say a special word of thanks to Don Fowler and Chris Dodd; they did a wonderful job, all the people at the party. To our terrific Cabinet over here on the left you know, they have labored for 4 years to uphold the dignity of our Government, and they sort of changed their image today. That picture of Warren Christopher in that T-shirt gets out he will be on Letterman and Leno within 48 hours. I thank you all so much. Last night I had a chance to do something really quite wonderful for me. I was able to have a meeting with when I was home in Arkansas with everybody who ever worked for me there at least we invited them all the people who worked for me 20 years ago when I was attorney general, the people who worked for me during all my five terms as Governor. And I told them something I want to tell you; that is, I have always been a very hard-working, kind of hard-driving person. I am always focused on the matter before me. Sometimes I do not say thank you enough. And I have always been kind hard on myself, and sometimes I think just by omission I am too hard on the people who work here. You have accomplished a phenomenal amount in the last 4 years, and you have proved that even in this vast country of ours, where the Government is only one part of our national partnership and billions upon billions of decisions are made every day by people who are not in our Government thank goodness we are primarily a country of free individuals with a free enterprise system but you have proved again something that was clearly in doubt in 1992 at election time. You have proved that with disciplined, sustained, focused effort, America can be changed for the better. You have proved that our problems are not all intractable. You have proved that we can galvanize the energies of the American people and that we can, in fact, bring the deficit down it is not a permanent feature of American life; we can, in fact, grow the economy on a sustained basis; we can, in fact, improve the education and the educational opportunities of our children; we can, in fact, lower the crime rate; and in fact, if people will help us enough in communities across the country, we can even help to change some of the very difficult cultural patterns that had begun to develop in our country over the last several years. You all did that. Very often, I get the credit for the work you do, and then when something goes haywire, if I make a mistake, you have to try to figure out how to clean it up. And I appreciate that. And I am sure I will give you other opportunities in the year ahead. I just want you to know, all of you, from the Cabinet to the staff, to the appointees, to all the others who are here, you should be very proud of this. This race was won because of the record we made and because of the plans we have and because we have established in the minds of the American people that it is more than talk with us, that we work at it hard every day. All of us, we work hard. And in the end that is what sustained us: a vision, a strategy, hard work, and success. And we have a lot more work to do. But when our work is done and when there is 8 years of sustained, disciplined effort, we will have gone a long way toward preparing our country for this new century. I cannot even imagine what the world is going to be like, but I try to imagine it all the time, 20 or 30 or 40 years from now. And we are lucky enough to just be here at a moment in history when it is our profound obligation to move the American people closer to what they believe by opening up new opportunities for people to live out their dreams, and when we have the opportunity to prove that we can actually reduce our problems. We have to keep working on that. We have got a lot to do. I talked a little about it last night. But I begin this new tenure with high opportunity and with renewed energy and with profound gratitude to the American people and to all of you. Two years ago, not many people thought we would be here. But I believed if we just kept doing the right things, kept trying to do them in the right way, and kept working hard and refused to be distracted by the things which dominate too much of our public life today, in the end the American people would render the right judgment. I am profoundly grateful for what they did last night and very, very grateful to all of you for making it possible.

{"id": 656, "text": "Thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, President Bush, President Carter, President Ford, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to acknowledge just a couple of other people who are in the audience because I think they deserve to be seen by America since you will be seeing a lot more of them: my good friend Bill Daley from Chicago and former Congressman Bill Frenzel from Minnesota, who have agreed to lead this fight for our administration on a bipartisan basis. Would you please stand and be recognized. It is an honor for me today to be joined by my predecessor, President Bush, who took the major steps in negotiating this North American Free Trade Agreement; President Jimmy Carter, whose vision of hemispheric development gives great energy to our efforts and has been a consistent theme of his for many, many years now; and President Ford, who has argued as fiercely for expanded trade and for this agreement as any American citizen and whose counsel I continue to value. These men, differing in party and outlook, join us today because we all recognize the important stakes for our Nation in this issue. Yesterday we saw the sight of an old world dying, a new one being born in hope and a spirit of peace. Peoples who for a decade were caught in the cycle of war and frustration chose hope over fear and took a great risk to make the future better. Today we turn to face the challenge of our own hemisphere, our own country, our own economic fortunes. In a few moments, I will sign three agreements that will complete our negotiations with Mexico and Canada to create a North American Free Trade Agreement. In the coming months I will submit this pact to Congress for approval. It will be a hard fight, and I expect to be there with all of you every step of the way. We will make our case as hard and as well as we can. And though the fight will be difficult, I deeply believe we will win. And I'd like to tell you why. First of all, because NAFTA means jobs, American jobs and good-paying American jobs. If I did not believe that, I would not support this agreement. As President, it is my duty to speak frankly to the American people about the world in which we now live. Fifty years ago at the end of World War II, an unchallenged America was protected by the oceans and by our technological superiority and, very frankly, by the economic devastation of the people who could otherwise have been our competitors. We chose then to try to help rebuild our former enemies and to create a world of free trade supported by institutions which would facilitate it. As a result of that effort, global trade grew from $200 billion in 1950 to $800 billion in 1980. As a result, jobs were created and opportunity thrived all across the world. But make no mistake about it, our decision at the end of World War II to create a system of global, expanded, freer trade, and the supporting institutions, played a major role in creating the prosperity of the American middle class. Ours is now an era in which commerce is global and in which money, management, technology are highly mobile. For the last 20 years, in all the wealthy countries of the world, because of changes in the global environment, because of the growth of technology, because of increasing competition, the middle class that was created and enlarged by the wise policies of expanding trade at the end of World War II has been under severe stress. Most Americans are working harder for less. They are vulnerable to the fear tactics and the averseness to change that is behind much of the opposition to NAFTA. But I want to say to my fellow Americans, when you live in a time of change the only way to recover your security and to broaden your horizons is to adapt to the change, to embrace it, to move forward. Nothing we do, nothing we do in this great capital can change the fact that factories or information can flash across the world, that people can move money around in the blink of an eye. Nothing can change the fact that technology can be adopted, once created, by people all across the world and then rapidly adapted in new and different ways by people who have a little different take on the way the technology works. For two decades, the winds of global competition have made these things clear to any American with eyes to see. The only way we can recover the fortunes of the middle class in this country so that people who work harder and smarter can at least prosper more, the only way we can pass on the American dream of the last 40 years to our children and their children for the next 40 is to adapt to the changes which are occurring. In a fundamental sense, this debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday. I tell you, my fellow Americans, that if we learned anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the governments in Eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot resist the winds of change that economics and technology and information flow have imposed in this world of ours. That is not an option. Our only realistic option is to embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow. I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the first 2 years of its effect. I believe if you look at the trends-and President Bush and I were talking about it this morning-starting about the time he was elected President, over one-third of our economic growth and in some years over one-half of our net new jobs came directly from exports. And on average, those exports-related jobs paid much higher than jobs that had no connection to exports. I believe that NAFTA will create a million jobs in the first 5 years of its impact. And I believe that that is many more jobs than will be lost, as inevitably some will be, as always happens when you open up the mix to a new range of competition. NAFTA will generate these jobs by fostering an export boom to Mexico, by tearing down tariff walls which have been lowered quite a bit by the present administration of President Salinas but are still higher than Americas'. Already Mexican consumers buy more per capita from the United States than other consumers in other nations. Most Americans do not know this, but the average Mexican citizen, even though wages are much lower in Mexico, the average Mexican citizen is now spending $450 per year per person to buy American goods. That is more than the average Japanese, the average German, or the average Canadian buys; more than the average German, Swiss, and Italian citizens put together. So when people say that this trade agreement is just about how to move jobs to Mexico so nobody can make a living, how do they explain the fact that Mexicans keep buying more products made in America every year? Go out and tell the American people that. Mexican citizens with lower incomes spend more money-real dollars, not percentage of their income-more money on American products than Germans, Japanese, Canadians. That is a fact. And there will be more if they have more money to spend. That is what expanding trade is all about. In 1987, Mexico exported $5.7 billion more of products to the United States than they purchased from us. We had a trade deficit. Because of the free market, tariff-lowering policies of the Salinas government in Mexico, and because our people are becoming more export-oriented, that $5.7 billion trade deficit has been turned into a $5.4 billion trade surplus for the United States. It has created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Even when you subtract the jobs that have moved into the maquilladora areas, America is a net job winner in what has happened in trade in the last 6 years. When Mexico boosts its consumption of petroleum products in Louisiana-where we are going tomorrow to talk about NAFTA-as it did by about 200 percent in that period, Louisiana refinery workers gained job security. When Mexico purchased industrial machinery and computer equipment made in Illinois, that means more jobs. And guess what? In this same period, Mexico increased those purchases out of Illinois by 300 percent. Forty-eight out of the 50 States have boosted exports to Mexico since 1987. That is one reason why 41 of our Nation's 50 Governors-some of them who are here today, and I thank them for their presence-support this trade pact. I can tell you, if you are a Governor, people will not leave you in office unless they think you get up every day trying to create more jobs. They think that is what your job is if you are a Governor. And the people who have the job of creating jobs for their State and working with their business community, working with their labor community, 41 out of the 50 have already embraced the NAFTA pact. Many Americans are still worried that this agreement will move jobs south of the border because they have seen jobs move south of the border and because they know that there are still great differences in the wage rates. There have been 19 serious economic studies of NAFTA by liberals and conservatives alike; 18 of them have concluded that there will be no job loss. Businesses do not choose to locate based solely on wages. If they did, Haiti and Bangladesh would have the largest number of manufacturing jobs in the world. Businesses do choose to locate based on the skills and productivity of the work force, the attitude of the government, the roads and railroads to deliver products, the availability of a market close enough to make the transportation costs meaningful, the communications networks necessary to support the enterprise. That is our strength, and it will continue to be our strength. As it becomes Mexico's strength and they generate more jobs, they will have higher incomes, and they will buy more American products. We can win this. This is not a time for defeatism. It is a time to look at an opportunity that is enormous. Moreover, there are specific provisions in this agreement that remove some of the current incentives for people to move their jobs just across our border. For example, today Mexican law requires United States automakers who want to sell cars to Mexicans to build them in Mexico. This year we will export only 1,000 cars to Mexico. Under NAFTA, the Big Three automakers expect to ship 60,000 cars to Mexico in the first year alone, and that is one reason why one of the automakers recently announced moving 1,000 jobs from Mexico back to Michigan. In a few moments, I will sign side agreements to NAFTA that will make it harder than it is today for businesses to relocate solely because of very low wages or lax environmental rules. These side agreements will make a difference. The environmental agreement will, for the first time ever, apply trade sanctions against any of the countries that fails to enforce its own environmental laws. I might say to those who say that is a giving up of our sovereignty: For people who have been asking us to ask that of Mexico, how do we have the right to ask that of Mexico if we do not demand it of ourselves? It is nothing but fair. This is the first time that there have ever been trade sanctions in the environmental law area. This ground-breaking agreement is one of the reasons why major environmental groups, ranging from the Audubon Society to the Natural Resources Defense Council, are supporting NAFTA. The second agreement ensures that Mexico enforces its laws in areas that include worker health and safety, child labor, and the minimum wage. And I might say, this is the first time in the history of world trade agreements when any nation has ever been willing to tie its minimum wage to the growth in its own economy. What does that mean? It means that there will be an even more rapid closing of the gap between our two wage rates. And as the benefits of economic growth are spread in Mexico to working people, what will happen? They will have more disposable income to buy more American products, and there will be less illegal immigration because more Mexicans will be able to support their children by staying home. This is a very important thing. The third agreement answers one of the primary attacks on NAFTA that I heard for a year, which is, Well, you can say all this, but something might happen that you cannot foresee. Well, that is a good thing, otherwise we never would have had yesterday. I mean, I plead guilty to that. Something might happen that Carla Hills did not foresee, or George Bush did not foresee, or Mickey Kantor or Bill Clinton did not foresee. That is true. Now, the third agreement protects our industries against unforeseen surges in exports from either one of our trading partners. And the flip side is also true. Economic change, as I said before, has often been cruel to the middle class, but we have to make change their friend. NAFTA will help to do that. This imposes also a new obligation on our Government, and I am glad to see so many Members of Congress from both parties here today. We do have some obligations here. We have to make sure that our workers are the best prepared, the best trained in the world. Without regard to NAFTA, we know now that the average 18-year-old American will change jobs eight times in a lifetime. The Secretary of Labor has told us, without regard to NAFTA, that over the last 10 years, for the first time, when people lose their jobs most of them do not go back to their old job; they go back to a different job. So that we no longer need an unemployment system, we need a reemployment system. And we have to create that. And that is our job. We have to tell American workers who will be dislocated because of this agreement, or because of things that will happen regardless of this agreement, that we are going to have a reemployment program for training in America. And we intend to do that. Together, the efforts of two administrations now have created a trade agreement that moves beyond the traditional notions of free trade, seeking to ensure trade that pulls everybody up instead of dragging some down while others go up. We have put the environment at the center of this in future agreements. We have sought to avoid a debilitating contest for business where countries seek to lure them only by slashing wages or despoiling the environment. This agreement will create jobs, thanks to trade with our neighbors. That is reason enough to support it. But I must close with a couple of other points. NAFTA is essential to our longterm ability to compete with Asia and Europe. Across the globe our competitors are consolidating, creating huge trading blocs. This pact will create a free trade zone stretching from the Arctic to the tropics, the largest in the world, a $6.5 billion market with 370 million people. It will help our businesses to be both more efficient and to better compete with our rivals in other parts of the world. This is also essential to our leadership in this hemisphere and the world. Having won the cold war, we face the more subtle challenge of consolidating the victory of democracy and opportunity and freedom. For decades, we have preached and preached and preached greater democracy, greater respect for human rights, and more open markets to Latin America. NAFTA finally offers them the opportunity to reap the benefits of this. Secretary Shalala represented me recently at the installation of the President of Paraguay. And she talked to Presidents from Colombia, from Chile, from Venezuela, from Uruguay, from Argentina, from Brazil. They all wanted to know, Tell me, is NAFTA going to pass so we can become part of this great new market-more, hundreds of millions more of American consumers for our products. It is no secret that there is division within both the Democratic and Republican Parties on this issue. That often happens in a time of great change. I just want to say something about this because it is very important. Are you guys resting? I am going to sit down when you talk, so I am glad you got to do it. I am very grateful to the Presidents for coming here, because there is division in the Democratic Party and there is division in the Republican Party. That is because this fight is not a traditional fight between Democrats and Republicans and liberals and conservatives. It is right at the center of the effort that we are making in America to define what the future is going to be about. And so there are differences. But if you strip away the differences, it is clear that most of the people that oppose this pact are rooted in the fears and insecurities that are legitimately gripping the great American middle class. It is no use to deny that these fears and insecurities exist. It is no use denying that many of our people have lost in the battle for change. But it is a great mistake to think that NAFTA will make it worse. Every single solitary thing you hear people talk about, that they are worried about, can happen whether this trade agreement passes or not, and most of them will be made worse if it fails. And I can tell you it will be better if it passes. So I say this to you: Are we going to compete and win, or are we going to withdraw? Are we going to face the future with confidence that we can create tomorrow's jobs, or are we going to try against all the evidence of the last 20 years to hold on to yesterday's? Are we going to take the plain evidence of the good faith of Mexico in opening their own markets and buying more of our products and creating more of our jobs, or are we going to give in to the fears of the worst-case scenario? Are we going to pretend that we do not have the first trade agreement in history dealing seriously with labor standards, environmental standards, and cleverly and clearly taking account of unforeseen consequences, or are we going to say this is the best you can do and then some? In an imperfect world, we have something which will enable us to go forward together and to create a future that is worthy of our children and grandchildren, worthy of the legacy of America, and consistent with what we did at the end of World War II. We have to do that again. We have to create a new world economy. And if we do not do it, we cannot then point the finger at Europe and Japan or anybody else and say, Why do not you pass the GATT agreement; why do not you help to create a world economy? If we walk away from this, we have no right to say to other countries in the world, You are not fulfilling your world leadership; you are not being fair with us. This is our opportunity to provide an impetus to freedom and democracy in Latin America and create new jobs for America as well. It is a good deal, and we ought to take it.

{"id": 821, "text": "Louis, Governor Thomson, distinguished guests. At the very beginning, let me apologize for being late. We have had just unbelievable crowds beginning in Keene and running all the way across the State, west to east. I just appreciate, beyond any words that I can express, my gratitude for your patience, your understanding, and your warm and hospitable reaction to our coming in at this time. This trip to New Hampshire has been a great lift, and it has been a lift because I am convinced that the people of New Hampshire are interested in having their election decided by them and not by the politicians in Washington, D.C. It was my privilege to come to your State Capitol in April and to urge at that time that the right answer was by the people and the wrong answer was by the politicians in the Nation's Capital. You have that opportunity now. You have probably the greatest opportunity to make a decisive decision next Tuesday. I am proud to be here on behalf of a friend of mine, Louis Wyman, but I am equally proud to be in the great State of New Hampshire because I am here representing, along with others, a unified party, a party that is working together on behalf of Louis Wyman's election. Governor Thomson, last night Governor Reagan, earlier today and he may be here now Senator Norris Cotton, Congressman Jim Cleveland was with us all I am trying to say is we have presented a unified front because we think it is a crucial election. I am delighted to see Ruth Griffin here who so ably represents your area, and she, like all of us, is standing steadfast on behalf of Louis Wyman. Let me ask you or tell you, if I might, why we stand together. Why are we interested in the election of Louis Wyman? Louis Wyman believes in a strong national defense with the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines first and not second best, and that is important to the maintenance of peace throughout the world. Secondly, related to that, you have got a great naval installation here in Portsmouth one that is very significant from the national security point of view, one that is a very vital part of the economy of this part of New Hampshire. Let me speak very strongly that Louis Wyman in 1964 and again in 1972 almost single-handedly kept the Portsmouth Navy Yard open so we could have that' facility here defending or helping to defend the peace throughout the world. Let me add, you elect Louis and he will have an opportunity to continue that strong support for this great navy installation which is such an integral part of our national security forces. I do not have to tell all of you in New Hampshire that Louis, by actions, by words, is working hard to keep control of government at the local level. He knows and I know that we cannot run the city of Portsmouth nearly as well from Washington as your elected officials can do it right here in Portsmouth. So, if you want local control with locally elected officials and the backup given to Lou that is necessary, then you ought to elect Louis Wyman on next Tuesday. I would like to conclude a wonderful day, and it started early and it is ending late, but it has been an inspiration to me to meet so many old friends, to make so many new acquaintances. Fortunately, a long time ago I used to come to New Hampshire then to vacation and ski, and I met some wonderful people who have been my friends over the years, and the characteristics of those people I have found in my opportunity to see others in New Hampshire today are independence, dedicated, with great conviction. You have the kind of characteristics which I think are reflected in Louis Wyman. If you want an independent guy, a man of dedication with deep convictions, I urge you to make that extra step to get to the polls on Tuesday. One final word: All of you have close friends who you would stand up for, who you would urge to be appointed or elected. Louis Wyman is that kind of a friend of mine. I am here spending this wonderful day because I want to go the last mile supporting a person who I respected as a legislator, who I admire as a person, who I know will do the job best for the State of New Hampshire, and I know will help me the most as we face the critical, crucial problems of energy, the economy, jobs, inflation, and all the other things. Louis, I want to urge you to make the maximum effort, and I want your literal thousands of friends here in New Hampshire to join in supporting me in supporting you. Good luck. Thank you very, very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksportsmouthnewhampshire0", "title": "Remarks in Portsmouth, New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-portsmouth-new-hampshire-0", "publication_date": "11-09-1975", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

{"id": 826, "text": "I love you back. Buenas noches! Well, it is good to be here. Thank you, Secretary Castro, not just for the introduction, but for the great work he is doing on behalf of the American people every single day. Thank you to your chair, Linda Sanchez, for her outstanding leadership in the Congress. Thank you to all of you for having me here tonight. Thank you! I'd like to begin my remarks with a story. I love you too! But look, I have got to tell you this story here. So on an evening about 75 years ago, in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, a young man proposed to the woman of his dreams. Any of us who've done that and I have know at that moment he was feeling pretty nervous. And fortunately for him, she said yes. And because apparently he was making the kind of money I was making when I proposed to celebrate, they went to a hot dog stand. Things were simpler back then. But things took a wrong turn. Authorities suddenly pulled up, lined them up, patted them down, demanded to see their IDs, just because they were Mexican American. And when the young man handed over his wallet, the officer pulled the cards out of it and just dropped them on the sidewalk, and then he said, Now you pick them up. I remember getting on my knees and picking them up, that young man said decades later. And we can imagine his fear and his humiliation. What had been a beautiful day had suddenly become an example of occurrences that were happening far too often. And imagine how easy it would have been for him at that moment to turn to despair and to allow the anger and the resentment to feed a cynicism and for him to decide that America could never change. But that young man was named Ed Roybal. And Ed Roybal never lost faith in himself or in his country. And less than 25 years after he was brought to his knees on the streets of Los Angeles, Ed stood under the Capitol Dome to represent those very same streets in the Congress of the United States of America. He dedicated his life to the idea that America can change, that our Union can become more perfect. And today, his legacy lives on not only in the legislation he passed and the improvements he made in his district, but also in his daughter Lucille, who is here tonight. And he helped start the Congressional Hispanic Caucus because he knew that we are stronger together than we could ever be alone. And that is the same reason I ran for this office 8 years ago, not because I believed in what I could do, but because I believed in what we could do together. The financial crisis had not even hit yet, and we came to understand it was going to make our job a lot harder. But thanks to the members of the Hispanic Caucus, thanks to people like Nancy Pelosi who is standing here tonight thanks to the determination and fundamental optimism of the American people, we have made progress. When I took office, the unemployment rate was on its way to 10 percent. Today, it is 5.1 percent. The unemployment rate among Latinos hit 13 percent, and we have brought that down to 6.4 percent. When I took office, we were losing about 800,000 jobs a month. Today, our businesses have created jobs for a record 67 months in a row, more than 13 million new jobs overall. When I took office, more than 15 percent of Americans, including nearly one in three Hispanics, lacked health insurance. Today, we have covered another 17 million Americans, including 4 million Latinos, and only 9.2 percent of Americans are uninsured. For the first time on record, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance. For the first time ever, insurance companies cannot discriminate against anybody with a preexisting condition. When I took office, we were still too often stuck in a cold war mentality that began before many of us were even born. And today, for the sake of our people, and our entire hemisphere, we have reestablished relations with Cuba, we have turned the page on the failed policies of the past. We have strengthened our relationship with Latin America. We have put forward a plan to invest $1 billion in our shared security and prosperity in Central America. When I took office, hardworking young people Americans in every way but on paper lived in constant fear of deportation. Today, more than 680,000 DREAMers live and study and work freely and openly in the country they have always called home. We have got smarter enforcement priorities, because it makes no sense to focus on separating families when we can be going after felons instead. We are taking new steps to reach out to folks who are eligible to become citizens and attract immigrant entrepreneurs and educate STEM students. We are going to help more husbands and wives of American citizens get their green cards without separating them from their families. And the deferred action policies I announced last year will help millions of mothers and fathers remain in the United States of America with their families, and although it is taking us longer than we hoped, I know we are on the right side of the law, and we are going to keep fighting to prove it. And we have not won every battle. We have still got a lot more work to do. But when the cynics told us we could not change our country for the better, they were wrong. There are more job openings today than at any time in our history. The high school dropout rate is near the lowest on record, and Latino students are making some of the fastest gains. More Americans are graduating from college. The deficits are down by two-thirds. The amount of foreign oil we buy is down. Teen pregnancy is down. Which all of which makes you wonder: Why are some of the folks who are running for my office so down on America? Well, no, I am definitely not doing that. But by most measures, we are better off now than we were 7 years ago. And that we know. Of course, none of it comes up in their debates. I mean, they have invented this new reality where everything was terrific back in 2008 when the unemployment and uninsured rates were rising and DREAMers lived in fear of deportation and we were engaged in two wars and bin Laden was still at large. That was the golden era, apparently, the good old days. And then, I came along and messed it all up. And now when you listen to them, you still do not know what they are for except turning back the clock on the work that we have done together: repealing Obamacare, gutting Wall Street reform, allowing power plants to pollute the air our children breathe. And there is nowhere where they want to go further backwards than on immigration. It was not that long ago that my predecessor, George W. Bush, a Republican a conservative Republican from Texas, with whom I disagreed with on a whole lot of things, made immigration reform one of his core priorities. We cannot build a unified country, he said, by inciting people to anger or playing on anyone's fears or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain. That is what he said. Think how much better our economy would be if the rest of his party got the message. Think about how much better off our country would be if Republican politicians had not spent years precisely trying to scare voters with tales of immigrants flooding across our borders and taking our jobs and destroying America as we know it, even though we know that when you look at what is happening at the borders, it is the lowest rates of immigration that we have seen since the 1970s. A clear majority of Americans, including a lot of Republican voters, support reform. That is one of the reasons we got a bipartisan bill through the Senate in 2013. But now some of the very same Republican politicians who championed reform in the past some of whom sponsored these efforts suddenly, they want nothing to do with it. Hmm. In these circumstances, I always say, do not boo, vote. They cannot hear the boos, but they can hear your vote. But the point is, that is not leadership: turning against what is right the moment the politics of your base gets tough. Leadership is not fanning the flames of intolerance and then acting all surprised when a fire breaks out. Saying clearly inflammatory things and then saying, well, that is not what I meant until you do it again and again and again. So we have got to decide whether or not we, as Americans, are willing to stand up against this kind of bigotry that the same cruel impulse that Ed Roybal spent a lifetime fighting against. The anti-immigrant sentiment that has infected our politics is not new, but it is wrong. It was directed at Irish folk. It was directed against Italians. There have been generations of immigrants that have been subject to this same kind of attitude, with some of the same stereotypes. It was not right then; it is not right now. And unless you were one of the First Americans unless you are Navajo or Cherokee somebody somewhere came from someplace else. I believe we need an immigration system that is fair and orderly and lawful. I believe that people who come here illegally should have to pay a fine and pay their fair share of taxes and get registered and get right with the law and go to the back of the line before they earn citizenship. But when I hear folks talking as if somehow those kids are different from my kids, as if they are less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow their families are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, as if somehow back in the day, everybody had their papers in order when they came here, but now suddenly, nobody has their papers in order I believe we are better than that. If you want to be taken seriously as a leader, you cannot just be against everything. You have got to be for something. You cannot just feed on fear. You should be feeding hope. You should be for fixing our immigration system. You should be for allowing DREAMers and their parents, who have been here for years, to live without fear in the country they love. You should tell the truth, which is that illegal border crossings are lower than they have been in decades and that economists agree that immigration does not hurt our economy, it grows our economy, creating jobs, raising wages for Americans. You do not hear those facts very often, but those facts those are facts. And you have got to recognize that America's greatness does not come from building walls. Our greatness comes from building opportunity. Our greatness comes from building an economy that works for everybody. Our greatness comes from a dream that says in this country, if you work hard, you can build a better life for your family. No matter where you come from. No matter what you look like. No matter what your last name is. That is what makes America great. So I am going to spend every day that I have left in this office fighting to restore that dream so that everyone who works hard can get ahead. And, yes, that includes immigration reform. But that is not all that we have got to do. We have got to keep creating good jobs. We have got to make sure every family feels our country's recovery in their own lives, and that includes the families in Puerto Rico. We have got to make 2 years of college as free and universal as high school is today. We have got to stop spending billions of taxpayer dollars keeping nonviolent drug offenders behind bars and give them a chance to get right and back on the right track. We have got to make sure that every child gets a world-class education from an earliest age, that every person who is still uninsured gets covered, that every school and every street is safe from the madness of gun violence. And this change will not be easy because change never is. Change is never easy. It takes longer than 1 year. It takes longer than one term. It takes longer than the tenure of one President. But what we together have shown and proven is that when we stick together and put our shoulders to the wheel of history, not only is change possible, change is inevitable. America can change. And if we keep dreaming of something better and organizing for something better, if we keep voting for something better, together we are going to build on the progress we have made. We are going to create a brighter future for our children. Si, se puede. Juntos podemos! Thank you, CHC thank you, CHCI. Que Dios los bendiga.

{"id": 990, "text": "Mr. Ambassador, Mrs. Ghorbal, Your Excellencies, and ladies and gentlemen: Nancy and I are delighted to welcome you here tonight. It is a great pleasure to have this chance to meet with you more as friends than as representatives of our countries, more for passing a pleasant evening than transacting business. It is inspiring to look around this room, to think of the many languages, cultures, religions, and traditions that are present here tonight. Some might say this gathering is a microcosm of the problems that the world faces but to me this gathering is a sample of the opportunities we have to communicate on a personal level and to cooperate as representatives of our independent nations. This room is occupied by men and women aware of their responsibilities and respectful of the obligations of others. Those responsibilities and obligations are at times in conflict, but our commitment to civility and the proper discourse between nations should never waiver. Today's diplomats shoulder a tremendous burden, but the effort is reminiscent of Antilles, the character in Greek mythology, who drew his strength from the Earth: So long as he touched the Earth, he could not be defeated, but when he lost touch, he grew frail. As long as our governments stay in touch with the hopes and aspirations of our people, the prospects for world peace will be strong. Beneath our diversity, the peoples of the world have similar goals. They look for dignity, peace, freedom, and a chance to prosper. These common dreams will be the source of our strength. George Santayana, an American traveler and philosopher, once said, A man's feet must be planted in his country, but his eyes should survey the world. Well, this is the vision required of each of us and of every world leader. We must uncompromisingly represent the interests of our countries, yet be ever mindful that by our actions, we are determining the future of mankind. If I may, I would present to you the same words with which I would challenge an assembly of American diplomats: In the conduct of your duties, be diligent; in the search for peace, be bold. The people of the world owe a special debt of gratitude to diplomats and their families, who today must cope not only with the frustrations inherent with the profession, but also with personal danger. In the last 15 years, diplomats from over a hundred countries have been victims of terrorist attacks. Fortunately, most have survived those attacks; a few, tragically, have not. Those who perpetrate these dastardly acts should never doubt that every nation considers an attack on any diplomat as a crime against mankind which will not be tolerated in any land. Reflecting on this, we are grateful to the diplomatic community for your courage and your perseverance. So, since there is no one of us that will be toasted separately, I ask you now to raise your glasses with me in a toast in honor of the Washington Chiefs of Missions: May mankind profit by what we do. Now, do not break the glasses in the fireplace.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoastwhitehousedinnerhonoringthechiefsdiplomaticmissions", "title": "Toast at a White House Dinner Honoring the Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toast-white-house-dinner-honoring-the-chiefs-diplomatic-missions", "publication_date": "11-02-1982", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 928, "text": "Hello, Colorado! It is good to be back in Grand Junction. Love Grand Junction! It was about 4 years ago, around this time, that I was first in Grand Junction. We had a bunch of bales of hay. You remember that? Everybody was nice. Weather was a little warm. And it is great to be back. I have got a couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, please give DeAnne a big round of applause for the great introduction. And I am a little sweet on Deanne, not just because of a great introduction, but also because she is a nurse, and I just love nurses because they do such a great job every day. Also, we have got one of your outstanding U.S. Senators, Michael Bennet, in the house. There he is. And one of your former Senators, who is now doing an outstanding job looking after the natural resources of this great country of ours: Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Now, those of you who have a seat, feel free to take a seat. Those of you who do not , just remember to bend your knees because sometimes I have people drop off in the middle of even when I am not talking too long, just because they have been standing too long. So especially when it is warm like this. I love you back. Who was that? I do. Now, obviously, this is a smart crowd, and so I know that most of the last couple of weeks, you have been watching the Olympics, cheering on our U.S. athletes over in London. You have been spending time with family and trying to get outdoors, at least when it cools off. But unless you have been able to hide the television completely or your cable is broke, then you may be aware there is a pretty intense campaign going on right now. And the reason it is such an intense campaign is because the choice that we face in November could not be bigger. This is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties. It is a choice about two fundamentally different visions for the country, two fundamentally different paths. And the direction that we choose the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in less than 3 months is going to have a direct impact not just on our lives, but on the lives of our children and our grandchildren for decades to come. Now, 4 years ago, we came together Democrats, but also Independents and some Republicans to restore the basic bargain that had built this country, that had made us the most prosperous nation on Earth. And it is a very simple bargain. It says, if you work hard, your work will be rewarded. It says that if you put in enough effort, you can find a job that pays a decent wage, pays the bills; that you can afford to have a home that you call your own; that you have health care you can count on when you get sick; that after a lifetime of labor, you can put away enough to retire with dignity and respect; and most importantly, that you can give your kids the kind of education and opportunity that allows them to dream even bigger and do even better than you could ever imagine. That is the promise of America. That is the promise of America. Now, when we came together, we knew restoring that bargain that deal, that compact was not going to be easy. We knew it would take more than one year or one term or maybe even one President, because because we had seen what had happened in the previous decade. Jobs had moved overseas. Folks were working harder and harder, but their wages or incomes, they were staying flat, sometimes even going down. The cost of everything from health care to college was going up. And then, it all culminated in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and our neighbors of jobs, the value of their homes, their savings. And all that pushed the American Dream even further out of reach for too many working people. But you know what, we have spent the last 3 1/2 years digging ourselves out of that hole. We averted a depression, created 4.5 million new jobs, 500,000 in manufacturing. We saved an auto industry. We made sure that we worked to make college more affordable. We worked to make sure that health care was secure for families. And what we discovered during the course of these difficult times is that a crisis does not change our character. It does not change who we are as a people. It does not change what makes us great: our toughness, our grit, our resilience, and our ability to come together and work together on behalf of this country. And when we came together in 2008, we understood that there is a core decency, that there is a goodness to the American people, and we need to make sure that that is reflected in what happens in Washington. And our mission has never been more urgent. So, after 3 1/2 tough years, we are still going. We are here to build an economy where hard work pays off, so that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from, here in America, you can make it if you try. That is what this campaign is about, Colorado. And that is why I am running for a second term as President of the United States of America. Now, understand, there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to some of these challenges. But here is the thing that I constantly am reminded of wherever I travel across the country: We have the capacity to meet any challenge, because we have still got the best workers in the world. We have got the best entrepreneurs in the world. We have got the best scientists and researchers in the world and the best colleges and the best universities in the world. We are still a young nation, and we have got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity, and people want to come here from every corner of the globe. And so no matter what the naysayers tell us, no matter how dark the other side tries to make things look, the fact is, there is not another country on Earth that would not gladly trade places with the United States of America. So we can solve our problems. What is standing in our way is not that we do not have good ideas or we do not have solutions to problems like energy independence or improving our schools. What is standing in our way is our politics. You have got a bunch of folks in Washington who think the only way is their way and who think that the only way to go forward is to go right back to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. They believe in the old top-down economics that we spent an entire decade trying and that did not work. And look, I am not exaggerating here. My opponent, Mr. Romney, and his friends in Congress, when you look at their economic ideas, when you look at, you know, they have spent a lot of time on commercials, saying how there are not enough jobs and the economy is not growing fast enough. And then, you ask them, okay, well, what is it that you are thinking about doing? And you know, I am not exaggerating, it boils down to two things. First of all, they want to give more tax cuts to folks at the very top. Five trillion dollars' worth of tax cuts on top of the Bush tax cuts. And then so that is idea number one. Idea number two is let us get rid of regulations that we put into place to make sure that Wall Street does not misbehave again and we do not have another meltdown or getting rid of regulations that help protect our air and our water or getting rid of regulations that protect consumers from unscrupulous lenders. That is their basic idea. You get rid of regulations, and you cut taxes for wealthy Americans, and somehow, jobs and prosperity will all rain down on all of us. This is the path they are proposing. If you think I am exaggerating, you go to their websites, you look at the bills that have been passed by this House of Representatives. That is where they will take us if they win. In fact, the centerpiece of Mr. Romney's entire economic plan is this new $5 trillion tax cut. And now I want you to pay attention here; we are going to do a little math. I know it is not everybody's favorite subject, but math is important. I like that; somebody said they love math. There you go. All right, so we have known for a while that a lot of this new $5 trillion tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of all households. But last week, an independent nonpartisan organization crunched the numbers. They looked, what does this mean, $5 trillion? Keep in mind, by the way, the defense budget is about $500 billion. So a $5 trillion tax cut is over 10 years is like a tax cut that is as big as our entire defense budget every single year. All right? So these guys were trying to analyze what does this mean. They found that Governor Romney's plan would raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of $2,000. Now, the reason is as he says that this $5 trillion tax cut he will pay for by doing other things, by slashing education or making Medicare into a voucher. But even after he makes all the cuts to education and training and science and research and transportation and environmental protection, you name it, it turns out, he is still short. So the only way that you could actually pay for it is to have you pick up the bill. So you would then pay $2,000 extra every year not to reduce the deficit, not to help our kids get an education, not to rebuild our roads and our bridges or lay broadband lines into rural communities. He would ask the middle class to pay more in taxes so he could give another $250,000 to people making more than $3 million a year. Now, he was asked about this, his campaign was asked about it, and if this sounds like an idea that would be difficult to explain to the American people, you are right. Let us just say there was a whole different kind of gymnastics being performed by Mr. Romney than what is been happening in the Olympics. So they were twisting, and they were turning and doing backflips and trying to say, well, this is a biased report, despite the fact that the head of this nonpartisan center used to work for President Bush. But it is not surprising that he was trying to scramble a little bit, because they have tried to sell this old, trickle-down tax cut fairy dust before. And you know what, it did not work then. It will not work now. It is not a plan to create jobs. It is not a plan to lower the deficit. It is not a plan to move our economy forward. It is not a plan to build the middle class. We do not need more tax cuts for folks like me. We need tax cuts for working Americans who are trying to raise a family and keep our families healthy and send our kids to college and keep a roof over their heads. That is who needs some help. That is the choice in this election, and that is why I am running for President: to fight for you. Now, you guys still bending your knees? All right. You have got some water; get hydrated. Michelle made me promise that I cannot sing to others anymore. Because she wants me to just sing to her, you know? But look, Grand Junction, I have got a different plan for America. Their ideas are not going to work. Four years ago, I promised to cut middle class taxes. That is exactly what I have done. The typical family has seen their taxes go down by about $3,600. So when you talk to your friends or neighbors and they say, he is a big, spending, tax-raising Democrat you have got to tell them, no, actually, if you are in the middle class, your taxes have gone down. So now I want to keep taxes exactly where they are for the first $250,000 of everybody's income. So if your family makes under 250,000 which, by the way, 98 percent of Americans do, 97 percent of small businesses do you will not see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year. That is my plan. And by the way, I have told Congress I told the Republicans in Congress I said, let us do it now. You guys say you do not want to see anybody's taxes go up; I do not want to see anybody who is making $250,000 or less see their taxes go up. Let us go ahead and sign a bill. But shockingly enough they have not agreed so far, because they are holding you guys hostage to try to get tax cuts for the top 2 percent. Now, look, if you are fortunate enough to be in the other 2 percent of Americans, you are still going to get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of your income. So if you make 260,000, the first 250, you are still keeping all that tax cut. It is just that little bit over 250. Now, if you are making $5 million, you can afford it. Right? All we are asking for folks who have been blessed like me I mean, I am not being self-interested here. It is not like I love paying taxes, but I understand I have got certain obligations because this country has been so good to me. So what I have all we are saying is for folks in the top 2 percent, let us go back to what we were paying under Bill Clinton. Let us contribute a little bit more so we pay down our deficit and we can still invest in things like education that help our kids succeed. Now, keep in mind, just in case you are talking to your friends or neighbors again and they say, well, that just a little bit of tax increase on the top 2 percent, that will not cut the deficit, they are right. We have got to do more. So we have already cut a trillion dollars. Federal spending is growing at a slower rate than any time since Dwight Eisenhower. I will make sure Government continues to do its part, and we will cut out spending we do not need. But I am not going to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires by gutting investments that have always made us strong as a country. And by the way, just like we tested their plan under the previous administration and it did not work, we have tested my plan because, as you will recall, under Bill Clinton, when those taxes were a little bit higher on folks like me, the economy grew faster than it has in years, 23 million new jobs. We went from a deficit to a surplus. And folks at the top did well. We created a lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason is that, look, when a construction worker has a got a little money in his pocket, now he starts thinking about buying a new car. When a teacher has security in her job, now she might go to a restaurant once in a while. And so what happens is, when the middle class is strong, suddenly, businesses have more customers, businesses have more profits, businesses decide to hire more workers. Everybody does well. That is how we build a strong economy, not from the top down, from the middle out, from the bottom up. That is the choice in this election. That is why I am running for a second term for President of the United States. Now, let me say, you can see how this plays out on a whole bunch of issues, not just taxes and the deficit. When the American auto industry was on the brink of collapse, more than 1 million jobs at stake, Governor Romney says, let us let Detroit go bankrupt. I said let us bet on American workers. And the American auto industry has come roaring back. So now I want to make sure that the jobs of tomorrow, including advanced manufacturing jobs, that they are not taking root in China or Germany. I want them to take root in Colorado, in Ohio, in Michigan. Governor Romney and I have a different theory. He spent his private sector experience investing in companies that were called pioneers of outsourcing. I want to insource. I want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Let us give those tax breaks to companies that are investing in Colorado, investing in Grand Junction, hiring American workers, selling American products, stamping those goods with three proud words: Made in America. That is what I believe. Mr. Romney says it was tragic for me to end the war in Iraq, like I promised. I think after a decade of war, it is time to do some nation-building here at home. Thanks to the incredible service of our men and women in uniform, Iraq is in charge of its own destiny. We are bringing troops home from Afghanistan. We went after bin Laden and Al Qaida, and we got them. So now let us take half of the savings that we were spending on war, and let us use it to put people back to work rebuilding schools, rebuilding bridges, rebuilding roads, improving our airport systems, improving our ports so that we can move goods and services that will make our economy strong not just now, but in the future. And by the way, that also helps us pay for providing services that our men and women in uniform have earned. Our veterans fought too hard for us for them to have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home. That is a sacred trust we have got to keep. I am running to make sure America once again leads the world in educating our kids. I want to hire new teachers, especially in math and science. Help 2 million people go to community colleges to train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now. And I want to make sure that every young person can afford to go to college. We have already expanded student aid; now we need to bring tuitions down. That is why I am running for President: to give our young people a chance. On every issue, there is a difference. On housing and foreclosures, Mr. Romney says let the market just bottom out. I say let us let every American refinance their homes at historically low rates, save $3,000 per family, per homeowner. That could actually boost the economy and strengthen the housing market. When it comes to health care, he wants to kill Obamacare. I am implementing Obamacare because it was the right thing to do. Already, as we speak, 6.5 million young people under the age of 26 can stay on their parent's plan. Millions of seniors have saved hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs, and we are closing the doughnut hole. Individuals and businesses are getting rebates from their insurance companies because insurance companies have to use most of the money they get in premiums to provide care, not for CEO bonuses and administrative costs. If your child has a preexisting condition, insurance companies cannot turn them down. Soon, adults who have preexisting conditions cannot be turned down. So if that is what Mr. Romney wants to get rid of, despite the fact that he did the same thing in Massachusetts and it worked pretty well then that is a different that is a choice in this election. You know, I do not think we should be refighting some of the battles he wants to refight. I think it was the right thing to do to end do not ask, do not tell. I think you should be able to serve your country no matter who you are. I do not think it makes sense for us to take away control that women have over their own health care decisions. But most of all, most of all, I want to make sure that that original bargain that made this country great, that basic idea that if you work hard you can make it, that that is restored. And everything we do from health care to education, to manufacturing, to our infrastructure, to our investment in science and research all of this is designed to make sure that we have got a strong middle class going forward, that no matter what you look like, where you come from, that everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. That is the same promise our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents believed in. And now we have got to pass on that same promise to the next generation. Now, over the last over the next 3 months 89 days, to be precise the other side will be spending more money than we have ever seen. You have got these guys writing $10 million checks. You have got these super PACs that are just going crazy. And now, here is the thing. I do not know why they are running all these ads, because basically, they only have one ad. It is just a variation on the same ad, which is, the economy is not where it should be and it is ENTITY's fault. That is their basic argument. Because they know they cannot sell their actual plans; they do not have plans. Their message is designed to try to win an election, but it is not a plan to create jobs. They do not have a plan to grow the economy. They do not have a plan to revive the middle class. But I do. And so when you are talking to your friends and your neighbors, and they say, well, I do not know, Mr. Romney, he ran a business and I think maybe that might work, look, if you believe that trying what we already tried and it did not work is worth trying again, if you believe it is okay to cut taxes for folks who are doing really well and ask folks who are struggling to do more, if you think it is okay for us to cut back on our investments in education and science and set our sights lower, then their that is your choice. That is how our democracy works. Try it out. But you know what, if you believe that we are on the right track if you think like I do that we have come too far to turn back now then I am going to need you, Colorado. We have got too many good jobs to create. We have got too many good teachers to hire. We have got too many great schools to build. We have got too many students we need to help go to college. We have got too much homegrown clean energy to generate. We have got more troops to bring home. We have got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody who is willing to work hard, to walk through that door. We have got to leave something behind for the next generation so they can do even better, so they can do even bigger than we ever imagined. That is what is at stake. That is why I am running. And if you are willing to stand with me and if you still believe in me just like I believe in you, we will win, Colorado. We will win this election. We will finish what we started. And we will remind the world why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkscampaignrallygrandjunctioncolorado", "title": "Barack Obama Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Grand Junction, Colorado", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-rally-grand-junction-colorado", "publication_date": "08-08-2012", "crawling_date": "01-07-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 837, "text": "Your Excellency Archbishop Cooke, Vice President Humphrey, Vice President and Mrs. Nixon, Governor and Mrs. Rockefeller, Mayor and Mrs. Lindsay, Governor Hughes, Governor Dewey, Senator Javits, Senator Goodell, distinguished Members of Congress, Mr. Silver, Mrs. Warner, Mrs. Morrison, ladies and gentlemen. I was sitting here this afternoon thinking that whoever put this head table together should really be our President. Because I can tell you that we could use a good consensus politician in the White House. This is the first time that I have heard of Armistice Day being celebrated in October. Of course, you all remember, we call it Veterans Day now but you could still fool me with some of the old campaigners who are here tonight. Even so, I do not think any veteran could appreciate my feelings on this night except maybe General Custer. And I do not know of any chief Executive or otherwise who has ever been surrounded by so many Indians. It kept me awake all last night. Finally, around 4 a.m. this morning, the ghost of Al Smith appeared at my bedside. He said, ENTITY, I have seen the guest list for that dinner, too, and I cannot sleep either. Then Al Smith gave me a tip. He told me to handle you like he had once handled another audience. Soon after his first election as Governor of New York, Al Smith went to visit the State prison at Sing Sing. He was asked to speak to the inmates, but he did not know quite how to start or what to say. Finally, he began, My fellow citizens. Then he was reminded that to be a guest of the State's prison meant that you were no longer a citizen. So AL Smith was even more embarrassed. Then he said, My fellow convicts. That did not sound quite right either, so Governor Smith then waved his arms in a grand gesture and said, Well, anyhow, I am glad to see so many of you here. That is my salutation to all of you for now. But as the resident prisoner of the big white jailhouse, I do anticipate the very great pleasure of saluting one of you soon with the greeting, Fellow convict. I am so honored to have the pleasure of being here with my good friend, His Excellency, Archbishop Cooke, tonight. Although-looking at the company he is keeping I was tempted to lean over and ask him, Are not you really in the wrong pew? I resisted the temptation because of the ecumenical nature of this gathering. To be completely fair, I would have then had to put the same question to Governor Rockefeller or Mayor Lindsay. I can just see Al Smith sitting up there tonight with St. Peter maybe even with Herbert Hoover chuckling at all the secret thoughts of this head table when they look over at Archbishop Cooke: Mr. Nixon, of course, is hoping that the Archbishop has come here to witness a resurrection. He appears to be so confident these days that he is already planning to change the name of Washington, D.C., to Resurrection City. Vice President Humphrey is moving a little closer all the time. He is sitting here hoping that the Archbishop perhaps will pass the collection plate a second time. He even suggested to me as I came in that I use my good offices to ask another little favor of the Archbishop just a small miracle of loaves and fishes. Governor Rockefeller is sitting over there smiling and thinking, Well, they almost got me to the church on time. Mayor Lindsay, to his left and our left, always looking far ahead, is offering up a slightly different prayer, Get me to the church. Get me to the church next time. There is only one man missing tonight from this very happy scene. I think it is a shame, Your Excellency, that Gene McCarthy has refused to come to church. He has chosen to go off and fast in the desert instead. I am happy to say, however, that we have another famous American here to console us. He is an immigrant son who has made good so good that tonight his name is almost a household word. We are all proud of Spiro Skouras.1 These days, my friends, I also find myself saying on occasions a nonpartisan prayer. Watching the race from the sidelines, I remember a story that Lincoln once told after he became President. It concerned the man who had once stood right up on the gallows before he got a last-minute reprieve. A year later he was on the way to the gallows again for another crime, and he rode in a slow-moving wagon while hundreds of townspeople rushed to get a front seat at the ceremony. The prisoner stuck his head out of the wagon and shouted, You needn't be in such a hurry, boys. I have been there-and there will not be any fun until I get there. Well, I have been there. I will not say that I will be sorry to leave there to leave it to one of you candidates, but I will say this: This could be my last press conference. Pretty soon you will not have Lyndon Johnson to kick around any more. But I am very grateful that I could be here in this company tonight. I do appreciate more than I can say the statements of warmth and welcome by Mayor Lindsay and Governor Rockefeller, the very generous references by Vice President Nixon, and the constancy and devotion of Vice President Humphrey. I want to keep my comments as nonpartisan as possible, so I will include you, Mr. Archbishop, in that final benediction. Just the other day one of our foremost newspapers quoted some of those famous inside sources to charge that a certain important archdiocese suffered from government by crony. Well, as I have said before, These are the New York Times that try men's souls. In all seriousness, my friends, it is a great honor to appear at this traditional charitable dinner in honor of that great American, Al Smith, a dinner that was sponsored so long and so faithfully and so well by that great American, Francis Cardinal Spellman. The men and women who are here tonight to support the philanthropic efforts of the Archdiocese of New York know the voice of suffering they know that good men must work and good men must care if we are to have a just society. So, tonight we can look back 8 years, when Vice President Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared at this dinner. We can all recall how Americans who cared about the poor and the black and the culturally deprived were very much out of the mainstream. We know how dramatically and, I think, how profoundly times have changed. Our country has changed and the world is changing. Tonight, tens of millions of Americans are deeply concerned about the welfare of the less fortunate fellow citizens. Tonight, most all Americans care. That itself, I think, is a great accomplishment. I would only leave you both the candidates and the citizens with one thought. The cause of those deprived and discriminated against is not a cause that can be abandoned or exploited or maligned by any man or party. Their cause and their problems cannot be kicked under a rug or run over by a car. Not if you want America to survive. Not if you want American democracy to remain alive and to remain meaningful. Yes, there can be and there is legitimate difference about the tactics used to help the poor among us. But one tactic can never be acceptable: that the problem be pasted over by those in either public or private positions of great influence and responsibility; that resources and answers be left only to a few dedicated Americans, to charity, to the kind of people who are gathered here tonight because, I am proud to say, you care about America, and you demonstrate it by your presence. The goals of private philanthropy can only be reached by broad-based public concern all across America. I am glad to believe that Americans care tonight. And all of us must continue to care. And whichever of you gentlemen is elected, I know and I believe and I hope and I pray that you will see to that commitment.

{"id": 758, "text": "Lieutenant Governor Mutz, Mayor Hudnut, Congressman Myers, thank you, and thank all of you. And a special thanks to your outgoing president, John Horsley, for inviting me here. And I want all of you to know that it is good to be back in Indiana, and it is good to once again speak to the National Association of Counties. To tell you the truth, though, I figure that in addressing some 4,000 fellow public officials I have got to be on my toes. And come to think of it, giving a speech to so many speechgivers reminds me of a story. And it has to do with a fellow that was the only living survivor or left alive years later of the Johnstown flood. And he made quite a thing out of public speaking. He was in great demand at luncheon clubs and so forth to tell of the experiences of having gone through that terrible thing, the Johnstown flood. Well, his time came, and there he was facing St. Peter. And as he entered heaven, St. Peter said, You know, if you have got anything special that you'd like to talk about from down on Earth, people up here like to hear things from back there. Oh, he said, yes. He said, I do have. I have been speaking for a long time. And, well, St. Peter said, That will be just fine. And he told him what he'd been doing. So, he led him into an auditorium, and here it was packed and jammed. And St. Peter told them a newcomer from Earth was there and had an interesting story to tell them. And then as he introduced him and turned away and whispered when he went past him and said, That fellow with the beard on the aisle in the front row his name is Noah. But I come to you today with immense respect and respect for the hundreds and hundreds of, well, people that are here and I was told how many were here, 4,000, so I'd better say that instead of the hundreds. But I come before you today with immense respect and respect for the offices you hold so close to the people themselves respect for your service to our nation at the most basic levels of our democracy. You know many of your constituents by face and by name. And you preside at commission and board meetings, where they voice their concerns. You know what it is to be stopped on the street to explain a decision. In recent years, you have worked imaginatively to increase private economic development in your communities the best way to ensure economic growth. And day in and day out, you know what it is to be held responsible for government actions. You know what it is, in short, to do the will of the people. This is why I want to enlist you in the campaign that I began on the 3d of July on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial. There I called on all Americans to complete the work of the authors of the Declaration of Independence with an Economic Bill of Rights, a bill that will restore to us the freedoms that our Founding Fathers believed we should always have, a bill of rights that will protect us and future generations from the needless and wrongful encroachment of government upon our lives. For make no mistake, the danger is grave. And many in Congress are intent upon returning to the days of unrestrained and irresponsible government present company, I might add, is excepted. I know which side Governor Myers or Congressman Myers is on. Consider, for example, the so-called budget process. Delay after delay, missed deadline after missed deadline the entire budget process looks like intentionally staged chaos, chaos to provide a cover for those in Congress whose aim is to shift resources from the people's interest to the special interests. Indeed, a recent article in the Washington Post described how one member of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee circulated a bill asking well, it was to fill in the blanks, and the form was asking other members to sign up for their favorite pork-barrel project. And according to the Post, few could resist grabbing-quote a piece of the action. Now, I have spoken before about this congressional urge to grab a piece of the action, but this is so important for you and all the American people to understand that I'd like to give you examples. To begin with, there is the highway bill with its massive demonstration projects that give more of the funds to a few, hand-picked areas. This approach deprives you of the necessary resources to return Federal dollars to places where they are really needed. I vetoed that bill earlier this year. By one vote, Congress managed to override my veto. Why? Well, in part, so that Congress could allow a certain major city to add an extension to its mass transit system. The system will be so expensive, and for so few people, that it would be cheaper to buy each rider a new car every 5 years for the next half a century. Also part of the highway bill, Congress chose to spend $870 million for the continued construction of a subway system in a major city on the west coast. The city is in sound economic condition, could have financed the construction independently, but perhaps the really remarkable part of it all is that the route of the subway is still undetermined. Eight hundred and seventy million in a hole in the ground, and where it comes out, nobody knows. I could go on and on. There is the Federal program that will spend millions to build luxury hotels, restaurants, and condominiums-that is right, fancy condominiums. I barely had time to figure out what yuppies were before Congress started to subsidize them. There are the farm programs that provide little or nothing for the many family farms, but that gave one wealthy farmer more than $13 million and that gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Texas landowner who is neither American nor in need of public assistance. He is the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein. But there is one program Congress recently voted on that pretty much says it all. This year the Congress of the United States, in its deep and unfathomable wisdom, voted 8 million of your tax dollars to establish get ready a center for the study of weeds. Now, I do not know whether I want to know any more about weeds. But you know, there are some days sitting in that Oval Office, with these bills coming across my desk, when I do not know whether to laugh or cry. Now, I have been accused in recent days of campaigning for our Economic Bill of Rights in order to distract attention from other events in Washington. Well, it so happens that I have been campaigning for economic rights for more than three decades, and I intend to go on doing so for years to come. But more important, the truth is just the other way around. There are those who would like to distract attention from the real business of government: putting an end to unrestrained spending. And I am convinced that the great majority of Americans believe simply this: Stop the spending, and no more taxes. And while I am getting a few things off my chest, something else has been bothering me lately. Critics have claimed that in opposing our administration on the issues, they are at some kind of an unfair disadvantage, that this Presidency is somehow based more on personality than on policy. Well, the truth is, no President can remain popular unless he retains the fundamental support of the American people on the issues. So, I invite my critics I welcome my critics to go after me on the issues just as hard as they please. We will let the people decide who is right and who is wrong. It all reminds me about Senator Gore of Oklahoma a story told back in the early 1900's. Gore was both blind and a fiery orator. And one day an opponent of his in the Senate, stung by Gore's criticism, took to his feet and shouted, If you were not blind, I'd beat you to within an inch of your life. And Senator Gore simply responded, Blindfold the so-and-so, and point him in my direction. Tax hikes, budget-busting spending bills, job-destroying protectionism, a new round of soaring inflation the momentum in Washington is building. As I have said since the beginning of this campaign, today virtually all that stands between us and a return to the malaise economy of the 1970's is the Presidential veto. And to make this point so clear that Congress cannot possibly understand me, permit me once again to repeat my commitment. As far as I am concerned, our tax reform for the American people is, to borrow the title of the current hit movie, untouchable. And if any tax hike ever comes across my desk, my handling of the veto pen will make the way Elliott Ness went after Al Capone look like child's play. But important as the Presidential veto power may be, we dare not rely upon it alone. No, we need more to protect the hard-won achievements of these past 6 years. And it is for this reason to protect our prosperity and our jobs, to promote more growth and opportunity that I have proposed our Economic Bill of Rights. Listen for a moment to the specific provisions and Congress, take notice. The people are entitled to the fruits of their labor and shall not be burdened by excessive taxation. What does this mean? It means that more than a mere majority of the Congress should be required to raise taxes not just 50 percent plus one, maybe 60 percent, maybe two-thirds. I know when I was Governor of California it took twothirds of the legislature to pass the budget, and it took 60 percent of the voters to pass a bond issue. They have cried out in fright in Washington as if I have suggested something unconstitutional with regard to raising taxes. The future of succeeding generations shall not be mortgaged to the national debt through deficit spending. The Congress shall be required to balance the budget each and every year. Special interest legislation shall not be hidden from the people. The President shall have the right to veto individual appropriations. The President shall have the line-item veto. I used it 943 times when I was a Governor, and I miss it in Washington. The people are entitled to pursue their own livelihood, free from excessive regulation and tax-subsidized competition. I will appoint a Presidential commission to spearhead efforts to privatize public-owned enterprises. Educational development, creativity, and initiative will be fostered by diversity in our educational system. Welfare programs must not harm the structure of family and community. Through the use of incentives, the Congress will seek to lift the least fortunate to independence and full participation in American life and economy. Free and fair trade will be encouraged. The Congress shall pass no measure that slows growth, shrinks markets, or destroys jobs by erecting high tariffs or other trade barriers. The Government shall take seriously the 5th and 14th amendment guarantees to life, liberty, and property. Whenever government expropriates the use or value of private property, whether outright or through government regulations, owners will be justly compensated. The burden of government shall not be hidden from view. The Congress shall require that a financial impact statement accompany each bill, specifying the economic growth, employment or the effect on economic growth and employment, and competition overseas. There will be truth in Federal spending. At last, Congress will specify how every single new program is to be paid for. These last two points, truth in Federal spending and the requirement for a financial impact statement, bear directly upon your work as county officials. For in recent years, Congress has not been satisfied with just spending hundreds of billions of Federal funds. Congress has wanted to spend still more money, including the funds of State and local governments. You all know how it works. The Federal Government appropriates millions for this or that program, then mandates that you participate in the program by spending millions of your own dollars or by complying with certain national standards to avoid the loss of Federal funds. In all this, mandates is just a fancy word for big government in Washington pushing around the levels of government that are closest to the people. Under our proposals, whenever Congress considered legislation that would impose costs on State and local governments, a statement of those costs would appear in the legislation itself, not buried in some obscure committee report. Still more significant, Congress would be required to state what they expect the impact to be on State and local governments and where the funds would come from, not leave it to local officials like you to explain to your constituents why you are forced to raise taxes because of something that happened in Washington. These simple measures would force the Federal Government to do what it should have been doing all along: take federalism seriously and treat State and local governments with respect. Now, all that sounds good to me, but you are the one whose opinions count. So, let me ask you: Is not it high time Washington put its own house in order and stopped pushing you around? Respecting economic rights may prove painful for some, but doing so is of fundamental importance to the future of our nation. For to limit economic freedom is to impair economic growth. Look at the history of our own times. Socialist countries seem to experience some economic malaise precisely to the extent that they are Socialist. And in the Communist world, we see economic stagnation, material backwardness of every kind. Yes, in concentrating on it all but exclusively, the Soviet Union has been able to build its military into a formidable force. But ask yourself this: When was the last time you bought a car or there are some other things there even a good cheese or a videocassette recorder and the label read, Made in the U.S.S.R. ? In our own nation, too, we have recent examples that prove how important it is for government to respect economic rights. Consider the Federal income tax. No property is more private, no property is more personal, even intimate, than an individual's income. It directly represents the labor, day-in and day-out, of one's mind and hands. It is used for the necessities of life itself, to provide for one's family, to make possible the adventure of building a better life. Yet during the 1970's, the Federal Government showed a high-handed disregard for this most fundamental form of property, taxing it at higher and higher levels, permitting inflation to raise effective tax rates again and again. Well, our administration changed all that. We cut tax rates, indexed tax brackets, then simplified the entire tax system with our historic tax reform. And the result? The connection between effort and reward was reestablished, giving virtually every participant in our economy new incentives for achievement. Today unemployment stands at the lowest rate in almost 8 years. Government revenues at the Federal level and for most State and local governments have actually gone up. The stock and bond markets have risen to record highs. And come this Thanksgiving, this tax cut-led expansion if it is still going on on Thanksgiving Day will go into the books as the longest peacetime expansion ever to take place in this nation. And perhaps most important, we have seen the creation of more than 13 million new jobs. Yet all that we have achieved our hard-won victory over inflation, the millions of new jobs all these are in danger. It is our duty to protect them, to secure for ourselves and our children the economic rights that will enable our nation, now and into the 21st century, to become a still greater land, a land of ever-increasing prosperity and ever-widening opportunity. In this bicentennial year of our Constitution, I submit to you that we see in the vision of the Founding Fathers and in the Constitution itself the promise of a government that is good, because it respects its citizens' rights, both political and economic, and that has chosen once and for all to live within its own means. And now I ask you to join me; join me, my friends, in making that promise come true. I cannot conclude without telling another little story here. I have got a new hobby. I am collecting stories that I can find are told by the people of the Soviet Union, among themselves, which shows a great sense of humor, but also a certain cynicism about their way of life. And when I mentioned socialism a few moments ago, I thought to myself I wanted to tell you this story about their system and their economy. The story has to do with a fellow buying a car over there. You have to wait 10 years, if you are a Soviet citizen, for an automobile. You have to put the money down and then sign all the papers and go through all the departments, and then you wait for 10 years to get your car. Well, they tell the story about a fellow who was doing this and finally got to the last place, stamped the paper, signed up, put down his money, and the man in charge said, Well now, come back in 10 years and get your automobile. And he said, Morning or afternoon? And the man said, Well, what difference does it make 10 years from now? .... Well, he said, the plumber's coming in the morning. Well, by the way, those who tell you that we have deficits because we cut the income taxes you might be interested to know that at the lower rates of our income tax, by 1985 our tax program did not really go into effect until 1983 by 1985, our income tax revenues were $44 billion bigger than they had been in 1941 at the higher rates. So, with that, join us, and let us get an Economic Bill of Rights. And thank you all, and God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheannualconventionthenationalassociationcountiesindianapolisindiana", "title": "Remarks at the Annual Convention of the National Association of Counties in Indianapolis, Indiana", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-annual-convention-the-national-association-counties-indianapolis-indiana", "publication_date": "13-07-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 972, "text": "Thank you all for coming. Thanks for the warm welcome. Please be seated. My arm still hurts from the last time or one of the last times I came to St. Louis. I tried to fire a 90-mile-an-hour fastball on opening day got up there about 60, maybe. But I love coming to your town. Thanks for having me. Thank you all. Those of you who have traveled I want to thank those of you who traveled from outside this great city of St. Louis to come to support Talent. The Show Me State my attitude is, show me a good Senator, and I am going to back him. And we have got a great Senator in Jim Talent. I appreciate his spirit. I appreciate his working with the White House. He is an independent enough guy to tell us if we are not doing right. In other words, he is the kind of person you want from a State of strong, independent people: Tough, principled, unwilling to yield when he stands for when he believes he is correct. And that is the way Jim Talent is. Every time I am with him, he is always talking about the citizens of Missouri. I say, What about Texas? He says, Well, they are all right down there. So I am proud to stand here with him. And I think the people of Missouri will be wise to send this good man back to the United States Senate. And Talent married well Brenda, I appreciate you being here. It is good to meet your mother-in-law. It is a smart thing to bring the mother-in-law through the photo op line. Not only is he a good Senator, he is a smart son-in-law. I was also thrilled to meet Michael and Kate and Chrissy, Jim and Brenda's children. See, what is important to the Talents is putting their family first. That is what I like about Jim Talent. He is got his priorities absolutely straigh faith, family, and the United States of America. He married well, and so did I. And Laura sends her love to all our friends here in Missouri. You might have noticed that she is become quite a comedienne. More importantly, she is a great First Lady. I was proud of her trip recently to the Middle East. She is sending a strong message as part of the freedom movement, and that is, you cannot be free unless women have a free role in society. So not only is she a great comedienne, she is a great diplomat. But more importantly, she is a wonderful mother, wonderful wife, and a great First Lady for the United States. And I want to thank the senior Senator. That is appropriate to call you senior, but you are a little older than Talent, at least. Kit Bond has served this State with great distinction for a long time. He is a great friend and a great man. I appreciate you being here, Kit, and his wife, Linda Bond. And I am proud of your Governor. It still amazes me that you are old enough to meet the age requirement. He is the youngest looking Governor in America. It turns out he is a young-looking man who can get a lot done. And I appreciate your leadership in the statehouse, Matt. Good job. And the Lieutenant Governor is with us, Pete Kinder. I have known Pete a long time, and I appreciate your serving, Pete, and joining Matt and making this State be all that it can be. I want to thank Congressman Kenny Hulshof as well, and his wife, Renee. Kenny is a bright star in the House of Representatives from the great State of Missouri. I love talking to Kenny. He is a thoughtful fellow. Every time I see him he says soybeans. I thank Mike Gibbons and his wife, Liz. Mike is the State senate president pro tem. I want to thank Rod Jetton, the speaker of the statehouse, and his wife, Cassie. Thank you all for coming. I want to thank all of you all who serve. Somebody told me they thought Ambassador Danforth would be here tonight. I hope so. I do want to say that he represented our country so well. Jack, thanks for coming, and thanks for serving. Thanks for serving so admirably in the United Nations. As well, thanks for taking on a tough assignment. I asked Jack Danforth from the State of Missouri to help resolve the Sudan civil war, the conflict between north and south. And unfortunately, Darfur has obscured the great progress that Ambassador Danforth made on behalf of peace. And when it is all said and done, Jack, your contribution to helping solve that problem will go down in history as one of the great humanitarian gestures by our country, led ably by you. Thank you, sir. I want to thank all the folks who helped put on this fundraiser. It is an incredibly successful evening and which speaks not only to your hard work but also to the admiration that your Senator has earned by the people of Missouri. We have got a lot to do in Washington. One of the things I like about Talent is he understands that our job in Washington is to confront problems, not pass them on to future Congresses. In my case, to confront problems and not pass them on to future Presidents. That is our job. That is what the American people expect from those of us who have been elected. And we have got some problems we got to solve. Now, we dealt with one of our problems, and that is our economy. We had some tough times for a while because of the enemy attack and the down cycle of our economy. I do not know if you know this or not, but in the last 2 years, we have added over 3.5 million new jobs. More Americans are working today in our country than in the Nation's history. And I appreciate the fact that Jim understands we cannot rest, that the job of Government is not to create the wealth but an environment in which people are willing to risk capital, an environment in which there is a reasonable chance for America to stay competitive in the world. And one way to do that is to make sure we finally get an energy policy out of the United States Congress. When I first got to Washington, I recognized that our country was too dependent on foreign sources of energy. And so I went to the Congress and said, Here is a strategy that will encourage more conservation, a strategy that will use research and development dollars to make it more likely we will have more renewable sources of energy, a strategy that says we can explore for oil and gas in environmentally friendly ways in America, a strategy that recognizes we need to use nuclear power, a strategy that says we need clean coal technology, a strategy that says we can use soybeans to refine biodiesel. It is a smart strategy. But it is been stuck. There is too much politics in Washington, DC. It is been stuck. They got it out of the House, and thanks to Jim Talent's leadership and Kit Bond's leadership, they are going to get a good bill off the Senate floor. I am going to sign a bill. For the sake of national security and for the sake of economic security, Congress needs to get me a good energy bill by the recess, by the summer recess break this year. Jim Talent knows what I know: Smart policy will enable us to grow out of our hydrocarbon society, which we are going to have to do. I went to a refinery in Virginia the other day it is an unusual kind of refinery; it is a refinery that refines biodiesel and saw a new C.A.T. engine that can burn 100 percent biodiesel with no exhaust. See, technology is going to enable us to diversify away from our old habits, which will be good for our country, good for our economy. And the United States Congress can help that diversification process through wise policy. Jim Talent understands that, and I am going to keep pushing hard to make sure the rest of the United States Senators understand that. I appreciate the fact that we passed a good, tough budget out of the United States Senate. I hope you appreciate that as well. We have got to show the people of this country that we can be wise about how we spend your money. Notice I did not say the Government's money how we spend your taxpayers' money. And so I said to them, Here is a way to cut our deficit in half, meet our priorities, but it requires fiscal discipline. And I want to thank Jim Talent for his understanding that you cannot be all things to all people when it comes time to spending the taxpayers' money. You have to set priorities. You have to have goals, and you must show fiscal discipline. We passed a good budget. I am looking forward to working with this good Senator to make sure the appropriation process stays stuck to the budget. I am also working on Social Security for a reason. The reason is, is that there is a huge problem looming for a younger set of Americans. I just came from Hopkinsville, Kentucky Hopkington, Kentucky, and I told the people there what I have been telling folks all across the country, that if you get your check, you have nothing to worry about. I mean, the Social Security system is just fine for people receiving their check. But because baby boomers like me are getting ready to retire see, my retirement age shows up at 2008 which is a convenient year. But the problem for younger workers is there is more than just me retiring. There is a whole slew of us called baby boomers. As a matter of fact, about 73 million of us are set to retire. To put that in perspective, there is something like 42 million retirees today. And I do not know about the rest of you baby boomers here, but I plan on living longer than the previous generation. As a matter of fact, I am trying to exercise on a daily basis so that I do live longer. And not only that, but we have been promised greater benefits than the previous generation. So you have got a lot of baby boomers living longer, getting greater benefits, with fewer people paying into the system. In 1950 I do not know if you know this or not but 16 workers paid for every retiree. Today, there is 3.3 workers paying for every retiree. Soon there will be 2 workers paying for every retiree. So we have got a problem, folks. It is not a problem for people who receive their check. It is a problem for people coming up. It is a problem not for the grandparents but the grandchildren. And so I think now it is time to do something about it, and so does Jim Talent. And I have laid out some proposals. One of them is, why do not we just slow down the growth rate of benefits for some of the wealthier citizens. Their benefits will grow but not as quite as fast as Congress of the past thought they ought to grow. It is called progressive indexing, which, by the way, will get most of the problem solved. I also think younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own payroll tax and set up in a voluntary personal savings account. You know why? Right now the Government gets a whopping 1.8 percent on your money when we hold it in the payroll tax. With a conservative mix of bonds and stocks, you can get at least 4 1/2 percent. You compound that difference over time, somebody is going to have a pretty sizable nest egg they can call their own. The reason I like Jim Talent is because he wants to promote an ownership society in America. He and I reject this business about the investor class only pertains to a certain group of people. We believe everybody in this country ought to own assets. We believe everybody ought to have the ability to pass on their assets to whomever they choose. We know that when you own something, you have a vital stake in the future of the United States of America. Now is the time to not only fix Social Security for generations to come but to make Social Security a better deal for all Americans. And when we get that done, we are going to reform the Tax Code. I put together a group of Democrats and Republicans to make some recommendations. I am looking forward to seeing what those recommendations are. But I will tell you one thing: I know I will have a strong ally in Jim Talent in making sure the Tax Code is more fair, is less large, and accomplishes the mission, and that is to collect revenues for our Government in a fair, honest way. Do you realize that I read a report the other day where some person estimated from the IRS that there is about $325 billion a year in people avoiding taxes. That just is not right. And part of it has to do with the complexities of the Tax Code. For the sake of an economy that grows and for the sake of a better America, we have got to reform the Tax Code of the United States, and we will. I have got a good ally in Jim Talent when it comes to legal reform. One sure way to make sure this country is not competitive is to allow these frivolous and junk lawsuits to continue to plague people who are trying to run businesses. We got too many lawsuits in America, plain and simple. I want to congratulate Matt for getting good legal reform out of the legislature. We ought to do the same thing in Washington. We got a good class-action reform bill out, and I want to thank Jim for his work on that. I think we are going to get an asbestos bill out here pretty quick, which would be good news. Got a good bankruptcy bill out. We need one other bill that is really important. You know, when I went to Washington, I said, Well, most of these legal matters can be solved at the State level, until I began to look at the effect on the Federal budget of these junk and frivolous lawsuits against docs. Because of these lawsuits, doctors either get run out of business, or the premiums go up which cost you or the taxpayers more money or they practice defensive medicine in order to stay out of the courts. It is estimated that these lawsuits cost the Federal Government about $28 billion a year. That is a lot. Even for all the money we spend, that is a lot. And it is not necessary. We want people to have their day in court if they get injured by a lousy doc, but we got to do something about these frivolous lawsuits. I proposed a good piece of legislation that is now stuck in the United States Senate. Jim Talent is a strong backer for medical liability reform at the Federal level, and I want to thank him for his support. I remember when Jim ran for the Senate, he said he would be Missouri's health care Senator, and he has kept that promise. We worked together to strengthen Medicare by giving seniors more choices and by modernizing the system to include a prescription drug benefit. Talent understood what I know what kind of system is it where we pay for surgery from a heart attack but not the medicine to prevent the surgery from being needed in the first place? It was an antiquated, outdated system that needed market incentives in the program and needed to be brought up to date for the sake of our seniors. The Medicare bill that Jim helped pass out of the United States Senate is a good piece of legislation that will mean better quality of life for our seniors in America. And finally, an issue I know is dear to his heart is association health plans. You know, too many small businesses cannot afford health insurance for their employees. And there is a practical way to deal with the problem, and that is to allow small businesses to pool risk across jurisdictional boundaries so they can buy insurance at the same discounts that big companies get to do. It is a sensible approach to helping deal with health care costs. It makes a lot of sense. Talent is the author of that idea on the Senate floor, and I look forward to working with him to get association health care plans past. And I want to thank you for your leadership on that issue. There is a lot of issues that we could be talking about here, and he said, when I got up here, he said, Make sure you keep it relatively short. These people paid a lot of money. I do want to talk about a couple of other things, though. Because of Jim Talent's leadership and steadfast support, our party will continue to support faith-based and community groups as a way to help heal hurt in America. You know, I gave a speech the other day at Calvin College, and I talked about Alexis de Tocqueville. He had interesting observations about America in 1832. He talked about the strength of America being in the souls of our citizens and that people were able to find great comfort and solace and strength through civic organizations, voluntary organizations where people come together to help heal the hurts of society. That was true in 1832, and it is darn sure true today in 2005. The strength of this country lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. And the Federal Government should not fear should not fear the presence of faith to help deal with social problems, as a matter of fact, ought to welcome faith programs and to help deal with social problems. I appreciate Jim's willingness to join me in promoting a culture of life in America. I want to thank Jim for helping defend the institution of marriage from being redefined by activist judges. And speaking about judges I want to thank both Senators from Missouri for understanding that every nominee a President sends up must have a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee, an expeditious hearing in the Judiciary Committee and then an up-or-down vote on the floor of the United States Senate. I nominated a fantastic woman named Priscilla Owen over 4 years ago to the bench, Fifth Court. She is a fantastic lady, tops in her law school class. In our State, you got to run for Supreme Court, and she ran for Supreme Court, got endorsed by Republicans and Democrats, won something like 80 percent of the State because she is a great judge. For 4 long years her nomination was held up for pure partisan reasons 4 years and finally, as a result of never giving up and being steadfast and strong, she got her vote. I want to thank Senators Talent and Bond for supporting this great woman. We got another confirmation that needs to get done too. It is time for the United States Senate to stop playing pure politics, stall politics, and give John Bolton an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. People look at the Government and say, What is going on with all this filibustering? Why cannot people come together and do what is right for the country? Listen, the United Nations needs reform, and I have got a man who can go up there and reform it. And John Bolton needs a vote. People are tired of this. And I appreciate the folks in Missouri sending a strong message to Washington: Focus on the people's business; stop playing politics; get something done for the good of the country. And that is the attitude Jim Talent brings to the Senate floor, and I appreciate that a lot. Jim Talent also understands the war on terror goes on. He is a strong, strong supporter of our military, and I want to thank you for that. You know, we have a duty to make sure these troops get the best possible equipment and the best possible training. And we are fulfilling that obligation. You know, our strategy is clear on the war on terror. We are going to find them overseas so we do not have to find them face them here at home. We will defeat them there in order to protect the homeland. The only way to defend America is to stay on the offense against these people, and that is exactly what the United States of America will continue to do. There are two ways to stay on the offense. One is through good intelligence and good movement of troops and good work with the allies. And there is another way to stay on the offense against the terrorists, and that is to spread freedom. There is nothing that frightens these ideological killers more than democracy. It scares them a lot. They cannot survive in a democracy. They can survive in places where tyrants have discouraged hope, suppressed people. They cannot survive in an open society. See, they cannot stand the light of freedom. And so our strategy is twofold. One, we will be tough as heck and stay on the offense, but we will also have great faith in the capacity of freedom to transform hateful societies to hopeful societies, to transform the conditions that create hate to the conditions that create hope. And that is what you are seeing around the world. It is a fantastic period in American history. If you have got young children, I hope you explain to them what they are seeing. Think about the people in Afghanistan. It was not all that long ago that those poor people lived under the barbaric clutches of the Taliban. These people were so barbaric that young girls were not even allowed to go to school, and if their mothers dared speak out, they were taken to the public square and whipped. We liberated Afghanistan for our own sake. Remember, Afghanistan was the home of Al Qaida and its training camps. I laid out a doctrine that said, If you harbor a terrorist, you are as guilty as the terrorists. And we told the Taliban to get rid of Al Qaida, and they would not do it, and so it is important that when you say something, you mean it. It is important that when you say you are going to do it that you go ahead and do it, for the sake of peace. And we did. But as importantly, 25 million people were liberated in Afghanistan. It is fantastic to think about that. I have had a lot of friends go over to Afghanistan, and Karen Hughes was there early on after the liberation, and she went again. And Laura has been over. And they say that the change is noticeable. Life is coming back, and people are excited. I will tell you a great American story. My barber was raised in Afghanistan. And she came over here to there was a revolution or civil war or whatever you want to call it, and she decided to stay in America, raised her three kids here, and used her great talents and enthusiasm for her country to raise money to build two schools. Think about that. What kind of a country is it where you got a barber to the President working hard, using her influence and her contacts and her friends to raise money quite a bit of money, by the way to build schools in a faraway country, spectacular country that encourages compassion not only at home but abroad. Afghanistan is changing for the better, and as it does, the world will be more peaceful. Listen, we got rid of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Saddam Hussein was a threat to peace. Iraq is changing. I am sure you were amazed, as was much of the world, at the 8 1/2 million people who defied the car bombers and the killers and the suiciders to say as loud as they possibly can, You will not prevent us from voting and exercising our rights as free citizens. What a spectacular moment in history. And now we are standing with the Government as they struggle against these suiciders. But they are getting there. And our mission is clear there as well, and that is to train the Iraqis so they can do the fighting, make sure they can stand up to defend their freedoms, which they want to do. And then our troops are coming home with the honor they earned. And the world will be better off with a free Iraq and a free Afghanistan in the broader Middle East. Ukraine had a freedom revolution. Lebanon is now having a freedom revolution. Listen, freedom is on the march. And the role of the United States of America is to stand with freedom lovers and reformers and believers in the power of democracy. And when we do so and as we do so, we will leave a foundation of peace behind for our children and grandchildren. We are living in a fantastic period in world history. And I want to thank Jim Talent for understanding the great opportunities America has to leave the world a better place for generations coming up. Again, I want to thank you for supporting this good man. He is like we used to say in Texas, when you find a good one, keep him. You got a great Senator in Jim Talent. I thank you for recognizing his talents. I thank you for contributing to his campaign. I thank you for talking up his good work in the coffee shops all around the State of Missouri. You do not have to worry about him; he will be out right behind you, working hard to make sure that in this reelection campaign the citizens of this State do the right thing. It is an honor to be your President. I'd like to stay a little longer, but I am headed to Crawford. I appreciate your warm reception. God bless you, and God bless our great country.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdinnerforsenatorjamesmtalentstlouismissouri", "title": "Remarks at a Dinner for Senator James M.

{"id": 682, "text": "Hello, everybody. I am really proud that all of you came to the picnic that Rosalynn and I and Amy have put on with you, along with 3M Company. We are glad to be your cohosts and also the guests of a very fine example of the free enterprise system of our country. 3M was the first company in our Nation that was given the national award for conserving energy. And I think what they have done is typical of what has been done throughout the State of Wisconsin. When your former Governor, Pat Lucey, who is now a very distinguished and able Ambassador to Mexico, was in office, he initiated some conservation measures in Wisconsin which have been good as an example for the entire Nation. You as a people in Wisconsin use 20 percent less energy per person than the average throughout our country, in spite of the fact that you rank 12th in industrial production and in spite of the fact that on normal days you have cooler weather than we do in Georgia-but I think today you have equaled the Georgia climate and temperature. But you have not done well enough. And neither has anyone in the United States done well enough in saving energy. Our country has a great challenge before us at this time. There is no conflict between the two things that we must do. One is to conserve energy, to stop waste, and secondly, to produce more energy in our own Nation. Our Nation's security is threatened because we are too dependent on foreign oil. So, everyone in the United States must do as we have done in the past when our country was in danger or when it was threatened-unite with one another, instead of being divided one from another, and realize that every single American is important, cut back on waste of energy in your driving habits, obey the speed limits, join in the vanpool system that 3M is doing in other parts of the country-will soon be doing here-make sure that you do not waste energy in your home, do everything you can to save precious energy. And secondly, we will have to use more solar power. We will have to use more coal from within our own country, and we will produce more oil and gas and synthetic fuels. If we do those things, there is no doubt in my mind that we can meet this present challenge. Our country, as you well know, is the greatest nation on Earth. We are the strongest nation politically; we are the strongest nation economically; we are certainly the strongest nation militarily. And we have got something else as well. God has blessed us above all other peoples with natural resources, not only a great river, one of the best avenues for traffic and also freight and also passengers in the whole world-one of the most enjoyable trips, I think, imaginable anywhere-but, of course, we have also been blessed with energy reserves. In our Nation we have got 25 percent of all the energy reserves in the whole world. All the OPEC nations in the Mideast put together only have 5 percent. So, God's blessed us with a strong nation and with a nation that has enough natural resources. It is up to us. And I have come here this afternoon to remind you that sometimes we do get too discouraged. We ought to inventory what we have got. We ought to count our blessings and figure out how you as citizens of our country, how I as the highest elected official in the greatest nation on Earth, State officials, local officials, the Congress can all work together, not separated one from another, not criticizing one another, not looking for scapegoats, but how we can make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future. That is what I have pledged to do. If you will help me, we will do it together. Thank you very much. God bless all of you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspicnicsponsoredtheminnesotaminingandmanufacturingcompanyprairieduchien", "title": "Remarks at a Picnic Sponsored by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-picnic-sponsored-the-minnesota-mining-and-manufacturing-company-prairie-du-chien", "publication_date": "19-08-1979", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 980, "text": "Well, it is good once again to be with my friend, Prime Minister Abe, and the Japanese delegation. We have been able to forge, I think, an excellent relationship on a whole host of issues and this gives us an opportunity to continue to discuss both our security cooperation and our economic cooperation. The United States-Japanese alliance is one of the linchpins of our security as well as Japan's, and this gives us an opportunity to continue to deepen that relationship, building off the discussions we have had in Washington. It includes the realignment in Okinawa. I want to congratulate Prime Minister Abe on his recent legislation related to bolstering Japanese defense capabilities, and it will give us a chance to talk about a wide range of threats, both regionally and internationally. I also want to express my appreciation for the hard work that Shinzo has been involved with in building up stronger regional understandings. The trilateral meetings that have been taking place between Japan, China, and South Korea I think are especially important. And Shinzo and I both share an interest in continuing to foster rule of law, supporting international norms in areas like navigation-freedom of navigation and maritime law. And again, this bilateral gives us an opportunity to examine how we can work with some of the regional organizations like ASEAN in order to continue to maintain the stability and-that has been the hallmark of this region and has allowed for extraordinary prosperity and growth. And finally, we will be discussing a wide range of economic issues coming out of our meeting at the G-20. Both of us are interested in ratifying and implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has been a major topic of conversation here at APEC and the G-20. There is a recognition that these kinds of high-standard rules that provide enforceable protections for labor and the environment are the wave of the future and could not have been done without Shinzo's leadership. We will also be talking about the climate change conference in Paris, and the importance of all of us working together in order to achieve a strong agreement that can protect the planet for future generations. So I want to say that on every issue that is of great importance to the United States of America, we have got a great partner in Japan and we very much appreciate it.

{"id": 765, "text": "What a moment of hope it was 1 year ago when Central American leaders concluded their meeting in Guatemala. The Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, a Communist regime fighting a civil war against 15,000 Nicaraguan freedom fighters opposed to their oppression, agreed to a series of sweeping democratic reforms. If carried out, those reforms would have ended the killing and brought peace to Nicaragua and Central America. It would also have meant that Nicaragua would at last join the family of free, democratic nations. At first, there were a few hopeful signs. To much media fanfare, the opposition newspaper in Nicaragua, La Prensa, was reopened. Independent radio stations were allowed to broadcast again. A few political prisoners were released, and political groups were allowed more latitude. Most important, Sandinistas finally agreed to the freedom fighters' request for direct negotiations for a peaceful, democratic settlement. Now the main reason the Sandinistas agreed to those steps a year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters, including important battlefield victories like the one at Los Minas. But tragically, at the very moment when continued strength and determination by the United States might have meant the continued success of the peace plan, the United States House of Representatives decided, and by only a very narrow margin, to refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters. This, of course, removed the principal prod-the military victories and popular success of the freedom fighters-to Sandinista participation in the peace plan and sent an immediate signal of American weakness to the Communists. This failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and sad consequences-just how costly and sad we have seen during the past few weeks. Communist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega has been visiting Castro in Cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who has brought so much sadness and misery to that country; while in Nicaragua, a renewed attack on political dissent is being led by the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated Communist and grim, hardened repressor of human rights whose office, according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also been actively engaged in the international drug trade. Acting under the orders of the Communist leaders and Borge's supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans. Opposition leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison. Political, religious liberties have again been curtailed. The Communists ordered the Catholic archbishop to shut down the Catholic radio station, and for almost 2 weeks the independent newspaper, La Prensa, was refused permission to publish. And the American ambassador was expelled. And yet, while the cutoff of aid to the freedom fighters was a dreadful mistake, getting the cause of peace and freedom back on track-not recrimination-must now be our goal. There is a chance for real bipartisan consensus in support of renewed contra aid. Indeed, one of its strong supporters has recently been named to be the Vice Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party. Senator Bob Dole intends soon to offer legislation to renew effective assistance to the freedom fighters. The final details are being worked out. And I urge the Members of the Senate to support the aid package, and I also ask the House of Representatives to move speedily and favorably on the Senate legislation. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue aggressively our diplomatic efforts with the Central American democracies. So much is at stake. A few years ago, there were those who said the cause of freedom and democracy was lost in El Salvador. Well, perhaps some of you remember that incredible scene when the people of that country defied Communist threats and bullets to march to the polls and vote for democracy. The American aid package that helped make democracy victorious in El Salvador passed by only two votes in the House-but pass it did, and democracy did come. A few weeks ago, both Vice President Bush and I visited the bedside of one of the heroes of that struggle, President Duarte of El Salvador. President Duarte has had no easy life. He has been continually threatened by extremists of both left and right. His daughter was kidnapped by Communist guerrillas. And now, while in a desperate struggle with cancer, he continues to lead his nation on the high road to democracy. I cannot tell you how deeply moved Vice President Bush and I were by our visit to this brave and remarkable man and how determined we both were that his dream for his people and all the peoples of Central America should be made a reality-the dream of peace and freedom for every man, woman, and child. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationaidthenicaraguandemocraticresistance", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on Aid to the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-aid-the-nicaraguan-democratic-resistance", "publication_date": "30-07-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 896, "text": "I WANTED to take this opportunity, as we arrive here, to say just a few words of greeting to all of you because it will not be possible for me to do what both Mrs. Nixon and I would particularly like to do, and that is to greet every one of you personally. In coming before you, I first want you to know that because this platform is so small, we could only get the men on the platform. Women's Lib, please do not give us any trouble. I am very proud to be here in Montana, and I will introduce these people. You know them all so well, but I think you all want to welcome your people from Montana, as they are here. Mike Mansfield, the Majority Leader of the Senate. Of course, the Governor of the State of Montana. Governor. And the Congressman from this district, Dick Shoup. The Congressman from the other district in Montana, Congressman Melcher. Now, all of you will have noted that this is a totally bipartisan group. And that is the spirit in which this visit has been arranged. I want to say first that I have many pleasant memories of visits to this State. I have been to a number of cities. I recall visits to Butte and Billings and to Great Falls and to Bozeman and also, of course, to the State capital, to Helena. I am very proud that this is the first time I have had a chance to visit Montana as ENTITY of the United States. I am also equally proud that Mike Mansfield arranged that this is the first time I have had any chance ever to come to Kalispell in this area. I am glad to be here in this beautiful part of the country. Now, as you have probably noted, the Majority Leader of the Senate and ENTITY of the United States have regular meetings, usually at breakfast, in addition to the meetings that we have in the Cabinet Room, concerning legislation. I am sure that many of you wonder what those meetings concern. Well, obviously they concern the affairs of state. They naturally involve matters on which we sometimes disagree, disagree not as partisans, but disagree because there are areas where different people, working toward the same goal, might want to take different roads. But I think you will all be glad to know that there is one subject on which we have no disagreement whatever. That is on the beauty of the Big Sky Country. I want to say something about your representatives, both the Republican as well as the two Democrats, in the Congress of the United States from Montana. Many people ,who come to Washington-they get Potomac fever, and that means they really get so taken with Washington they. forget the folks back home. I have never yet met a Senator or a Congressman from Montana who did not love Montana most of all, and that is true of yours, I can assure you. I think I can tell you why. There is a story--I do not know whether it is true or not; I could not believe it when I saw it in my notes, and I was not able to check it with Mike or Dick or Congressman Melcher on the way put--there is a story about a big wind that came up in Helena, the State capital, so big, as a matter of fact, that it turned the Goddess of Liberty statue around so that it was facing away from the city. There were those, not from Montana, of course, and not from Helena, who said that what really was happening was that the Goddess of Liberty was turning her back on the city. I do not think that was the case. I think what the Goddess of Liberty was really doing was turning out so that she could really see this beautiful country. This is a beautiful country, and you can be very proud to live in it. And as I speak of this country, I think it is particularly appropriate that it is the Big Sky Country. It is an open country. There is still lots of ground out here, lots of beautiful territory for people to see, for people to visit, for people to live in. That brings me to a point on which here is total agreement among all of us on this platform, although we might have different ways to achieve that goal. We want an open country, we want open cities, and we also want an open world. At the present time we are ending the longest war in the history of the United States. We are also trying to build--and we are having success in building--a new structure of peace, one which will provide not just peace for a year, for the next election, or for the next 5 years, but provide for something we have not had for this whole century: a whole generation of peace. I think that is what Americans want most of all. When I noticed the high school students were here, the various bands that have been playing, when I see so many young people, and when I see your parents, I know that is what you want. As you know, from here we are going on to Portland and then up to Alaska to welcome the Emperor of Japan. Later, I will have the opportunity to visit Mainland China, the People's Republic of China. Let me just tell you what these visits have to do with this generation of peace. Very simply this: They are not going to solve all differences between nations, particularly with regard to those great differences that exist between the Government of the United States and the Government of the People's Republic of China, with which we do not have diplomatic relations at this time. But they do mean this: They do mean that a step has been taken toward a goal. When nations have differences, they can either talk about them and negotiate about them or they can fight about them. If 10 to 15 years from now the People's Republic of China is still isolated from the rest of the world, and particularly with no communication with the United States of America, there is a great danger that due to that isolation we might end in finding that our differences were ones that we could not talk about, and we might end up fighting about. I believe we have got to avoid that. I believe the time to start avoiding that is now, to make this an open world in which we negotiate rather than confront those who differ with us around the world. In that goal, let me say we have bipartisan support. I think we have the support of all generations. There is one other thing I would like to say before we have a chance to meet some of you. As we build this generation of peace, we also want a new prosperity that is based not on war, but on peace, in which production for peace provides the jobs that Americans need. This is something we all want. It is something that we can build. It is something that this State can contribute to and that all of you can contribute to. Finally, let me say that in this Nation in these years ahead we want this Nation to continue to have not only those areas that can produce, as the great agricultural area of Montana produces, for making this the best fed, the best dressed nation in the world but also the beauty of this country, which this State has in such remarkable degrees. One final story to illustrate it: A couple of months ago, among the many visitors that stream through the Oval Office of the White House, was a tremendously interesting group of teenagers from the State of Washington. They had ridden bicycles clear across the country. They called themselves Cyclemates. As they rode across the country they stopped at various places. It, of course took them weeks to arrive in Washington. I asked them this question: I said, Now, you tell me you have been to the parks, you have been to all the States, what was the most beautiful place you saw? And they said, Glacier Park, of all the the places in the United States. Not only did they like that place but they also liked the people. So, I say, as we meet you here, and with this little California rain falling right now, that I am glad to be here. Mrs. Nixon is glad to be here to receive such a warm welcome. We hope that this will always be the Big Sky Country and that people who come across it will always say, This is a beautiful place to visit. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksarrivalkalispellmontana", "title": "Remarks on Arrival at Kalispell, Montana.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-arrival-kalispell-montana", "publication_date": "25-09-1971", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}
