{"id": 205, "text": "Thank you, Governor Baliles. Thank all of you Bill. Before I make my remarks, I want to comment on a very disturbing report that we have just heard. There are unconfirmed reports that Colonel Higgins has, indeed, been executed. And I had planned to go on out to Nevada for another appearance today and then to go to Oklahoma tonight. But this matter is of such concern to me and to all of you and to the American people that I think it is appropriate that I go back to Washington. Whether the report is true or not, I know I speak for all here when I try to express to the American people the sense of outrage that we all feel about this kind of brutality, this uncalled-for terrorism. And this was a young American colonel serving in an international force, and it is incumbent on all of us to try to rectify this situation, if at all possible. And I have no more to share with you on this. We have not been able to confirm this horrible report, but I will go back to Washington and convene our top national security people and, first, establish to the best of our ability if the report is true and then figure out what might conceivably be done. So, I am sorry to bring to this meeting a message of that nature, the bad news, but I felt you would want to know about it. Jerry, that said, thank you very much. I want to commend you on your success as chairman of this group. I studied Latin for 4 years. Soon you will be chairman emeritus. E in Latin means out meritus damn well deserves to be. So, I will but I want to commend you that having been said commend you on that. It is been a joy working with you. And I want to salute our host and my friend, Jim Thompson a great Governor, former NGA chairman, who is rocked the world of Illinois politics by announcing that he will not run for a fifth term. They were just getting used to him out here, and now he is not going to run. But thank you for your hospitality. I'd like to rise to John Sununu's defense: He is not quiet and retiring. That is all I will say about it. But I think it is good to have a Chief of Staff who knows how the Governors function and the importance of the Governors in this whole Federalist system. I think Jerry mentioned Ed Derwinski, a member of my Cabinet, a good friend of longstanding. And I want to salute him and also our Secretary of Transportation, Illinois' own Sam Skinner, who is with me here today. Both doing outstanding jobs Sam digging in now, working on a national transportation strategy. And Terry Branstad, the incoming president let me say I look forward to working with you, and I hope we will have an era of real cooperation, just as we have with Governor Baliles. Let us begin by saying what is the role of the Governor in the American political life? Well, de Tocqueville, the great 19th century observer, once asked a country politician the same question, and the answer he got was this: The Governor counts for absolutely nothing and is paid only $1,200. Well, you still cannot get rich off a public salary. But today I do not think there is any question in the minds of the American people that the office of Governor counts for an awful lot counts for a great deal. In fact, leadership in America is increasingly the sum of your efforts and of your vision. And that is why I consider myself a Federalist. I was there when President Reagan issued the Executive order on federalism, and I want you to know that I stand by it. We believe in federalism, and yet we are a people, one nation, indivisible. And just as we share our cherished Constitution, so we also share common challenges and responsibilities. To cure our nation of illiteracy and drug abuse and crime, we must act in tandem President with Governor, Governor with mayor, up and down the line and in short, we have got to find our collective will as a nation. And that is why I have come to Chicago to meet with all of you fellow chief executives. We share as executives a special responsibility, and some describe it as a great burden. But for us, if it is a burden, it is one that is cheerfully accepted. And to sit where the buck stops, to resolve disputes, to help those in need and to set a course for the future, is to know a special kind of satisfaction. In fact, our missions as executives are so similar that many Presidents have called on you for guidance. Teddy Roosevelt, who called the Nation's first conference of Governors, the forerunner of this association, convened the Governors at the White House. And he brought the Nation's Governors together to call for conservation, for an end to the reckless denuding of our forests. And they started a tradition that we are carrying on today: working together as President and Governors for a cleaner environment. I thought you might be interested in a peripheral note here. I am just back from the economic summit in Europe, and the whole question of environment is on the minds of these Western European leaders, unlike any time that I have ever seen. And I think that is a good thing. And I think it is going to cause all of us to work together internationally just as my plea is here that we work together inside our great country. We have proposed, as you know, the first major revision of the Clean Air Act in more than a decade. And I read a headline in one of the great newspapers of this country where some say it did not go far enough and others said it went too far. I figured, well, maybe we are not doing too bad on it. But it sets tough standards; it gives States and industry the flexibility needed to reduce costs and break the longstanding legislative logjam. The potential for consensus is there. The American people want clean air, and we can work together to see that they get clean air. Then it was another Roosevelt great President, Franklin D. Roosevelt who called on the Governors to help him stem the financial crisis of the Great Depression. And today we do not meet in a spirit of immediate crisis; plenty of problems out there, but the Nation is fundamentally sound. But the decline of our educational system and the threat of crime and drugs, the economic dependency of so many, and yes, that ever-present Federal deficit and the problems that come with it these problems threaten to endanger the very leadership position of America in the next century. And for America to remain competitive will require your best efforts and your executive know-how. The ultimate challenge, as Governor Baliles put it, is to become again the Yankee traders that we once were. And he is not talking about George Steinbrenner New York Yankees owner. He is referring to the clipper ships. Your creative response to our nation's competitive position is more than perceptive; it is forward looking, an attribute to the best kind of leadership. At this economic summit that I mentioned, the competitive position of our nation was an underlying theme in the discussions of the great economic issues of trade and monetary policy and international debt. But no less important to America was the start of my journey, that part that took us to Eastern Europe and central Europe. Poland and Hungary today are not the economic magnets that we find in Western Europe or the Pacific rim, but I saw a tremendous potential in the awakening spirit of those lands. It is absolutely amazing the changes that are taking place on the economic front there and on the political front as well. And the beauty of it is that we can boost reform without massive government-to-government programs. We can do the most good as American leaders by simply facilitating trade and investment, by simply opening doors for opportunity and encouraging those governments to move as fast as they can towards privatization. But to open these doors will require leadership at every level of government. You have already established a great tradition of searching for those opportunities abroad, and now I ask you to include Poland and Hungary on your list. While Governors have no formal role in foreign policy, you are becoming our economic envoys and ambassadors of democracy. You are a new force in restoring American international competitiveness and expanding world markets for American goods and services. And of course, your focus is and, I think, must be on the critical domestic issues. As chief executives, we know firsthand how crucial our social health is to the future position of America. A nation in which half of our youth is ignorant of geography, in which drugs are rampant, in which a substantial proportion of the population knows little hope such a nation will not long remain competitive. And in the final analysis, improving our schools, driving out drugs, and bringing hope and opportunity to those who need it most these are issues of our national well-being, even our national security. First and foremost are our children and their education. Working together, we can raise the level of learning in the classrooms of America. On April 5th, I sent a package to the Congress, an educational reform package based on four principles rooted in the practical experience of the States. To have reform, excellence and achievement must be recognized and rewarded; to have reform, Federal dollars should be targeted to those most in need; to have reform, we need flexibility and choice choice for parents, choice for schools in their selection of teachers and principals. And finally, the essence of reform is accountability in education and reward for those schools that show progress. If implemented, I believe that these measures will restore the quality of American education and redeem the future of millions of children, but there is more to be done. On June 5th, I asked the business community to study what the private sector can do to energize and support educational reform. And there are wonderful programs in effect now where business leaders assign people from their companies to help in the local school districts. These have been pushed and fostered by many of you around this table. I want to renew my pledge to assemble the Governors in a summit to share ideas and to explore options for educational progress. Only twice before have the Governors met with the President on an issue of vital national importance. And now there will be a third such conference, an historic meeting on education. And so, I invite you to work with me at a Governors' summit on education to be held on September 27th and September 28th. We have not yet selected a place, but we want to go forward and do that. And together, we can find ways to strengthen our schools, to enlarge opportunities, and to improve our nation's educational performance. As chief executives, we also see drugs and crime as the most harrowing domestic threat to the future of America. And I proposed on May 15th a commonsense approach to deter the criminals' use of weapons, to reform the criminal justice system, to enhance enforcement and prosecution, and to expand prison capacity to ensure both the certainty and the severity of punishment. I proposed the hiring of 825 new Federal agents and staff, 1,600 new prosecutors and staff, and an additional $1 billion for Federal prison construction. And I have proposed tough new laws, including mandatory prison terms, no deals without cooperation, and the death penalty for those who murder our police officers. But I need your leadership to see results. Work with me. Toughen your laws and put the worst offenders behind bars. And if you do, we will take back the streets. And finally, America cannot continue to lead the world if we lag in providing opportunity at home. And last year, as you know, Congress and the administration enacted major welfare reform legislation the Family Support Act of 1988. And this act grew out of a consensus that the well-being of children depends on more than material needs. Children need a family environment that encourages self-sufficiency in a word, character. With this in mind, I reestablished the Low Income Opportunity Board within the White House. And I have asked that board to assist you in the complex and time-consuming process of obtaining these Federal approvals for experiments in State welfare reform. So many innovative policies have come from the States. So, we want to work together to keep your administrations free to experiment, free to be creative. In fact, I have asked our Domestic Policy Council and the Low Income Opportunity Board to make flexibility the guiding principle, so that States will have greater freedom to experiment with welfare reform. And I am pleased to announce that this week the DPC, Domestic Policy Council, has committed itself to give you greater room to maneuver and to grant waiver requests as quickly as possible. Many of our responsibilities overlap in education, law enforcement, and welfare. At times, there is been friction, a lot of friction between the States and the Feds. And perhaps what we need between the Federal Government and the States is a friendly competition well-known to Chicagoans. Here, along the majestic lakefront skyline, there is been an ongoing competition among developers to retain the title of the world's tallest building. You talk about one-upsmanship, this is it a whole new meaning. Yet this is the kind of one-upsmanship that builds, not destroys; that lifts, not lowers; that takes us all a little closer, a little closer to the stars. I have committed the powers of my office to lift America, starting in the classrooms and the streets. Working together, I am absolutely convinced that we can achieve a national consensus in spite of the overriding budgetary problems that the Federal Government faces. Working together, we can make the next century an American century. Thank you. Thank you all for what you do for this country, and I am just delighted to have been with you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ENTITY. The President has agreed to take a couple of questions. I will call on our vice chairman, Governor Branstad of Iowa, for the first question. ENTITY, we are very honored that you have invited us in the third only Presidential summit with the Governors on the topic. And I am delighted that you have chosen education because that is going to be an area of focus of the Governors for this coming year. And I just want to add my appreciation and say that we look forward to working with you and developing consensus goals to improve the quality of education, and we want to involve all the people in this nation that are concerned about rebuilding and strengthening the quality of education. Thank you for that commitment. Thank you for your question. No, but thank you, Terry, and we look forward to working with you. ENTITY, first of all, we appreciate your speech and your commitment both to fighting drugs and to improving education. I support, as I think you know, your education position. I am for accountability, choice, alternative certification. One thing that concerns me in our State, and I think is a concern around the table here that I'd like to hear you comment on, is the relative lack of competitiveness of our high school seniors with many of the other countries with which you have been negotiating new economic, environmental, and defense arrangements. What do you think the Federal role ought to be in trying to increase the number of people who can afford to go on to college or who cannot afford to go on to college but need to so that they can be internationally competitive? And do you believe that that ought to be a part of our education summit in September? I am very concerned about that, and that is something that neither the States nor the Federal Government has adequately addressed, in my judgment, in these 3 or 4 years. I think, clearly, the Federal Government has a role. We have some programs. I know everybody would like to see them financed more fully, thinking of Pell grants and things of this nature. And I have been intrigued with some of the private sector approaches. A fellow named Pat Taylor in New Orleans has a program that I believe I do not know whether Governor Roemer I did not where is he can comment on. I do not know whether he likes it or not. But nevertheless, it is a program that has some applicability to what we are talking about here. It is happened in other States. But, yes, I think it should be a key agenda item for the summit that we are talking about. Again, every time we get to worthy goals, I have to say: Wait, how do we meet Gramm-Rudman's targets and all of that? But clearly, in terms of objective, it must be that. But, Bill, I'd also say that what you have talked about and you have pioneered, along with others around this table I can single out Governors Baliles and Kean because they will both be unemployed here in a few weeks. But this concept of encouraging excellence the way your States have done it I think has great applicability for how a high school senior goes forward and gets into college. So, anyway but it should be an agenda item. Governor Celeste of Ohio. Where is Dick? I did not recognize you. Yes? ENTITY, you just alluded to the notion of worthy goals and budget realities. And this morning the Governors around the breakfast table talked at length about the problems we are facing now with Medicaid and the mandated costs that are built in as a consequence of decisions that have been made in the Congress. And I think it is our feeling that we would like to, number one, share with our congressional delegations the realities we are now contending with as Governors but to call on them and perhaps to seek the assistance of the administration, as well, to have a 2-year moratorium on any additional mandates in terms of Medicaid with a commitment that all of us sit down together on a bipartisan basis Governors, the Congress, the administration to look at this whole issue of health care: how we assure coverage to those who need it; how we deal with this problem of sort of backing into a system which is virtually universal now for various pregnant women and small children, and to do it in a cost-efficient way. And I am wondering whether you would be comfortable with a notion, for example, of a moratorium on additional mandates at this point and whether there is a way in which we could work together on this important issue? Well, I'd like to consider it. And certainly you are trying to hold the line on the spiraling costs. We are in a battle now and I think we can resolve it properly with some of our doctors in terms of the increased costs of physicians' fees. But, yes, without getting into the specifics, I'd certainly think we could cooperate fully. Maybe we could take one more, okay? ENTITY, under our chairman's direction this spring and summer, I conducted a series of hearings around the Nation on our nation's transportation infrastructure. Two key facts came out of those hearings. One, those nations which make an increased investment in their highways, their bridges, their harbors, their air and rail systems, their water systems are more competitive in the world economy than those nations who do less. And secondly, those nations who make such investments stimulate more private investment than those nations who do less. I do not have a question; I have a suggestion, if I might be so bold. Could you ask Director Darman, Secretary Brady, Secretary Skinner, and Secretary Mosbacher to form kind of a working group to make sure that our tax laws and our transportation policies are doing everything we can to encourage a renewal of America's transportation infrastructure? I know it will be part of Secretary Skinner's national strategies plan, but I think there needs to be more focus in Washington on the benefits of infrastructure investment and a return to our economy, especially our competitive world economy. And I think those four good men could really help in that effort. Well, let us try, and I appreciate the suggestion. And for those out around here from Illinois, I must say I am very pleased to be working with Sam Skinner in this field. I know the frustrations around this table when you see this tremendous highway trust fund and wonder why those funds are not immediately available for the purposes for which they were earmarked. And the answer, obviously, is budgetary. But, yes, I'd be very happy to ask the four of them to get together. Nice to see you again, ENTITY. I just wanted to follow up on the point that you had made and offer, for whatever it is worth, my congratulations on the September 27th summit, vis-a-vis education. I would like to say that the Southern Growth Policies Board, which Carroll Campbell has headed for this past year and which I will head for this next year, is concerned. As the world grows smaller, cheap is not enough; we must be flexible and smarter. And we have undertaken, ENTITY, the goal to address adult illiteracy in our part of America. And I would encourage your team at the educational summit to address that question in context of the whole nation. It seems to me that we are going to be making more products one product, one person, one sale, rather than mass production. And it seems that the quality of our work force will be the key to us being competitive not just the price of the work force, but the quality of the work force. That is one of our assignments in the South, and we are hoping you can help us nationwide. What I am trying to say, ENTITY, is send money. Thank you. I thought I heard that. I said it poorly, as usual, but . Let me say that, on this educational summit, I do not view this is as something where like today where I come here for 2 minutes and then take off. I mean, this is going to be a session where we will have an opportunity together, you and me, to take a considerable amount of time to discuss these kinds of issues. I think it is important, and maybe Governor Branstad would be the one to turn to to have a little group for the agenda on this. And our Education Secretary will be involved; but sure, we should take that up. And I want you to know I will be personally involved in learning from this kind of involvement. But thank you all very, very much.

{"id": 434, "text": "Good evening. We have checked all of our history books, and as best we can figure out, this is the first time ever a sitting ENTITY and ENTITY have ever been on a program, radio or television, together while in office. We will be entertaining your calls later. Also, later in the program we will be giving you a number for Save the Children. I am wearing a Save the Children tie in conjunction with our 10th anniversary. We will be associating Save the Children programs throughout the month, and we will tell you later where you can order beautiful ties like this. ENTITY and ENTITY have them as well, but are not wearing them tonight. But they both have or are in possession of these ties. We will talk about lots of things, but the most obvious to me-if something, God forbid, happened to you, how long would it take to brief you? Oh, that is not a hypothetical that I am comfortable with, but there are procedures that are in place that we have discussed because it is our duty to the country and the Constitution. Are you and-is he-- I know what you are asking. The answer is, no time at all. I think it is clear that the is more closely involved with all the decisions of this administration than any of his predecessors. In the-- So you could take over-- Absolutely. I think that we were very fortunate when Harry Truman became President-he'd just been in office a little while, and at that time Vice Presidents were not as involved as they now are. But he turned out to be a great President. But we were lucky, because he was not in the loop on a lot of things. And then, of course, when President Johnson had to become President, he had been Senate majority leader and there was a little more of a-he had a more active role. But Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Bush, I think, all tended to give the ENTITY a much larger role. And then, because of the relationship we have and because of my conviction about what the Constitution really requires me to do and because it is good for the American people, ENTITY Gore is the most involved ENTITY in the history of the country. So you never feel, ENTITY, out of the loop? No, never. And it is been a great privilege, really. Do you talk every day? Every day, many, many times. You are not-if you are in different parts of the world, you talk every day? Just about. There are times when we do not , if he is on another continent than I am, but even then sometimes we do. And are you two definitely running again as a ticket? I do not think we have officially-- He is not ready to make any announcements. Oh, come on, make it. Everybody makes it here; make it. I have not asked him yet, but if he is willing, that would be my intention. Okay, your intention is to run again and ask him to serve again. Absolutely. And would you serve again if asked? Well, I enjoy this job a great deal, and I count it a privilege to have this learning experience and to be able to work for and with ENTITY. You should not have any doubt about that. But we are waiting on any formal announcements. I just wanted to know. Anything you can tell us about the pilot? No, except that we are working on it very hard. Is he signaling? Is there a report of signals out of Bosnia? Well, you know what the news reports are, but I can tell you that I have been keeping on top of this ever since the first report of the missing plane. And we are doing everything we can, but it is best that we say as little as possible. Is this, ENTITY, as some diplomat called it today, a great failure of Western diplomacy, all Western diplomacy? Well, clearly, this is a tragedy that has been unfolding for a long time, some would say for 500 years. But certainly, it was a full-blown tragedy before we ever got here. But I think that it is important to realize that NATO, the most successful alliance in history, never really did that great a job when it was outside of the NATO area, dealing with a conflict between two countries neither of whom was a part of NATO. And that is the situation here. They have done a great deal. And I think a lot of people have not paid much attention to the change that has come about since President Clinton's policy was put into place. Some of the numbers are not very well known, but the change has been pretty significant. Let me just say this. First of all, I disagree with that. You disagree with the ENTITY? No, I agree with him, and I disagree with those who say-- Oh-it is failed. --that the whole thing has been a great failure. It has not been a success. But remember, how long has this war been going on? Since 1991, in essence. That is 4 years. It is tragic; it is terrible. But their enmities go back 500 years, some would say almost a thousand years. Now, what are our interests and what are our objectives there? First of all, we do not want the war to spread beyond Bosnia. Secondly, we want to alleviate the human suffering and reduce the killing. And thirdly, we want to support a diplomatic process for peace. Now, let me just follow up on what the ENTITY said. The war has not spread. We have worked hard on that. We have worked with our NATO allies and with the U.N. in the longest humanitarian airlift in history and to keep the skies free of bombers to take the war out of the air, which is what our brave pilot was doing when he was shot down. We have worked with the U.N. peacekeepers on the ground to try to establish safe havens through the use, again, of only of our air power; we have no ground forces there. In 1992, the year we had our interview in Orlando, about 130,000 people were killed in Bosnia. Last year, 1994, less than 3,000 people were killed there. That is still tragic, but I hardly think that constitutes a colossal failure, especially-now, let me just say one other thing. Look at-you are going to go to the Middle East on Thursday with your interviews-- We are going to talk to all of them. We look at the progress in the Middle East. We look at progress in Northern Ireland. We look at the joy we have in the elections in South Africa. All those conflicts went on for a lot more than 4 years. And I am proud of the role the United States is playing in the peace process in all those places, but it became possible when people decided they wanted to make peace and they wanted to stop killing each other there. That is the point I want to make. So, I am not happy with everything that is happened in Bosnia. I wish there were some clearcut answer. I do not think we should have ground troops there in combat or in the peacekeeping force. At all? No. I have said where I think- if they make a peace, they stop fighting, they want us to help police it like we have in the Middle East since the late seventies, that is something that we would consider doing, after consultation with Congress. If our people-if the U.N. has to pull out, they are our NATO allies and they need us, I'd be inclined to help them. If they get stranded and they are in desperate conditions, I'd be inclined to help them. I think that is something we should look at. But we should not be involved on the ground there. We have achieved these other objectives. And if you go from 130,000 dead down to under 3,000 dead and you have still got a talk going, you have got a chance of a diplomatic solution, what is the difference in that and Northern Ireland, the Middle East, and these other places? It takes time. If it spreads, do we have to go? Like to Macedonia, would we have to go? We have to do-we have troops in Macedonia because we are determined not to have a Balkan war. That, after all, is how World War I got started. We do not want this thing to spread across the Balkans, and I think all Americans would understand that. Do we have a moral obligation, Mr. ENTITY, to these people? Moral, if not strategic? I think the world clearly has an interest in doing what is reasonable and necessary to stop an ethnically based conquering by one country of another. And our NATO allies have shown tremendous courage and fortitude in putting their troops there on the ground. We have chosen not to do that. They are closer to it. It is on the Continent of Europe. We have provided some support to them, but our allies are the ones that are there on the ground. And I think that that is the correct choice for them to make. But Larry, first of all, we have spent a great deal of money there, running this humanitarian airlift, giving air support, trying to create free-fire zones, if you will, around Sarajevo and the other populated eastern enclaves, in doing all the things we have done to support the no-fly zone and to support the British, the French, the Dutch, the Canadians, and others there on the ground. All of us have done this at a significant investment. And they are at some risk, as you see when several hundred of them got captured. If you reduce the casualties from 130,000 to under 3,000 and you at least have the possibility of cease-fires and ongoing negotiations and you continue humanitarian aid, it seems to me that that is fulfilling a moral obligation. Do we have the capacity to impose a settlement on people who want to continue fighting? We could not do that in Northern Ireland. We could not do that in the Middle East. And I would submit, if you look at the population and the geography and the history of Bosnia, we cannot do that there. So I believe we are doing the right thing. There is a lot of bases to cover. One more-are you now optimistic on Bosnia? Are you sounding like things are going to turn better? What I think is that we have to continue to pursue a strategy of diplomacy and keeping people alive and minimizing the brutality and trying to make the peacekeeping mission work. If it fails, then we will have to consider what our options are then. But no troops. Anyone who is worried about the U.S. sending ground troops there should not be. That is not going to happen. We have the Middle East program coming Thursday night with Hussein and Rabin and Arafat. You have been talking to people involved. How is it going? We have got a chance for Syria to get involved with the peace treaty. I think we have got a chance to make it this year. And I think that Mr. Arafat is trying to implement his part of the accords. I think he is making progress. Prime Minister Rabin has shown great courage. King Hussein has always wanted these days to come about, and he is working hard to work through the things that have to be done. President Mubarak in Egypt has been a great support. And I think President Asad wants peace. We are -- You do? Yes, I do. I am convinced he does. Now, there are a lot of difficult stones in the road, and we may not make it, but I think we have got a chance. Well, let me just recall for you, Larry, that a lot has happened since this President came into office. The state of war between Israel and Jordan, after 46 years, was ended, right out here on the South Lawn of the White House, with ENTITY presiding over it. The long period of estrangement and no even-not even any talking between the PLO and Israel was ended with the famous handshake, again presided over by ENTITY. He went to the signing of the agreement in the Middle East. The dialog with Syria has now reached the point where people who follow this very, very closely, as we do, believe that there is the kind of movement that can really inspire a great deal of hope. This is a fundamental change. Now you have, on a regular basis, Arafat sitting down with Israeli leaders and beginning to work through all of the problems there. And all of the leaders there give ENTITY the credit for the progress. I would say this: In light of what we have been through in Oklahoma City and with the World Trade Center, if we could succeed in bringing a comprehensive peace to the Middle East and then we could bring the benefits of that peace to all the people who live there, I believe that that would help us to defeat terrorism in all continents in the next century. I think it is a huge deal for all the people of the world. Quickly, on the Tokyo thing, are we going to settle that before the date of imposition of tariffs? Well, that is up to Japan. Strictly up to Japan, no more meetings? Well, we will be-we are prepared to meet and talk, I think, but look-- What is the date, June what-24th? Let me say-I have worked with four Japanese governments. We have succeeded in pushing through a new world trade agreement. We have gotten, I think, 14 specific agreements with Japan, including agreements to import rice. But the real problem with the Japanese-American trade relationship, and with the Japanese trade relationship with many other countries, is autos and auto parts. It is 60 percent of our trade deficit with Japan. And we know we are competitive in price and quality. And we know there are indirect problems that are not covered by the specific letter of normal trade agreements. So we have to be firm here. I have done everything I could for 2 1/2 years to have a good, constructive, friendly relationship with Japan. We are allies, we are friends, but we must be firm on this. I was watching television yesterday, and I saw an advertisement saying, Free trade-these firm moves against Japan are a terrible mistake. And then at the end of the commercial, it said, Paid for by Japanese Auto Association. And I would just say to them that if they, in any way, misjudge the strength and resolve of ENTITY in pursuing this, they are making a serious mistake, because they are the ones that are acting contrary to what it would take to have more-- You are not going to give on this, is what you are saying. We want to open the market. We do not even-we just want to open the market. Let me say for the benefit of the Americans who are watching this, this is in Japan's interest as well. Japan has suffered from low growth. The Japanese people have apparently higher incomes than the American people, but their living standards are lower because they pay about 40 percent more for consumer products. Are you saying their leaders are letting them down? I am saying that their ingrained institutional resistance to change is not only hurting the American working people, it is hurting the Japanese people. What you are looking at now is the front of the White House, which is becoming a mall or an esplanade. No cars anymore on Pennsylvania Avenue because of security threats. There are the barricades. You have to go in through the side; you cannot go in through the front anymore. Tragedy? Well, I wish it had not been necessary. But the truth is that, so far, it is increasing public access to the White House, and it has not interrupted traffic too much. On the weekends now, the whole Pennsylvania Avenue is just flooded with people. They are riding bikes; they are skating; they are skateboarding; they are on rollerblades. Is this going to be like an esplanade? It is going to be like-- We want it to be a big public space. You know, in a time of less security consciousness back in the thirties, the back lawn of the White House, the large back lawn, used to be open every Sunday in the spring and summer for ordinary citizens to go and picnic and sort of be there in the atmosphere of it. Now we can do that in the front because of what is happened. I wish it had not been necessary, but we are going to make something good come of this. There is a difference between access for people and access for cars and trucks. And actually, this space is more accessible to people now. Where is your terrorism bill? Flying in the Senate, stopped in the House? Well, ENTITY's been working extremely hard on that, and I have to tell you-he will not say this the same way I do- I would personally like to say I am very frustrated with what the House of Representatives is doing. ENTITY's made it clear why this is necessary for our country, and it is not right for the House of Representatives to sit on this because some of the Members of Congress are scared that some of these antigovernment sentiments are so strong that they will be expressed against them if they increase the ability of the Government to fight against lawbreakers. I'd like to say, though, that this is not just a-this is not necessarily a partisan deal. Senator Dole, so far as we speak tonight, has done what he is said he'd do. He asked me and the Democratic leadership to try to reduce the number of amendments offered by the Democrats. He said he'd try to reduce the number of amendments offered by Republicans. They did that today. They adopted a major amendment that I wanted to put taggants in illegal explosives, or explosives that could be held illegally, so we could trace them. They are moving that bill. And it seems to me that we are moving in the right direction in the Senate. I was quite disturbed at the people in the House saying, Well, maybe we ought to go slow on this. Look, I had an antiterrorism bill in the Congress 2 months before Oklahoma for foreign terrorists. Then the FBI and others said, We'd like some changes to deal with domestic terrorism, and we presented that. The bill is moving in the Senate. It must move in the House. We cannot go slow on it. We cannot . What is stopping you in the House? Well, we do not know. Nothing has happened yet. We hope, if we can get this bill out of the Senate, that the House will then move rapidly. What has Mr. Gingrich said about it? Well, he said that they might have to go slow. And the terrorists are not going slow. So you are saying tonight to the House, get a move on? Look, this is a big deal, and this should not be partisan. And I know that some of these groups that hate the Government think that their civil liberties may be infringed here. The Congress has the right, indeed, the responsibility, to review the provisions of this act, but not to go slow. The people who do this terrorist work, they operate on their own timetable; they do not sit around and wait for Congress to enact laws. We know that we can do a better job in stopping things from happening. Let me say, in spite of the horror of Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center, our people stopped another planned bombing in New York, stopped a plan to explode some airplanes flying out of the West Coast airports over the Pacific. We can do more of this. In Israel now, with all of their problems with terrorism, they head off the vast majority of terrorist threats. We can prevent this, but we are not used to dealing with it. We need more tools. That is what this legislation is for, and we cannot delay. Are we still investigating Oklahoma City heavily? Oh, yes. ENTITY put together-let me just expand on that briefly. , immediately following the explosion in Oklahoma City, without a moment's delay, was on the telephone to the Attorney General, the FBI, and the law enforcement community. And from the first half-hour, you saw assembled the most impressive law enforcement team ever put together in the history of the United States of America. I was there last week, watching them comb through every piece of the rubble of that building, down to pieces this big, getting every scrap of evidence that they could possibly find. It is an incredibly impressive operation. Do you believe it was just two people? I believe we should let the investigation unfold. In this segment, concerning legislation, there is apparently a confusion over whether you are for or against an amendment regarding habeas corpus. Well, in addition to the antiterrorism legislation, we have been trying to pass, and I tried to pass last year and failed to do it, a bill which would reform the habeas corpus procedure, the criminal appeals procedure. So? In death penalty cases, it normally takes 8 years to exhaust the appeals; it is ridiculous. And if you have multiple convictions, it could take even longer. So there is a strong sense in the Congress, I think among Members of both parties, that we need to get down to sort of one clear appeal, we need to cut the time delay on the appeals dramatically, and that it ought to be done in the context of this terrorism legislation so that it would apply to any prosecutions brought against anyone indicted in Oklahoma. And I think it ought to be done. You know, we have some differences about exactly what the details are and what the best and fairest way to do-to apply to all criminal cases, but I think it definitely ought to be done. We have-for 15 years, I have been trying to get Congress to clarify this. And I have strongly believed it for a very long time, since I was an attorney general and a Governor and I had been on the receiving end of these interminable appeals. Are there those in Congress who think you are against this? There are some in both parties who, in good conscience, think it would cause problems for a criminal procedure. Constitutionally. Well, they are worried about it. But ENTITY's for it. And if they want to put the right version of it on this bill, fine. There are some good and bad-we do not have time to get into all of the details of it. There are things that I like better in some versions than others. But you are , in essence, for it? I am not only for it, we need to do it. You cannot justify this lengthy appeals process. Are we going to have the full Waco story come out? Yes, but I think we already have had it. I mean, after all, we had an independent panel review what the ATF people did there. We have already had 10 congressional hearings on Waco. And I think the American people should remember that. I'd just like to remind you of the facts. There was action taken based on mistakes made. There is new leadership at the ATF. The facts were made known of what they did and the FBI did and others did, and there were 10 congressional hearings last year. If they want to have other hearings, fine. But let us not lose the forest for the trees here. All this renewed interest in Waco came up by people who were worried about the fact that there would be a renewed interest in exploring the kind of militant groups that the suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing was involved with. So if they want to look into Waco, fine, but let us not forget what the real problem is here. The real problem is what happened at Oklahoma City. At Waco, whatever else the facts are, it is clear there was a valid warrant. The people in the cult shot first and killed innocent Federal law enforcement officials. When the FBI went after them, based on their best available intelligence at the time, they killed the children there- the people there, not the Federal officials-the people in the cult did. And when they finally had their place inspected, what did we find? We found illegal machine guns, illegal explosives, and the capacity to build another 100 high-caliber illegal machine guns. And Koresh shot his way into the leadership of the cult. So there is a lot of historical revision going on here to take people's attention off Oklahoma City. People often ask, what do you talk about during breaks? We were talking about movies. Now, normally that would be considered inconsequential, except movies are suddenly political. Okay, what do you make of Bob Dole and the charges that-well, I will tell you something he said yesterday. He said, Mr. Clinton will not criticize the movies like I do because if he needs a million dollars, he has to go to Hollywood. And he said, If he needs $2 million, he has to go see Barbra Streisand, and she has to put on a concert. She will be here tomorrow night, so I mentioned that. Your thoughts on Mr. Dole. Well, first of all, if I had any criticism it would be that the whole thing has been politicized, like in those comments you made. The truth is, I was talking about violence and-in rap music and movies in 1992, in 1993. I went to Hollywood and met with a bunch of the people in production and challenged them to reduce it. I met with people-the members of-the representatives of television networks and challenged them. And I talked about it-if you remember, I got a big standing ovation in the State of the Union Address, talking about it. So you agree with Senator Dole? So I think it is an absolutely legitimate point for discussion. Tipper Gore, years ago, long before there was any politics in it, was talking about how we needed to take-- Labeling records. Yes, and to take-and to just- so that people could know whether these things were consistent with what you'd want young children to see and hear. I do not believe in censorship, and I do not believe in singling Hollywood out. What I believe we need to do is to say to ourselves, what has happened to our ability to have an American community that raises good citizens with good values, who are-who grow up into good people? That these kids-how do we reduce the teen violence? How do we reduce-- They are saying that Hollywood contributes to it. Well, I think-and I think that is -I think excessive exposure to mindnumbing violence or crass abuse of people in sexual and other ways has a bad impact on young children, especially if they do not have the kind of structure and other leadership in their life that they need. But what I would say is that we need to ask ourselves: What does the entertainment community need to do? What does the media need to do? What does the business community need to do? What does the religious community need to do? What do the politicians need to do? What is our contribution to all this? That is, my only quarrel with all this is I do not want to see it politicized. I agree with a lot of what Senator Dole said. I do not know about the specific movies; I had not seen most of the ones he mentioned. But I think that we need to do this in a spirit not of dividing each other but of asking everybody to come forward and be accountable. Is the rap on Time-Warner fair? Well, I think that they have put out a lot of material that they should not have. And it is not true that this administration has not talked about it. In fact, there was a public back-and-forth when one of their properties had some inappropriate material on President Reagan's Alzheimer's disease, and we said, Hey, wait a minute. And they pulled it back. And I give them credit for that. And there have been other examples. And let me say this: My wife, Tipper, began working on this and talking about this 18 years ago. And a few years after that, she began to get criticized from all parts. Before they were in the White House, Bill and Hillary Clinton were among the few who stood up and said, We support what Tipper Gore is saying about this. And it took some doing, but she succeeded in getting the voluntary system of labeling for records. But she is continued talking about it. And she and I have appreciated the fact that this is the first President to talk about this in the State of the Union Address, to go to Hollywood and make a speech about it, and to take on this phenomenon in a responsible way, not in a partisan way. Are you also against violent movies that Mr. Dole did not mention, like True Lies, let us say, a Schwarzenegger movie that had a lot of violence? Well, let me say-I do not want to get into critiquing every movie. There have been about 3,000 studies of the impact of constant exposure to violence on children through television and through the movies. Almost all of them, not all but almost all of them, conclude that what is really bad is the aggregate impact of it, the total volume of it, plus the treatment of violence as something casual and crass. Everyday-- Like you and I were talking about Braveheart. That is a violent movie, but it does not glorify violence. It is ugly, and it is awful. Now, I feel that we ought to go after this in a responsible way. I was not upset when Senator Dole raised this issue. I just do not think any of us ought to be doing it as a way of sort of dividing the American people. You know, we ought to get on this-a friend of mine said today, we need to get on the solution side of these problems. We need to challenge Hollywood. Most of these people, they are good people out there. They want to do the right thing. And we are not talking about censorship; we are talking about responsible, honest debate. We all have to say, what contribution are we making to creating an America that is too divided, that does not raise good children with strong values who are good, law-abiding citizens when they grow up? We will be back. We will include some phone calls for ENTITY and ENTITY of the United States right after this. Timeth flieth. We are moving along. Let us take a call. Jameson, Pennsylvania, for ENTITY and ENTITY. Hello. Good evening. Thank you, Larry, for the opportunity. You are welcome. Good evening, ENTITY and ENTITY Gore. This is indeed an honor. Like you, ENTITY, I saw President Kennedy when I was younger, and it has sparked my interest in studying the Presidency. Ma'am, I wish you would get right to the question. I do not mean to interrupt, but we have long-- My question is, I respect the Presidency of the United States, and I think it is an important job. How frustrating is it for you to try to get your message out to the people when it seems like the opposing party is criticizing you constantly? What do you make of the daily hate? There is a lot of hate in America. There is, and I would say to her, I do not mind the daily criticism. What I do not like and do not agree with is the sort of atmosphere of negativism and cynicism. That is, I should be criticized by people who disagree with me; we should have an honest debate. That is really the way you make progress in this country. But we have gotten to be entirely too negative and cynical and divisive, and that is one of our country's big problems. We need to get out of being quite so partisan and quite so personal and quite so interested in the destruction of our opponents. This country, with all of its problems, no other country would trade places with us as we get ready to go into this new century, because our productivity, the strength of our people, the wealth of our resources, the diversity of our population in a global economy-if we can just figure out a way to restore middle class dreams and middle class values and pull this country together, there is no stopping the United States. So I say to the lady, it bothers me not to be criticized, but it bothers me that there is an atmosphere that is more negative than positive. America should be more positive than negative. A couple of political things. Do you think Senator Dole will be your opponent? I do not know. I do not know. Do you think so? It looks that way now, but it is impossible to tell. It is so far off. I do not know. One thing I have learned watching this for 30 years, is you cannot tell now who will be there then. Mr. Gingrich will be in New Hampshire all weekend; so will you. You will be there for Dartmouth on Sunday. Do you think he might enter the race? That is just a thought. You know, just three people talking. I do not know. You have got to ask him. I really do not know. I talk to him all the time, but not about this. Would you regard it as a challenge if he did? Do you think he will -- Well, it would be interesting. Of course, he'd have to be nominated first. But it would be interesting. Senator-Mr. ENTITY? I am so used to calling him-- I am still in the-- I know, you are still in the Senate. I am still in the Senate. And you know, the experience of voting in the Senate's made me a more optimistic person, because I have noticed that every time I vote, we win. Good line. But to answer your question, I do not know. It sounds-- Would it be formidable? You know, we are not going to rank any potential opponents for ENTITY Anybody who got the nomination would be, by definition, the nominee of the other party and formidable. But it sounds to me like he kind of wants to, but maybe I have it wrong, and I have no idea. Mr. Perot has called a meeting in Dallas with his large group. He says every Republican candidate has agreed to go. Will you go? I am inclined not to go, because I have a lot of respect for the United We Stand group, and I hope that they will review my record in terms of what they said they wanted done in 1992, because I have done or advocated a vast majority of what they did. But I do not believe-I think ENTITY's in a little different category. I do not think ENTITY should start the politicking too soon. I have got a job; I am supposed to be working for the American people. I am trying to work with this new Republican Congress, and I want to diminish partisan politics and my personal politics for as long as I can. Therefore, you will ask the ENTITY not to go, either? We have not even discussed it. I am telling you what my instinct is. I do not plan to go. I think that the party chair has already expressed his intention to go. He will go? Yes. Surgeon General Nominee Henry Foster Foster, is he going to go through? I think he will. I think we are very close to having the votes to break filibuster, and I think a filibuster would be wrong. He is a good man. He cleared the committee; he was treated fairly, in a bipartisan way. He had all those kids from Tennessee from those housing projects come up and say, Here is a guy that told us to abstain from premature sex, to stay off drugs, to be good people. That is the message we need going out to America's children. Is Senator Dole going to bring it to the floor? I hope he will. Nobody in America is better qualified to lead a crusade against this epidemic of teen pregnancy. And you think they will override a Gramm filibuster if it comes to the floor? I do not see how a majority of the Senate, even 60 percent of them, could say this man's not entitled to a vote, up or down. We are back. The Republican National Committee sent out a news release today, Haley Barbour talking about your appearance tonight on this program and saying, 3 years ago on this show you promised the American people you would offer a plan to balance the budget. Do you have such a plan? Well, as you know, I have said that I will work with the Republicans to balance the budget. And at the proper time, I will offer how I think the best way to do is. But let us just point out, in 1994, the Republicans told the American people all I did was raise taxes. And they basically turned things upside down; they won the Congress. But what we did, in fact, was to use their 7-year number. We reduced the deficit by a trillion dollars 3 years in a row for the first time since Truman was President. They talked about how terrible it was, but it produced low interest rates, high growth, 6.3 million new jobs. And I might say to the American people, the Republican plan does not repeal my plan, it builds on it. If they did not take the deficit reduction we'd already achieved, they could never get to a balance in 7 years or any other figure. So you say we are going to have something from you after-- So I think-I will be happy to work with them, but I want-I thought it was important, after they won the election on a set of specific promises, that they have a chance to go and say how they thought it should be done. Now, you know what I think is wrong with their budget. I think that it cuts Medicare and other health programs to the elderly way too much. It cuts education too much. It uses those cuts to finance a tax cut that is entirely too large and tilted to upper income individuals who are doing very well in the present economy and who basically just want us to get the deficit down. So, we need to do this, but there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. And at the proper time, I will say what I think the right way is. And the proper time is imminent or not imminent? I will do it when I think the proper time is. Dana Point, California, with ENTITY Gore and ENTITY-hello. Hi, Larry. I enjoy your show. My name is Michelle Denise. Also, I'd like you to know I enjoy Jerry Spence. Everybody does. He is an international hero, Jerry Spence. He is quite a character. He looks good in those jackets. Does not he? Boy. This trial is going forever, right? Okay. This question is both for Mr. Clinton and Gore. Are we going to continue our military base closures in consideration that we might possibly be spreading ourselves too thin-- Any chance of that? Well, the base closure procedure is locked into law. It is bipartisan in nature. It has caused a lot of difficulty. ENTITY has directed his Cabinet to address the problems that have been created. There have been some very imaginative plans to try to use some of these facilities for other purposes and bring back employment and new opportunities in the community. But this was put into place long before we got here, and according to the law, it is going to continue for a while. But let me answer the security concern the lady raised. Defense spending peaked in about 1987 and since then has been cut about 40 percent. We have suggested that we add back a few billion dollars so we can get our training and our readiness up and support a good quality of life so we can keep firstrate people in the military, because it is the people that make it go. The answer to your question, ma'am, is that we actually have more base capacity than the number of our men and women in uniform would justify. So we have to bring down the bases a little more so that they are basically in line with the size of our forces. The size of our forces now will enable to meet our security needs and meet our strategic objectives. But we cannot cut it a lot more. We should stay about where we are. Barbra Streisand is here tomorrow night. And are you both fans of hers? Do you like her speaking out on politics, by the way? I think she is -just as-if we have a right to speak out on entertainment, I think she has the right to speak out on politics. I think that she should do it. David Letterman is here on Friday. Tell him I said hello. I will. Do you plan to return to that show? I hope to sometime. Would you recommend ENTITY even appear with David? I am going to let him make that decision. But you know, since we got this procurement reform passed, there are no more of those $10 ashtrays and $500 hammers. So he is got no gig anymore. Thanks, guys. You do not want to do a Brando close, do you? Just a handshake. Just a handshake. We have enjoyed doing the show. Oh, let me-here-ENTITY does Brando. Do it once. You missed it. It is been great being on your show, Larry. Thank you. You are a good man; you have got a real future in this business. Thank you. Thank you. Good night. Good night.

{"id": 541, "text": "We are grateful-the bureau chief has deferred to me to let me ask the first question. And first of all, I'd like to say we are grateful that you have taken the time to meet with us today. And if-since I know your time is very limited, we'd like to just get started right now. ENTITY, some Members of Congress are proposing a delay in military aid to the contras to allow time for another attempt to draw the Sandinistas into negotiations with the contras. Would you accept some delay-if not 6 months, which I know you do not want-but some delay in providing military aid if that meant Congress would approve your request? Well, I think there is several ways in which things like that are being suggested. First of all, from the time that they would-if they would vote to approve this aid, there would be a period of time before it would actually be carried out. And, yes, if there is any possibility that during that time, and perhaps to forestall such aid, that they would then be willing to come to the negotiating table-as we have tried to get them nine times already-and to negotiate with the contras, that'd be fine. But if we are talking about some kind of a compromise where the Congress imposes a delay and takes the trigger away from me in- You mean like requiring a second vote? Yes, there would be a second vote and so forth, I think this would be most counterproductive because the Sandinistas would feel they could hang on longer with the hope that we still would not get what we are asking for. It sounds like the trigger is the problem. If, for example, a delay of, say, 60 to 75 days, after which the aid would go whether-without a second congressional vote, does that seem like the basis for a compromise to you? Well, I'd be willing to talk to them about something of this kind. I would not want to commit to this because, as I say, the important thing is that the Sandinista government must not be left any loopholes in which they believe there still might be a denial of this help. So, your real problem is the trigger in the second vote? Yes, yes. They have to know that we mean it and that we are going to help the contras. ENTITY, some administration officials have said that 18 months of military aid to the contras is all that will be needed to bring the Sandinistas to the negotiating table and that you will not be back for more. Alfonso Robelo, one of the contra leaders who you met with here last week, has said he does not feel that anything more than 18 months would be needed, and he did not feel that they would want to prolong the bloodshed there beyond that. What happens after 18 months and the contras have still not forced the Sandinistas to the negotiating table? Well, I think this is something that you have to look at if such a time should come. But I am pleased that those men who are most familiar with the resources of the contras have that feeling. They are acquainted with their ability. There is no question that when we were able to give them some help, the contras were giving the Sandinista forces great problems. But you have got to remember that for the last couple of years, other than the humanitarian aid, they were shut off. And that is why they are so limited in the numbers. They have got a potential force of around 25,000. There are about 6,000 now fighting in Nicaragua. But this is a matter of the lack of arms and munitions. Well, it does sound, Mr. ENTITY, that you are not saying that 18 months is necessarily the end of it and you might, in fact, have to come back for more. Is that correct? I would-yes, I think it would be foolish to commit yourself to anything of that kind because this, too, then could stiffen the Sandinistas' resistance and say all we have to do is hold out for 18 months. Mr. ENTITY, you have said that the overriding issue in Central America is America's national security. You have also said, if I may quote: We send money and material now so we will never have to send our own American boys. Is it possible that someday American troops will have to be sent? Well, here is the thing everyone is overlooking. Here is this third Communist-well, let-I cannot call it an attempt. Here would be the third of the bases that they had established, the Communist bloc, and the first one on our mainland. And they, themselves, have made it plain that they are part of the expansionist philosophy, that Marxian philosophy and belief of a one-world Communist state. Now, what you have to say is, if we do nothing and this is allowed to grow and expand and carry its revolution across other borders, then the threat would remain that there would come a day when their hostilities would be directed at our own interests. And that is the time in which you could say that, yes, then American forces would be involved because the hostilities were directed at us. I do not see it, as some interpret it, that, well, we are leaving the door open; that we may still use troops down there. I do not think we'd have a friend left in Latin America if we used American forces. The image of the great colossus of the North is still too much in their minds. The contras do not want us. They want our help, they want the tools. They have made it plain; they will furnish the manpower. So when I said three, I noticed you kind of paused and looked at each other there. Let me point out something that everyone is neglecting up there on the Hill to pay attention to. When we, in the Grenada operation, got possession of all those documents, as well as the arms and the weapons that were already installed in Grenada by the Soviet bloc, we got documents from the Soviet Government, from the Cuban Government addressed to the Communists there in Grenada. And over and over again they referred to that they had Cuba, they had Nicaragua, they had Grenada, and then they went on to discuss what the future goals were and the other targets there in Central America and the Caribbean. So that there was no question about this being a target for Soviet expansionism, using proxies the way they have now with Cuba and all. So the goal is made very plain. Now, this last-again, this threat that a Nicaragua could pose, when I was in Grenada the nine Prime Ministers of the tiny Caribbean island nations unanimously-and they brought it up, I was not even discussing this subject. They brought it up to me. They said, You must continue helping the rebels in Nicaragua because this Nicaragua, under this government, is the greatest threat to our existence, to those nine nations. So, we are not the only ones that see this as a cancer that must be excised. Now, as part of the request to Congress for aid to the contras, there is a provision that would allow the use of CIA contingency funds, and I was wondering, on top of the $100 million that you are asking, I was wondering, well, why is the use of these funds considered necessary, and what would they be used for? Well, because under restrictions that have already been put on us by Congress, we cannot give advice, we cannot offer training, we cannot exchange intelligence information with the contras. And we feel that if we are going to help them with weapons and arms that we ought to be freed of those restrictions and allowed to provide this other assistance to them. I see. By that other assistance, do you mean additional funding over and above the $100 million? No, it is not that as much as it is-well, or whatever the cost might be and being able to give them military intelligence and help with military planning. One of the conditions, sir, the United States has set for Nicaragua is the holding of free elections. If free elections were held and the Sandinistas won, would we accept the result? I think we'd have to. This would-then we'd be back to a case similar to the Philippines in which the whole goal of the revolution and of the negotiations would be a government that would be chosen by the people of Nicaragua. Remember that the contras are supporting a guarantee that was given to the Organization of American States of what the revolution against Somoza was supposed to gain. They provided that information to the Organization of American States when they asked the Organization to try and persuade Somoza to step down to end the killing. And he did. But before they asked him to, the Organization asked the revolutionaries to give them what were their revolutionary goals. And they were provided, and the goals were a pluralistic, democratic society, free speech, freedom of religion-all the things that go with democracy. And it was the Sandinistas, as one faction of the revolution, that ousted their fellow revolutionaries when they got control-took over and installed a totalitarian, Communist regime. Now, the contras say what they want is to get back to the original goal which requires letting the people of that country make the decisions to how they want to be governed. Mr. ENTITY, in your current campaign to try to raise votes for the contra aid next week, you and some of your aides have been emphasizing that the people who do not support you on this are going to be held accountable by history, or by whomever, for their failure to back you up on it. And my question is since this includes a lot of Republicans, as well as Democrats, whether you are going to be unwilling to support in the coming congressional election those people who do not support you on this vote? No, and I think-let me-no, I think the thing has been-that whole question has kind of been exaggerated into assailing the motives of the people that would vote against us. Well, we are not doing anything of the kind. What we are pointing out is what I said earlier-that the choice here is either negotiations leading to a political settlement or this cancer continuing to grow. What we are trying to point out is that this is not an argument about two methods of dealing with the problem-if one wanted to do one thing and wanted another, but the goals were the same. What we are trying to make them realize is that it is an either/or situation. Either we are able to press them into negotiating and coming to a political settlement or they remain a Communist base, another Cuba. Does that mean you will not have any political hard feelings toward Republicans who do not back you up on this? Well, I think I'd better-I'd just better swallow hard and not answer a question like that. Mr. ENTITY, in reaction to your order that the Soviets have to reduce their mission at the United Nations, the Soviets have sent up a formal protest note and said that such actions as that do not create the climate for a summit. Do you have any comment on that? Well, yes. So far we have not heard-or I have not certainly heard of anything from the General Secretary. But remember, this is not like an Embassy where there is retaliation or-this is the one place, the United Nations-and it is the only one, and it is here in our country. And they have a delegation that is larger than the next two delegations, to them put together. And there is no way that you can justify the size of their delegation here except that they have other goals than just the- In other words, they are spies. Is that what you are saying, Mr. ENTITY? Yes, and I think that we have enough knowledge of their actions to know that they are there for that purpose-for other purposes and for espionage, not for the doings of the United Nations. Mr. ENTITY, it does seem, though, that the promise of Geneva just 6 months ago is largely unfulfilled right now-arms control talks have bogged down, there is inability to set the date for a new summit, and now the staff reductions. Has a new chill entered U.S.-Soviet relations? No, this project has been on our minds for quite some time. The arms talks-I still continue to be hopeful because the General Secretary in his proposals-this is the first time I can recall any Soviet leader actually being willing to eliminate weapons they already have. And we in turn accepted a great many of their figures and their proposals, but there were-it is a complicated thing because we do not both have the same numbers of the same kinds of weapons, and so we then put in some-taking their proposal in which, as I say, in overall terms: 50-percent reduction, ultimate elimination, and so forth-we accepted. We put in some other things that we thought were essential to such a program, and there were no further negotiations. In other words, they have, at the moment, seem to be in a position in which we accept their offer entirely or else. And we think that negotiations mean that you try to find a common meeting ground on some differences that you may have in there on figures. And we have not had a response. We put before our people there in Geneva the framework for meeting their proposal and with some changes that we felt should be made because of fairness and expediting the program, and we have had no response. Well, I mean, is it your sense, though, that this 6 months' post-summit period has been as hopeful as you had thought it might be, or has it, in fact, been something of a downer for you, a disappointment? Well, we did not come home with any euphoria or anything from that meeting. We did come home pleased with the fact that they had agreed and shown an agreement to have future meetings. We do not think that is been done away with. But also, we have had people over there-Charlie Wick has had people with him over there on the matter of exchange, cultural exchange and youth exchange, and all of this. And apparently they were better meetings than we have ever had in the past with them. He met with officials at extremely high levels. They were most enthusiastic about wanting to go forward with these exchanges, so-and the fact that I have a communications channel to the General Secretary. No, I think that the conditions are better than they had been before. Mr. ENTITY, the General Secretary links a summit and progress on arms control and, on the other hand, does not seem to have loosened the strings on his negotiators in Geneva. Do you think that Mr. Gorbachev really wants an arms control agreement, and do you think he really wants a summit meeting this year? I have to say his willingness and his eagerness to have us come there in the following year leads me to believe that nothing has changed on that. With regard to arms control, yes, because I think he is very much aware of the economic situation in his country and the part that their massive military buildup has played in that economic problem. And I think that he would much prefer to have practical arms agreements, arms reduction agreements, rather than to face a continued arms race. Sir, may I ask you, have you a deadline for setting the date for a summit meeting? Must it be done, for example, before you go to the economic summit meeting? No, I have not asked for that kind of a deadline. We have made it plain to them that it would be very difficult, inconvenient for us to-the one hint that was put out by them of possibly September or later-well, we have an election in our country. Now, I know they do not understand our elections as much as they should, not having free elections of their own. But we have explained that it must be earlier, before we actually get into the full extent of that election campaign. Is it at all possible that you could meet after the election? I do not -we have not -I suppose, but by that time we are getting pretty late in the year. We'd listen to that and look at it. I had not thought about anything after that time. But your preference is still June or July? Or July, yeah. Mr. ENTITY, may I ask you a question about the Strategic Defense Initiative? If some parts of it prove feasible earlier than others, would you be in favor of deploying those parts when they are feasible, such as the ground-based protection of our Minuteman and MX missiles? I'd have to seriously think about that, because I have already said, and I told General Secretary Gorbachev, that we viewed this as a defense for all of mankind and as something that could really make it possible and practical for the elimination of nuclear weapons every place. To go forward with a deployment without a lot of further meetings and exchanges would then appear that we might be seeking to get a first-strike advantage. And I think that would be the most dangerous thing in the world, for either one of us to be seen as having the capacity for a first strike. So your inclination would be to wait until the whole thing is both feasible and negotiable? Or if whatever, as you say, in part, became feasible, okay, then go earlier to both our allies and to the others and say, Look, here is the potential now for this weapon and we want it to be used for all mankind, and see what we could work out. Mr. ENTITY, one other thing, you have spoken of a proportional response to the Soviets' treaty violations as you see them. And yet you have not announced that response yet. Are we about to have it sprung on us soon? Well- - Have you decided? We have not sat down actually with regard to theirs and what our response would be. But this one, on this one, this only has to deal with the SALT II. Yes. The other thing, the nuclear test ban, this one, we are willing to meet them on that except that we cannot get a satisfactory answer yet on real verification. Now, we have offered to let them come here with whatever equipment they wanted to bring and be witness to one of our underground tests. This is a treaty where we think they have been in violation. It is rather difficult to determine from the great distance whether they have exceeded the agreement on the size of the explosion. And we would want better verification before we go forward with some of these. Well, could we be sure of the safety and reliability of our weapons if we abandon all testing, if there were a comprehensive ban? No, I think the greatest-here is where again that their proposal is unfair to us. It is in the time that they set. They are ahead of us in modernizing and expanding their weapon systems, developing new ones. We are still playing catchup. They have tested and are now deploying their modernized and their newer weapons. For us to stop where we are still playing catchup, leaves us in a position of increased inferiority to them. And it would not be fair for us until we have made the same tests comparatively with our-that they have made with their new and improved, modernized weapons. Then we could talk, but with better verification than we now have-we could talk such a test ban. Mr. ENTITY, on the space shuttle disaster, our paper had a story last week that the White House had issued a national security decision directive in 1984 which targeted 24 shuttle missions a year and operating in the black for the shuttle program. Do you believe that the kind of pressure that that put on the shuttle program could have been, in any way, responsible for what happened down there? No, and we have never done anything except to approve their schedule. They have told us what they were capable of doing, and I have put out a thing like-that we want it by a certain time down the years here, if possible to have a manned space station. And this is a program that I have announced, and they were to go after it, but we have never, ever-and I-some of those rumors that came out that we had insisted on this particular launching. We have never from here suggested or pushed them for a launch of the shuttle. I would-good Lord, I would feel that I was way out of my depth in trying to do that. I am not a scientist and they are. They are the judge of that. Immediately after this happened, you responded to your conversations with the families of some of the victims and said that you were determined that the program would go forward. In view of things that have been discovered by your commission since then, and in view of some of the statements by the astronauts themselves that they had serious reservations about the safety of the program based on what they'd learned-two things: Do you think that the public relations aspect of it in which teachers, journalists, and others would go along should be continued or curtailed under those circumstances? Well, we want the program. When I responded to the-I responded to the families. Every family, those people that I talked to, in their conversation, they made it plain to me that they felt this program had to continue; that this was what their loved ones, now departed, would have wanted. And they wanted me to tell them, and I told them, yes, it will. Yes, we have no intention of canceling the program because of this tragedy. You know, when you look at it, you have 24 times right and i accident, i wrong-you cannot cancel out the program. But I have also said since, and we have all agreed here, that now that these things are coming out, that the program must rectify all these shortcomings that had never before been mentioned so that we know that the safety factor that should be there is there. Well, do you think that those civilians should still be allowed to, considering all that? Oh, yes, you asked about that. Yes. You know, from the very beginning-almost the very beginning, once we established that it was practical-there have been people up there conducting experiments-scientists, for example, who are not astronauts, but who are there to carry on the great advances that have come to us by way of those shuttle experiments-in medicine and other things-are so great that I do not see any reason why this policy should not continue. And so you think that teachers and journalists and those should go, too? I think that all of them-you have to look at each one to see, does it have some value or is it just publicity? Everything that is been done so far, there seemed to be a logical value in this. You know, here we have a privately supported junior astronaut program in our country that is become quite a feature of our educational system and all. And so, I think you could-I think the teacher thing had a value. But I think that every case should be looked at as to what was the possible value of having a civilian along. But I do not think we should just blanket it that only astronauts are going up there to loose satellites and do things of that kind. The experiments that can be conducted and the things that we have learned from that program, things that have to do with heart ailments, the possibility that we now have of a medicine for the first time to cure diabetes that can only be produced in outer space. Well, do you think we should build a new shuttle to replace Challenger or lay off some of those assignments on unmanned missions? I have not had a chance to talk with the people involved there about three and what the difference would be between three and four myself. And I would be more or less inclined to go by the information that they might have as to what would be the setback in having 25 percent of the flying force eliminated. Could I just-you could use the word shortcomings, Mr. ENTITY, you said shortcomings that have come out in the course of this investigation. Is it your feeling at this point now, after having seen what has evolved in the course of the Presidential Commission's study that in fact there were shortcomings in the way that NASA has handled this particular I think I am going to-all I know are the things that we keep hearing about. I am going to have to wait until I actually hear from the Commission and their evaluation of what they have learned and the fact that astronauts have said there were other potential liabilities that they had become aware of. Let us read out on all of those. We do know now that, while we are still waiting to have it actually declared what was the cause of this tragedy, we still know that the rings on those two particular rockets are affected by cold. Experiments have revealed that. So, whether that turns out to be the ultimate cause or not, it ought to be something that we find an answer to. It does appear, though, that what is transpired in the aftermath of the tragedy has been concern on your part about procedures, if not knowing for sure, but concern, is that true? Yeah. I would-I think what-or as far as anyone can know, you know. There is a limit beyond which you cannot go. Anyone who gets in an airplane knows that, that there are things that can happen. Mr. ENTITY, thank you for your time, sir. Well, thank you. I think I will leave that to you, or I am going to tear my - Linda Chavez Mr. ENTITY, are you going to make it over to Maryland to campaign for your former staffer, Linda Chavez? Well, she- with the nomination first. Oh- -get you into that. No, I cannot participate in primaries. Thanks a lot. I did have to ask this last question: Have you ever sent out for Chinese food in this place? I have always wanted.- No. Have you ever wanted to?

{"id": 169, "text": "I have to start with last night and ask you how you are feeling about the election of Donald Trump. Could you believe what you were seeing? Were you blown away like the rest of us? And how are you feeling now? Well, I am disappointed, partly because I think Hillary Clinton would be a very fine president. As I said on the campaign trail, a lot of the work we have done is only partially complete. And we need some continuity in order for us to maximize its benefits. Did you ever think this was possible? Did this result ever occur to you? I will tell you, New Hampshire, 2008, I had just won Iowa and had this whirlwind tour of New Hampshire, huge rallies, huge crowds, and our internal pollster had us up by 10. And around 7:30, as I am putting on my clothes to deliver my victory speech, I get a knock on the door by David Plouffe, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs. And they have got sheepish looks on their faces. And they say, Barack, we have some interesting news for you. We do not think we are gonna win this thing. That is the thing about democracy. That is the thing about voting. It does not mean polls are irrelevant, but there is always a human variable involved in this. So I think the odds of Donald Trump winning were always around 20 percent. That seem like a lot, but one out of five is not that unusual. It is not a miracle. But are not you feeling chagrined, pissed off, upset, dismayed? Well, no. You know, I do not feel dismayed, because, number one, I could not be prouder of the work that we have done over the last eight years. When I turn over the keys to the federal government to the next president of the United States, I can say without any equivocation that the country is a lot better off: The economy is stronger, the federal government works better, and our standing in the world is higher. And so I can take great pride in the work we have done. I can take great satisfaction in the people we have helped. I do not want to sugarcoat it. There are consequences to elections. It means that the next Supreme Court justice is going to be somebody who does not reflect my understanding of the Constitution. It means that the work we have done internationally and domestically on climate is going to be threatened. It means that the Affordable Care Act, which has provided 20 million people with health insurance, is going to be modified in ways that some people are going to be hurt by. I think it does not take us all the way back to the status quo, because, despite the rhetoric, the Republicans are going to conclude that simply throwing millions of people off the rolls with no health insurance is not smart politics. But probably the main reason that I do not feel dismayed, but do feel disappointed, is the incredible young people who have worked in my administration, worked on our campaigns. If you look at the data from the election, if it were just young people who were voting, Hillary would have gotten 500 electoral votes. So we have helped, I think, shape a generation to think about being inclusive, being fair, caring about the environment. And they will have growing influence year by year, which means that America over time will continue to get better. You think it is still a progressive country? I think that nothing is determined, but that the number of people who have a strong belief in a fair, just, equal, inclusive America is the majority and is growing. And part of the challenge, though, that we do have, and this is something that I have been chewing on for a while now, is that there is a cohort of working-class white voters that voted for me in sizable numbers, but that we have had trouble getting to vote for Democrats in midterm elections. In this election, turned out in huge numbers for Trump. And I think that part of it has to do with our inability, our failure, to reach those voters effectively. Part of it is Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country, but part of it is also Democrats not working at a grassroots level, being in there, showing up, making arguments. That part of the critique of the Democratic Party is accurate. We spend a lot of time focused on international policy and national policy and less time being on the ground. And when we are on the ground, we do well. This is why I won Iowa. But how did the Democrats miss the white working class in such great numbers, who clearly had these big economic issues? They have lost their jobs in industrial states. It is not quite that simple, because this is not simply an economic issue. This is a cultural issue. And a communications issue. It is true that a lot of manufacturing has left or transformed itself because of automation. But during the course of my presidency, we added manufacturing jobs at historic rates, and think about it: In Michigan But, I mean Hold on. Let me finish. If you look at Michigan, which I won, not just in 2008 but in 2012, by a wide margin, we paid a lot of attention to manufacturing jobs, which is why the auto industry is on double shifts in plants that used to be shut down. If you look at minimum-wage laws or family-leave policy or the investments that we made in community colleges or, for that matter, the Affordable Care Act, these are all big investments for working families, white, black and Hispanic. The challenge we had is not that we have neglected these communities from a policy perspective. That is, I think, an incorrect interpretation. You start reading folks saying, Oh, you know, working-class families have been neglected, or Working-class white families have not been paid attention to by Democrats. Actually, they have. What is true, though, is that whatever policy prescriptions that we have been proposing do not reach, are not heard, by the folks in these communities. And what they do hear is Obama or Hillary are trying to take away their guns or they disrespect you. One of the challenges that we have been talking about now is the way social media and the Internet have changed what people receive as news. I was just talking to my political director, David Simas. He was looking at his Facebook page and some links from high school friends of his, some of whom were now passing around crazy stuff about, you know, Obama has banned the Pledge of Allegiance. I think it is really important for us, as progressives to set aside the Democratic Party as an institution, but just anybody who wants to see a more progressive America to think about how we are operating on the ground and showing up everywhere and fighting for the support of folks and giving them a concrete sense of what it is that we think will make their lives better, rather than depending on coming up with the right technocratic policies and sharing that with the New York Times editorial board. If we are not on the ground, and people are not hearing and seeing us face-to-face, then we will keep on losing, even though I genuinely believe that the Republican prescriptions are not going to be as helpful to these folks. So what do you think is the future of the Democratic Party? A month ago, everybody was convinced that the GOP was in its final death throes; now you have got three branches of government in the hands of one party. You have got voter suppression, which is guaranteed to continue, you have got redistricting, all these things. Where is the Democratic Party going? This seems to be a hard-right turn. Well, but there is not a hard-right turn. Take a look at, take a look at If you control three branches of government and you have got the Supreme Court If you survey the American people, including Trump voters, they are in favor of a higher minimum wage. They are in favor, in large numbers, of decriminalizing marijuana. They, I think, are, increasingly and with shocking speed, accepting of the need to treat the LGBT community with respect. They are hugely suspicious of Wall Street, hugely suspicious of the Establishment. Part of what Trump did, as well as Bernie, was run against that Establishment. Now the irony, of course, is that one would think Trump would be considered part of that Establishment and not a genuine outsider like Bernie was. So this does not seem to be a moment in which there is a huge turn to the right. What is true is that the ability of Republicans to win state elections, congressional elections and Senate elections is going to be a challenge for Democrats for a while, unless they can change perceptions about the Democratic Party and progressive causes in these rural or predominantly white areas, particularly in the Midwest. It is going to be harder to do in the South for a lot of historical reasons. With respect to the presidency, the Democrats still, actually, are in a better place and will continue to be in a better place than Republicans. This was always gonna be hard, because people get weary of one party after eight years. It is only happened once in modern history where we had that kind of clear transfer of power--or at least in the last 40, 50 years. I do not think that voter-suppression laws are gonna be the norm or gonna be the main problem that we have to deal with. We are not gonna be in a situation in which Democrats cannot win in any of these areas, but we are gonna have to reorganize ourselves more effectively. Look, in North Carolina, a state I won once by one point and a state I lost once by one point, a Democratic governor won in North Carolina despite Trump winning North Carolina. And part of the reason he won was North Carolinians were tired of a hard-right agenda by the sitting Republican governor, and these biased laws that had been passed directed at the LGBT community that people thought went too far. But part of the reason Roy Cooper, that North Carolina governor-elect, won is because he was on the ground in those communities and he was working hard. So, do Democrats have to re-examine how they approach things? Do progressives have to re-examine how they approach things? Absolutely. When I sat here and talked to Bernie Sanders, one of the things that he and I both agreed on was that we have to reinvigorate the DNC so that it is not viewed as a Washington entity but rather that it is a grassroots organization that is out all across the country and making a common cause with working people. What is your plan going to be going forward with this? You know, I am gonna sleep for a couple of weeks when I get out of here, take my wife on a well-deserved vacation. And I will spend time in my first year out of office writing a book, and I am gonna be organizing my presidential center, which is gonna be focused on precisely this issue of how do we train and empower the next generation of leadership. How do we rethink our storytelling, the messaging and the use of technology and digital media, so that we can make a persuasive case across the country? And not just in San Francisco or Manhattan but everywhere, about why climate change matters or why issues of economic inequality have to be addressed. So I will continue to be very active, and Michelle is going to continue to be very active--and the very thing that brought us here, which is our belief that when you work with people on the ground at a grassroots level, change happens. When people feel disconnected from the institutions of government, they can swing back and forth in all sorts of ways. Let me ask you about climate change. Trump says he is going to pull out of the Paris Agreements. Is that possible? Well, historically what happens is that when you have an international agreement, it carries over into the next administration. There were agreements that President Bush made that I respected, because as president of the United States, it was important for me to project a sense of continuity in the U.S. government. There is no doubt that the Republican Party has taken a very hard-line position with respect to climate change. And so some of the progress that we have made, it is going to be tempting for them to roll back. The good news is that a lot of these initiatives that we have taken work, and do not just work in terms of reducing emissions, they work from an economic perspective. And so over the course of my eight years, when we doubled clean-energy production or we cut in half, that was not just a matter of regulations that can suddenly be erased; that had to do with investors and businesses and utilities and consumers all organizing themselves, figuring out that, you know what, being smart on energy is good for the planet and it is good for my pocketbook. So I think that the question for Donald Trump, for the Republicans in Congress : Are they going to want to roll back hundreds of thousands of jobs in the solar industry that have been created? Are they suggesting that somehow the Big Three automakers retool to make more gas-guzzling cars, even though consumers are really happy saving money on gas? When it comes to power plants, contrary to the rhetoric, it has not been my regulations that killed coal. More than anything, it is actually been natural gas that is been a lot cheaper, so it has not been economical to build new coal mines. I understand all that, but you have nearly all of the science saying we are past the tipping point, and you have got the Koch brothers financing an absolutely obstructionist Congress. That is not going to change. Their ideology seems to be set on the subject. The money that is bought these votes is set on the subject. Yeah, listen. If you want to persuade me that everything is going to be terrible, then we can talk ourselves into that. Or we can act. It is what it is. There is been an election. There is going to be a Trump presidency, and Republicans are going to control Congress. And the question is gonna be, for those like you and I, who care about these issues, do we figure out how to continue to make progress in this environment until we have a chance for the next election. And will we have mobilized ourselves and persuaded enough people that we can get back on a path that we think is going to be helpful for families, helpful for the environment, helpful for our safety and security and rule of law and civil rights and social rights? And one of the things that I have been telling my younger staff, who in some cases have only known politics through my presidency, is history does not travel in a straight line. And it zigs and it zags and sometimes you take two steps forward and then you take a step back. You are absolutely right when it comes to us needing to feel an urgency about climate change, but what I have always said was, for us to get to where we need to go on climate, we got to have the American people public opinion on our side. They have got to feel a sense of urgency about it, and that requires us persuading and winning their votes so that we can implement these policies. And we have made significant progress relative to where we were eight years ago, nowhere near where we need to go. The Paris Agreement envisions us hitting targets a decade from now. I am confident that America can still hit those targets. And it may be that more of those targets are met on the back end because there are different policies coming out of the Trump administration on this. But I think that we can still achieve what needs to be achieved. There is no benefit that is derived from pulling into a fetal position. We go out there, and we work. And we slog through challenges, and over time things get better. Let me ask about immigration reform. Where do we go? What is the path forward on immigration? Well, look, there are those in the Republican Party who recognize that regardless of how this election played itself out, over time, alienating a big chunk of the Latino voters, the Asian voters, is gonna be a problem. And that gives some self-interest in solving this in a sensible way. It is going to be important for Democrats and immigration-rights activists to recognize that for the majority of the American people, borders mean something. And so there has to be, what I have said before, both rule of law and values that stay true to our immigrant roots. Those things do not have to be contradictory, but there have been times where in our big-heartedness around immigration, we have not adequately addressed how do we get the orderly and lawful part of it down. And we tend to dismiss people's concerns about making sure that immigration is lawful and orderly. And what that means, I think, is that there will still be an opportunity at some point to do comprehensive immigration reform. I do not think it is gonna happen over the next two years or maybe even not over the next four years, but what we can do is make smart changes, building on what we have already done around the legal immigration system. What we can do is to work along the borders in a cooperative way with Mexico so that the pressure of what are now mostly Central American immigrants into our country is handled in a humane way. And what we can do, and I will share this with President-elect Trump when I see him, is continue to make smart investments in countries like Honduras and El Salvador, and Guatemala that can help them deliver some sense of well-being for their people. You can now buy marijuana legally on the entire West Coast. So why are we still waging the War on Drugs? It is a colossal failure. Why are we still dancing around the subject and making marijuana equivalent to a Schedule I drug? Look, I have been very clear about my belief that we should try to discourage substance abuse. And I am not somebody who believes that legalization is a panacea. But I do believe that treating this as a public-health issue, the same way we do with cigarettes or alcohol, is the much smarter way to deal with it. Typically how these classifications are changed are not done by presidential edict but are done either legislatively or through the DEA. As you might imagine, the DEA, whose job it is historically to enforce drug laws, is not always going to be on the cutting edge about these issues. What about you? Are you gonna get on the cutting edge? Look, I am now very much in lame-duck status. And I will have the opportunity as a private citizen to describe where I think we need to go. But in light of these referenda passing, including in California, I have already said, and as I think I mentioned on Bill Maher's show, where he asked me about the same issue, that it is untenable over the long term for the Justice Department or the DEA to be enforcing a patchwork of laws, where something that is legal in one state could get you a 20-year prison sentence in another. So this is a debate that is now ripe, much in the same way that we ended up making progress on same-sex marriage. There is something to this whole states-being-laboratories-of-democracy and an evolutionary approach. You now have about a fifth of the country where this is legal. You got up there and said legalize same-sex marriage, and you pushed it right over the edge. Well, you know, no. I do not think that is how it works. If you will recall, what happened was, first, very systematically, I changed laws around hospital visitation for people who were same-sex partners. I then assigned the Pentagon to do a study on getting rid of do not ask, do not tell, which then got the buy-in of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we were then able to do not ask, do not tell. We then filed a brief on Proposition 8 out in California. And then, after a lot of groundwork was laid, then I took a position. So we are in the groundwork stage? One of the things that I think it is important for progressives to do when we are in a reflective mode after an election like this is, we cannot have it both ways. We cannot say, Why are not you reaching out to the folks who voted against us? And by the way, why are not you maximizing getting 100 percent for the things that those of us, you know, who are already progressive and living on the coasts think should be done right away? The point is that politics in a big, diverse country like this requires us to move the ball forward not in one long Hail Mary to the end zone, but to, you know, systemically make progress. So how do you think we go about stitching the country back together? Well, the most important thing that I am focused on is how we create a common set of facts. That sounds kind of abstract. Another way of saying it is, how do we create a common story about where we are. The biggest challenge that I think we have right now in terms of this divide is that the country receives information from completely different sources. And it is getting worse. The whole movement away from curated journalism to Facebook pages, in which an article on climate change by a Nobel Prize-winning scientist looks pretty much as credible as an article written by a guy in his underwear in a basement, or worse. Or something written by the Koch brothers. People are no longer talking to each other; they are just occupying their different spheres. And in an Internet era where we still value a free press and we do not want censorship of the Internet, that is a hard problem to solve. I think it is one that requires those who are controlling these media to think carefully about their responsibilities, and are ways to create a better conversation. It requires better civics education among our kids so that we can sort through what is true and what is not. It is gonna require those of us who are interested in progressive causes figuring out how do we attract more eyeballs and make it more interesting and more entertaining and more persuasive. Maybe the news business and the newspaper industry, which is being destroyed by Facebook, needs a subsidy so we can maintain a free press? The challenge is, the technology is moving so fast that it is less an issue of traditional media losing money. The New York Times is still making money. NPR is doing well. Yeah, it is a nonprofit, but it has a growing audience. The problem is segmentation. We were talking about the issue of a divided country. Good journalism continues to this day. There is great work done in Rolling Stone. The challenge is people are getting a hundred different visions of the world from a hundred different outlets or a thousand different outlets, and that is ramping up divisions. It is making people exaggerate or say what is most controversial or peddling in the most vicious of insults or lies, because that attracts eyeballs. And if we are gonna solve that, it is not going to be simply an issue of subsidizing or propping up traditional media; it is going to be figuring out how do we organize in a virtual world the same way we organize in the physical world. We have to come up with new models. What kind of private moments have you had that define your last eight years? Oh, well, you know there have been well-known moments like me walking across the colonnade and hearing the chants of USA after we had gotten bin Laden, or being up on the Truman Balcony with my young staff after we got the Affordable Care Act passed. There have been times just sitting in the Treaty Room reading letters from people who have a story to tell, a veteran who is not getting services they need a young DREAM Act kid who describes how he is now gotten a degree and has gone back and is teaching in the school where he went, that move you deeply. But I think the thing that I will miss the most about this place, the thing that can get me sentimental--and I try not to get too nostalgic, because I still got a bunch of work to do it is the team we built here. The number of young people in this place who are just amazing. Somebody like a Brian Deese. Nobody outside of the White House necessarily knows Brian, must be 35, 37, something like that. He is our deputy chief of staff for policy. He engineered the Paris Agreement, the Agreement, the Aviation Agreement, may have helped save the planet, and he is just doing it while he is got two babies at home, and could not be a better person. And there are people like him across this administration. What I will take away from this experience is them: seeing how they work together, seeing the commitments they have made toward the issues that we care about. Do you think Michelle should run for office? Michelle will never run for office. She is as talented a person as I know. You can see the incredible resonance she has with the American people. But I joke that she is too sensible to want to be in politics. What advice do you have for Trump? Well, I will have a chance to talk to him tomorrow, and I think the main thing that I will say to him is, number one, however you campaigned, once you are in this office, you are part of a legacy dating back to those first Revolutionaries. And this amazing experiment in democracy has to be tended. So aside from any particular issue, the president needs to recognize that this is not about you. This is not about your power, your position or the perks, the Marine band. This is about this precious thing that we have inherited and that we want to pass on. And for me at least, that means you surround yourself with really good people, that you spend time learning and understanding what these issues are because they really actually have an impact on people. They are not games that we are playing. And that to the best of your ability, you are making the decisions that you think are right for the American people --even when they are not popular, even when they are not expedient. And the satisfaction you get from that is that when you leave this place, you can feel like you have been true to this immense privilege and responsibility that is been given to you. Do you think the weight of history will constrain him to some extent? I think sitting behind that desk is sobering, and that it will have an impact on him as it has on every president. But I think the most important constraint on any president is the American people themselves, of an informed citizenry that is active and participating and engaged. And that is going to be something that I will, in my own modest ways, continue to try to encourage for the rest of my life.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjannwennerrollingstone", "title": "Interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jann-wenner-rolling-stone", "publication_date": "09-11-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 487, "text": "First of all, we would like to thank you very much for your readiness to see us and to have this interview for us. We can assure you that in Israel, you can be elected for the third term with one exception: The day after the first day in office, the media will kill you. This is Israel. But you have so many, really, admirers in Israel. Well, thank you. I am really looking forward to going again. As you know, this is my first trip as ENTITY. I had the honor I saw you. I had the opportunity to shake your hand in the Knesset. I was thrilled to go in 1998. One of the great ironies of my first trip to Israel was that, as well documented, I was given a tour of the West Bank by Ariel Sharon. Little did we both realize then that we would be sitting together in the hopes of constructing peace, that we knew we'd be we did not know that we'd be ENTITY and Prime Minister at the time. And yet he was the leader of the opposition at the time. Well, he was in the Cabinet. He was a settlements man. And we were flying, and it was a very interesting moment. And I can remember so well Prime Minister Sharon pointing to a hill, and he said, This is where I engaged as a young tank officer, my first battle, and see how far it is to our capital and our civilization. In other words, it was his purpose was to make it clear to me the strategic issues facing Israel. And then we flew over the West Bank, and it was a fascinating moment. And it was history works in odd ways, and sometimes you are never sure about the twists and turns that life will bring. And so I am looking forward to meeting with the Sharon family and express my admiration for a man with whom I was able to Two years from today he had his stroke. Yes, 2 years to this day. Today, today. Anyway, it will be an interesting moment for me, to express my sympathies to his family. He was an interesting man, and anyway, I am looking forward to going to see the current leadership in Israel as well as the Palestinians and the Arab region. 's Upcoming Visit to Israel Could we ask could we start asking questions? Please, yes. Your visit to Israel, what is the vision you would like to convey to the Israeli public? The vision is, one, that I fully understand that the world is confronting extremists the world must confront extremists who want to impose their ideology on peaceful people by the use of terror; and that we are engaged in an ideological struggle that requires resolve and vision; and that the best way to defeat the ideology of hate is with an ideology of hope, and that is manifested in a society based upon liberty; that the two-state solution is in Israel's long-term security interests, and that there is hard work to be done by the leaders of the Palestinians and the Israelis. I will also assure Israel that there is no way that a Israeli democracy can accept a terrorist state on her border; that there is a way and I am optimistic that there are enough Palestinians committed to a state based upon liberty that we can achieve that they can achieve, with U.S. help, the vision of two states side by side in peace. Mr. ENTITY. , the Israeli people are worried, first and foremost, because of the danger that Iran will acquire nuclear weapons. Can you, Mr. ENTITY. , assure the Israelis that such a danger will never occur under your watch? Well, I can assure the people of Israel and others in the Middle East that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be a danger to world peace. I have said so very explicitly. I believe that the and I believe we have put in place a system that encourages pressure on the Iranians to come up with to either have a choice between isolation and financial difficulty or a rational approach to what they claim is their sovereign right, which is the ability to have nuclear power. Now, they have been untrustworthy; they have been unwilling to be transparent and open. And so our demands are to the Iranians, not only with our voice, but the voice of the international community thus far, is, you must be transparent; you must be open; and you because of your failure to report programs, that you cannot be trusted with the ability to learn how to enrich. And so my message to the Israeli people is, I fully understand the threat, that we spend a lot of time on this issue, and that we will continue to exert maximum pressure through the international community to peacefully resolve this issue. I am sure you have heard the report by the American intelligence Yes, I have. Unfortunately for us, we followed it too. How it affected the chances to stop Iran from becoming a danger? Actually, if you study the report carefully, it basically said not basically it said that Iran had a secret program In the year 2003. Right. But my message to the American people was is that a nontransparent society that had a program could easily have another program. And therefore, the intensity of the effort must not decline, but must stay strong and the intensity of the effort being to prevent them from developing the know-how. Secondly, there are three stages to the development of a nuclear weapon: one, materials out of which to make a weapon that is why we have got to stop them from enriching, and that is where our focus is; two, the ability to take materials and to make it into a warhead or a bomb and we do not know their capacities at this point in time, but it is fairly general knowledge on how to produce a weapon out of materials; and three, rockets. Well, two of the three continue to exist. And therefore, to say a weapons program does not exist is not the complete truth. And so our focus is to prevent the one thing over which we believe the international community can have influence, which is to stop the capacity to enrich. Thirdly, the report did say that as a result of pressures, the Iranians suspended their military program. Well, if pressures worked in the past, my hope is that pressures will work in the future. Part of the reason I am going to the Middle East is to make it abundantly clear to nations in that part of the world that we view Iran as a threat, and that the NIE in no way lessens that threat, but in fact, clarifies the threat. If Israel comes with a smoking gun during the year 2008, are you going to back an Israeli operation military operation? My message to all in the region is, I believe we can solve this diplomatically and that pressure must work. I have said, of course, that the United States keeps all options on the table. That is the United States policy. And that but I believe the best solution is going to be one that encourages Iranian isolation through international pressures that will cause the Iranians to have to make a strategic choice. Now, people say: Well, what do you mean by that? What kind of pressures? Well, there are financial pressures that we have exerted and will continue to work with others to exert. Now, look, I readily recognize that one of the real challenges is to convince people that peace is more important than market share, that achieving long-term peace in the Middle East is more important than someone's companies having a share of equipment American or Well, I am saying any company. Of course, American companies are not involved with the exportation of goods and services to Iran. Therefore, in this case, I mean, the logic would say that extends to not only European countries but countries from around the world. Same with financial institutions, that we expect there to be significant pressure placed upon Iranian financial institutions, particularly those that are known to be involved in proliferation. And so the strategy is more than just words; it is an action-oriented strategy, aimed at convincing people inside of Iran that there is a better way forward. If you look at my speeches or listen to my speeches, you will notice that I constantly speak to the Iranian people and make it clear to them that the isolation that they are now suffering and the economic deprivation that is occurring as a result of isolation is a result of their Government's decisions. Our beef is not with the Iranian people, our beef is with a Government that has hidden the program. And by the way, back to the NIE very quickly. The international response ought to be that, okay, whether or not you agree with the NIE or not, at least recognize that they had a program at one point in time, and demand that Iran explain it. We should not be trying to explain why we know what we know. We ought to be focusing on the Iranians to say, you tell us why you had a program; you tell us about the if you want to be an international player, it is up to you to explain. Mr. ENTITY. , I will try to put the question another way. If the Israeli Prime Minister will present you with a smoking gun and will tell you, look, we cannot live with such a threat, and we will destroy the Iranian nuclear sites, you will support Israel? You will give Israel you will let Israel to do so? The policy of the United States is to solve this diplomatically. You know, Israel is Israeli people are confused regarding our own Government. There is now a big discussion in Israel regarding the blunders of the second Lebanon war. And at the same time, you are familiar with the September 6th whatever happens there, we do not know; I am sure you know. Can you tell us what is your impression of the, I would say, of the way the Israeli Government is handling our own military? I can only tell you about my personal relationship with Prime Minister Olmert. That is the person with whom I have spent the most time. I, of course, see the Foreign Minister or the Defense Minister at meetings, but my time is spent with Prime Minister Olmert. I trust him, I like him, and I think he is a man of strength. Prime Minister Olmert, first of all, one thing I look for is, I look for vision. Can somebody see a hopeful future? A lot of times in the this complicated world in which we live, we stay so focused on the moment that it is hard to see a vision that reaches beyond the immediate. And so when I talk to Prime Minister Olmert, I listen very carefully about his vision for the future because what we are talking about at Annapolis is vision, is giving people something to be for, something to hope for. The whole purpose of our discussions at Annapolis has been to advance what a state would look like. The state is subject to the roadmap, the obligations of both sides before the state can come into being; it is subject to the roadmap. But there is got to be a vision because a vision is inspirational, a vision is hopeful. There is got to be something that the Palestinians can say, if Here is what we are for. Therefore, let us renounce our desire to destroy Israel; let us recognize that it must exist as a neighbor. So support us. I believe there is enough people in the Palestinian Territories who are sick of the failures of the past, sick of broken promise. And yet they have yet to have something specifically defined around which they can rally. That is the purpose. And so when I talk to Prime Minister Olmert, I listen very carefully to whether or not he is able to think beyond the moment. And I have come to the conclusion that, yes, he is a man of vision. He understands the significance of defining a hopeful state. And it is hopeful not just for the Palestinians, but it is hopeful for Israel as well. After all, he ran on a platform that said now, this is a major shift in Israeli policy; it started with Ariel Sharon, as you know which is two states, based upon the premise that liberty will bring peace. Now, of course, his concern is that the imposition of a state before certain conditions have been met that is why I say, subject to the roadmap. And the United States, as I said early, recognizes that there cannot be a state that harbors the desire to destroy its neighbor. No government can accept that, and I understand that. And so I trust Olmert. His Do you? I do trust him. You trust Olmert, period? I trust him. I hope hopefully, he will say the same about me. Hopefully you see, one of the things in politics that happens often is, people sometimes will not tell you really what is on their mind. It happens here in America. For example, you will have politicians walk in the Oval Office and say, Hey, ENTITY. , I am with you. And then all of a sudden, the heat gets on and it turns out, they are not with you. You feel it at your back. Yes. Well, I feel and I have had enough conversations, heart-to-heart conversations with the Prime Minister. I understand Israeli politics is very complicated. It is tough. It is full-contact karate. And Not unlike American Not really. Not really. Because the ENTITY. is even though we have got our politics and even though I have got tough relations at times with Congress, the ENTITY. sets foreign policy. He is constantly worried about a coalition. And I understand that. I understand the difficulty he faces. But in spite of those difficulties, I am interested in strategic visions based upon peace. And I firmly believe he has that vision. And obviously, he is going to have to work his way through the Israeli politics, and he is going to have to be mindful of what is happening elsewhere. And the United States, by the way, can help both parties. That is why I am going, to help boost the confidence of both parties to reach out for a vision. And by the way, the trip is more than just going to Israel and the Palestinian Territories. I am also going to the Arab world for two reasons. One is to convince the Arab nations that Israel is a partner should be a partner in peace; that this vision is in the interests not only of Israel and Palestinians, but it is in the interests of the Arab world. You expect to achieve something tangible? Well, we achieved something very tangible. Look, you got to understand that in a matter as complicated as this issue, that it requires a lot of diligence and a lot of time and a lot of effort. There was a major breakthrough at Annapolis when the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian ENTITY. addressed a roomful of diplomats, high-ranking officials from the Middle East, as well as the rest of the world. And so now we must follow up on that success. In other words, they were in the room listening very carefully to the visions of both nations. And the American ENTITY. can help move the process forward by reminding friends and allies in the Middle East about the importance of the two-state solution and what they can do to help. And the third thing, of course, is to spend time talking about the strategic implications of a U.S. presence in a way that bolsters governments and, at the same time, helps serve as a bulwark against aggressive regimes such as Iran. And so it is a multifaceted agenda that I am really looking forward to carrying on there in the Middle East. But still, Mr. ENTITY. , do you see a chance to sign a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Yes, I do, before I leave. Before you leave? Yes, I do. I do. I am an optimistic guy. by initials or by full execution? Well, first of all no. First of all, the I envision Israel and Palestine sitting down at a table, signing this is what a state would look like, subject to the roadmap. There is work to be done. And concluding an agreement? On what the state would look like, absolutely. Yes, I do. I think it can happen. And I believe both parties want it to happen. Now, they got work to do, and one of the reasons I am going is to remind them of the work they got to do. See, people say to me, All you got to do is go over there and say impose the solution. No, we want the solution to last. This has got to be negotiated in good faith, and it is hard work. Both leaders have got constituencies they have got to deal with, skeptical publics. And I believe the U.S. ENTITY. can help keep the process moving, and that is what my trip is all about. Unauthorized settlement, it is something which an issue which is between the United States and Israel for a long time. Yes, we expect them to honor their commitments. The Israeli Government has said that they are going to get rid of unauthorized settlements, and that is what we expect. That is what we have been told. Not before you come, you know. Well, that will be on the that will, of course, be an agenda item. But Prime Minister both Prime Ministers with whom I have worked understand our position. Both have agreed, by the way, of unauthorized settlements. They agree? Both understand, as well, that I said conditions on the ground, the realities of the situation will help determine what a the borders look like. And so I have made some at least from what the U.S. perspective looks like some statements that will help move the process forward. But the unauthorized settlements, which is different from authorized settlements, is an issue we have been very clear on. But I have also made statements on the settlements as well. As I said, realities on the ground will help define the border the eventual border of what the Palestinian state will look like. And the state will come into being subject to the conditions set out in the roadmap, which means we have got a lot of work to do. One of the things I will be doing is visiting with Tony Blair there in order to make to catch up on what he is doing to help the Palestinians. Look, developing a state out of is difficult. There is got to be institutions that provide stability, and it is hard to do. That is what happening in IraIt is hard to go from dictatorship, like they had in Iraq, to one in which there is solid institutions that will enable a democracy to survive. I have come to the conclusion that it is absolutely necessary work for the sake of peace because if we are in an ideological struggle, the only way to defeat the ideology that preys upon fear and hate is through the development of societies that respond to the will of the people. And democracies it turns out, democracies throughout our history tend not to fight each other because democracies respond to the will of the people, and most people do not want war and bloodshed and violence. Most people just want to live a normal, peaceful life. I tell the American people all the time that Iraqi mothers want the same thing for their children that American mothers want for theirs, a place for their child to grow up and get a good education and be able to realize dreams. Same thing for the Palestinian mothers and the Israeli mothers. There is a commonality there, and yet, unfortunately, in the world in which we live today, there are people who simply do not like the idea of societies based upon the will of the people and will use violence to stop the advance of freedom. And it is not just in the Palestinian Territories that you find the violence, you find it in Lebanon, you find it in Iraq, you find it in Afghanistan, you find it in Pakistan. You find it in Gaza. Yes. You find people who will kill innocent life to stop the advance of freedom, which should call the world to should cause the world to rally. If killers want to stop liberty, it should be a clear signal to all of us that we must do everything we can to advance liberty. And one of the things I find very hopeful about a Palestinian state is that many in the world want to help the Palestinians develop institutions and stability. And I ENTITY. Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are committed to the development of a state. They need a lot of help. And one of the things we can provide help for besides some practical help on organizing their security forces and obviously to encourage investment is to there is got to be a vision, see. People have got to be for something. And that is where we are trying to take the process over the next year. Mr. ENTITY. , you just mentioned IraCan you clarify to us whether there was any Israeli involvement in your decision to invade Iraq? No, not at all, none whatsoever. My decision was based upon U.S. intelligence, based upon the desire to provide security for our peoples and others. It was based upon my willingness to work with the international community on this issue. Remember, if you look back at the history, there was a unanimous vote in the Security Council: disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. And when he defied, when he refused to allow the inspectors in, when he made a statement by his actions that he did not really care what the international community said, that I decided to make sure words meant something. And so I acted based upon our own security interests. And but it also fit into this notion of and remember, Zarqawi there was some terrorist connections, not with the 9/11 attacks, but terrorist connections. Abu Nidal, he had been using he'd been funding families of suicide bombers. In other words, as far as we were concerned, he had weapons of mass destruction, which could have been used in a deadly way. It turns out, he did not have the weapons, but he had the know-how on how to make weapons, which could easily have been reconstituted. The sanctions regime turns out to have been corrupt and was not working. In other words, there is a variety of aspects to my decision, all of which were aimed at making sure that U.S. security, first and foremost, was enhanced. National Security Council Press Secretary Gordon Johndroe. One last question. You follow the primaries now, in America. Yes. We wonder if there is a moment when you tell yourself, wow, why cannot I join the fray? That is interesting. I can do it better. No, no, I appreciate that question. It is a very interesting question. I believe strongly that democracies are enhanced by change by the peaceful change of government. And as much as I will miss being ENTITY. and there will be a lot of aspects I will miss about it it is in our Nation's interests that there be a healthy debate and that the process move on. And so I am realistic about what is going to happen this year. You know, I loved campaigning. We were reminiscing at the ranch this weekend Laura and I and some friends were about how exciting ENTITY. ial campaigns can be. And I also understand how grueling they can be. This is a time of high anxiety for campaigns and candidates as they come in the final day of the Iowa caucuses. I can remember distinctly what it felt like campaigning in these States In the snow. in the snow on the last day. And so there is a lot of excitement to it. But I am very comfortable about this year. We have got a lot to do. We have got a lot to do domestically and a lot to do internationally. I fully understand there is going to be a lot of focus on the ENTITY. ial primaries and the ENTITY. ial general election, which is good. There ought to be a healthy debate. In the meantime, however, I am not going to allow domestic politics to get in the way of implementing a vision, of doing laying that foundation for peace, one of the things history will look back on. When you are talking about vision, Mr. ENTITY. and this will be our last question how do you wish to be remembered in world history? Well, first of all, I will be dead before the true history of the Bush administration is written. Here in the Oval Office, there are portraits of two ENTITY. s, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. In the past couple of years, I have read extensive analyses of both of those men's Presidencies. My attitude is that it is going to take a while for objective historians to realize the contributions that this administration has made to peace. Like Harry Truman's legacy, which developed. Well, each ENTITY. has his own set of circumstances with which to deal. I would hope that people, when they look back at this administration, would say that ENTITY. Bush and his administration worked diligently to protect the American people from harm; that he recognized the threats of the 21st century; that he acted in a when he needed to be tough, he acted strong, and when he needed to have vision, he understood the power of freedom to be transformative. Our foreign policy is more than just confronting terrorists. Our foreign policy is to confront the conditions that enable these ideologues to recruit, such as HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa or feeding the hungry or dealing with malaria. Our foreign policy is based upon our great trust in the capacity of the common person to dictate a peaceful course for government. But just so you know, I fully understand I will be long gone before the accurate history of this administration is reflected in the history books. In our country, you will not have to wait so long. Well, I do not worry about it, sir. I just really do not . It is such an honor to be You betray the office if you get so caught up in your own per-sonal your personal standing. I remind people that the ENTITY. should must understand, like in the Middle East, that the conditions must be ripe for people to go for peace and that you cannot force peace based upon a ENTITY. 's calendar. You can use the calendar by saying to the parties, you know this guy, you know his vision; now is the time for you to come to conclusion. But a ENTITY. must never try to force others to accept something that they themselves do not want to accept because there will be it will not last. Now, we can work hard, and I believe the time is ripe; that is what I am trying to say to you. We have got leaders who have made commitments to a vision. They have both told me and told each other, we are committed. And these men know me. And so I believe to answer your question yes, there will be a comprehensive peace signed by the end of this year, because if they are committed, like they say they are and I believe they are, and I believe their people, the majority of the people want there to be peace now is the time to move.

{"id": 131, "text": "ENTITY Yes, sir. You are by now an experienced European traveler, so I would like to ask you, is there something wrong with the U.S.-European relationship in terms of a growing psychological, military, technological gap? Is there something that is worrying you and that you hear from your friends that is worrying them? Well, first, I recognize that there are more ties that bind us than do not . You see, when you love freedom, that is a powerful tie. The German people, the French, Russians, and the Italians, like Americans, love freedom. And so do I, a lot. And that is what binds us. We have got values that bind us: rule of law, constitutions, marketplace, the rule of the marketplace. These are common values that make us bound together. We have got common problems that we must solve that are also greater than any dispute that may arise. I mean, listen, fighting for terror is a common cause that is a powerful force that unites us. So I think the relationship is a strong relationship, and it is a healthy relationship. And of course there are disagreements at times. We have trade disagreements, but that is because we have got a lot of trade; we have got $2 trillion of trade a year. If we did not have any trade, there would be no disagreements. But that is normal; that is in the normal course of business. And I certainly do not let that affect my way of how I view this incredibly important alliance and relationships. So I am -I go to Europe feeling optimistic about our relationships and feeling optimistic about our capacities to work together to solve problems. ENTITY, some American political scientists would prefer to see Russia in the future as undeveloped. Yes. As a strong developer Pay attention to him. they became a significant competitor for the U.S.A. However, a poor and a bitter country would be even more dangerous. Yes. How do you, ENTITY, see Russia in the near future? Well, first of all, it is the same issue that relates to the European Union and America as well as Russia and America. We want healthy competition. We want our friends to be strong and competitive. We want the economies to grow. I think it is essential for American policy-makers to recognize that a healthy Europe and a healthy Russia is in our Nation's interests. It makes it easier; for example, a healthy economy makes it more likely that a friendship will develop in a more significant way. And so my message to the Russian people, as well as to here at home, is that it is important that Russia be viewed as a friend, not as an enemy. I said that right off the bat; that was my stated goal as a ENTITY, is to work with Russia as a friend, not as an enemy. I was able in Slovenia to realize that was possible when I visited with . And this head of his bureau there, or whatever you want to call the guy, asked me the question, first question: Do you trust Putin? Yes. I answered that several months ago when-what is the boy's name? Fournier is his name please, scratch that from the notes. They said, How do you know? I said, I looked into his eyes and was able to glimpse into his soul. See, and I have been proven right. I do trust him because I believe he cares deeply about moving forward. There is so much that can be done in the spirit of friendship, together. And that is how I view-that is -and we have got a lot of problems. We have got AIDS ravishing an entire continent. Well, imagine, here we are, we are all representative of relatively wealthy nations-hopefully, Russia's wealth will increase-and yet, we are confronted with a society that is being wiped out. And so one of the fundamental questions is how-what do we do? We have got nations, responsible nations-how do we respond to that? And I have got some ideas. As you know, we put a-anyway, my point to you is that we want Russia to succeed. We want Russia to be healthy. We want Russia, our partner now in fighting terrorism, to have the means to continue the fight. And I hope this trip will help, you know, assuage the doubts of some in Russia who-and in America-who like the old way of resentment and bitterness and hatred. Vladimir Putin and I are putting that behind us for the good of both peoples. ENTITY, one of the main vehicles of the relationship between the U.S. and Europe is, of course, NATO. Yes. And we have many in Europe, and not only Europe, are wondering, is NATO doomed? Will it disappear at some point? And if not, what is the purpose of NATO in the coming years? Well, that is a great question. NATO is more needed than ever in many ways. And let me explain it to you this way. The nature of the threats to us- and I say us collectively-has changed. And what we are learning is, it is the ability for nations to share information and to cut off finances, the ability for nations to deny safe haven, the ability for nations to keep these killers on the run that is going to make this war successful. And therefore, it is a collective effort in order to beat a terrorist network. And NATO is a collection of freedom-loving countries. Therefore, NATO must change its mission-not its mission, its focus and its capabilities in order to meet the threats that now face us. So I think NATO is very relevant. That is why in Prague, next fall, I will-depending upon the actions of applicant states- will follow through my speech I gave in Warsaw and will reiterate somewhat in Germany, that I see a Europe whole, free, at peace with itself. And NATO expansion is one way to achieve that. Now, I caution those who would read your articles to not take anything for granted when it comes to the NATO expansion. But I have been on record as one that has talked aggressively about expansion. The reason I do is because I understand the importance of NATO and the relevance of NATO. And we need to work within NATO to make sure that NATO has got the capacities to-to better use capabilities, define capabilities and strategies, make sure an expanded NATO is flawless and seamless in its capacity to advance against a new threat. So I think it is a very relevant part of the future, and I will say that in Germany, and to Jacques. If I may have a followup on this-- Sure. Are you worried by the gap in military capabilities, which is widening-and even, with your budget, will be widening more- between Europe and the U.S.? I think that is an issue. I do think it is an issue. On the other hand, it is an issue that can be overcome with time. We are transforming our military or trying to transform our military rapidly. There is a few weapons systems that seem to keep popping up, even though they may have been doomed at one point. But that is part of the process. And-but we are transforming. And NATO must transform as well in order to meet the true threats. Russia is not a threat. Russia is not a threat to the West. And therefore, NATO must align its capabilities and its budgets to the new threat. And that is going to take awhile. I understand that. So I am not in a-you know, I am optimistic about NATO changing. I have talked to Lord Robertson about this issue. I will address it in my speech in Germany as well, about how to make sure NATO stays relevant as we head into the 21st century. But gaps can be closed, and gaps can be changed, particularly technological gaps, particularly among friends. And I will repeat, I go to Europe as a friend, and someone with whom-someone who wants to work with Europe to achieve common objectives. And I will say this again: The war on terror requires significant cooperation. We are not fighting a nation that has got the capacity to move tanks. We are fighting a group of killers, international killers who hide in caves, who burrow in free societies, who are patient and tough and mean, and who want to destroy. And therefore, we must cooperate with each other; we must share intelligence; we must run down leads; we must interdict; we must arrest. And a great place to start is with a collection of freedom-loving countries, and that is NATO. What is the Russia-NATO Council about? Does it give a say to Russia on NATO issues? And if not, what? The at 20 certainly does not give Russia any veto power over military actions. And that is important to know. However, it recognizes that Russia can be an important partner in a peaceful Europe by working, initially working with Russia on counterproliferation measures, terrorism measures, ways to address the new threats facing all of us. Russia faces the same threat that Italy, France, Germany, and America faces, and that is the threat of terrorism. It is important for your readers to know you face the threat, just like we face the threat. It may not seem so-it may not seem so. But I am telling you the threat is real. understands that. Therefore, it makes-as do Europe leaders as well, I want you to know. And it, therefore, makes eminent sense to include Russia in a new relationship with NATO, and that is what we are going to confirm on the outskirts of Rome. ENTITY, would you say that Iraq, for the time being, is basically contained? Or do you think that there are urgent steps required to undertake against Saddam's plans with weapons of mass destruction? Sure. I am a patient man. And I am a deliberate man. But the word contain does not work if someone's got the capacity to deliver a weapon of mass destruction. How can you contain somebody when they have got the ability to blackmail or launch a weapon? And that is my deep concern. And I feel passionate about this concern, because I know the nature of the regime. And I know the potential threat that could come if this terrorist organization that we are hunting down teams up with-I am not sure how you translate into German, but-- We will find a way. --coordinate, allies with, coordinates with-uses these weapons of mass destruction to further their means as well. And I am concerned about it. I know there is a lot of angst about my statements about these nations, but I have the responsibility to speak as clearly as I possibly can about how I view the nature of these regimes. And I will continue doing that. Is that why the said that inspections are not really enough? Well, we certainly hope that the Iraq Government will allow there to be full and open and unfettered inspections. We want to know. This is a man who is denied inspections for years. I wonder why. I think the world ought to ask, why will not you allow for inspections? Every time they talk about inspections, he is got a certain kind of caveats and strings, and will not let them- You cannot go here. You cannot go there. So I think the was expressing some skepticism about the nature of the regime itself. And we'd like to see inspections, unfettered, whole, free inspections. We'd like these inspectors to go look where they want to look, just like Saddam Hussein agreed to do over a decade ago. ENTITY, can you please describe your relationship-I am excited, therefore I am reading. Can you please describe your relationship with ? Yes. How do you call each other during the informal session? What are the subjects of your conversation after official state session? Well, I would call my relationship warm. I enjoy his company. He has got a good sense of humor, and I appreciate that. And he has kindly invited me to his house, and I am looking forward to going. Our conversations will be about-here is a man who loves Russia, and he loves the Russian people. And he is deeply concerned about problems facing Russia. And a lot of times, even in the most informal gathering, he shares with me his deep concerns. He is a-he also is a man who worries about the threats that Russia faces. We share a common interest in this war on terror because Russia, herself, has been attacked; innocent people have lost life. And he is passionate on the subject, about protecting his homeland. And we share information about how best to do that. I mean, we ask questions as friends would ask questions: How are you doing this? Where are you doing that? How do you call him? Vladimir? Oh, I call him Vladimir, yes. Vladimir? Yes. And he calls me George. But he is a-one of the interesting things we are going to do is go to St. Petersburg together and go on the barges and see the White Nights. Do you know a couple of words in Russian? No. No? Nyet. One. But I have got a Russian speaker with me, Senorita Arroz. Arroz means Rice. ENTITY, the warnings which have been issued in the last days about terrorist threat, including what the said on Sunday-is it a kind of general notice to the American people that they must stay vigilant in the demands on the U.S. front? Or does it point out to any specific and imminent threat? The FBI Director yesterday, I talked to him-he comes in every morning, by the way. So this subject-he came up this morning. He was talking about-he was speculating based upon a lot of intelligence that indicates that the Al Qaida is active, plotting, planning, you know, trying to hit us. So he was speculating. He basically said, Look, I would not be surprised if there is another attack, and it is going to be difficult to stop them, is what he said. The also reflected that attitude. Now, if and when we have a specific threat, you know, we-in other words, if I were to tell you that I know that there is a-thinking about an attack on a certain moment at a certain place, we would deal with that in a way that would obviously harden that site. We would put our assets in place to prevent that from happening. I doubt there'd be a lot of publicity. The people, obviously, whose lives could be affected would be informed, directly informed, as the country, as the Government deployed assets to react. These are very clever killers. And I refer to them as killers because that is what they are. They are out to kill, no other way to put it. And they-their communications are adept. And we are learning more about them. But they are -they are a heck of a lot more sophisticated than people assume, I guess is the best way to put it. They think, and they plan, and they plot. They burrow into free societies. And so what the and the FBI Director were reflecting was a general understanding of the desires and attitudes and methodology or potential methodology-obviously, if we knew the exact methodology, they would not be around; we would have taken care of-well, protect our homeland, I will put it to you that way, within the Constitution of the United States, of course. They would be off the streets. It is a concern. This is-I mean, every morning I read threats-some, by the way, directed not toward U.S. assets, but to the assets of our friends. As a matter of fact, I am confident that I have read threats that were directed to the countries represented here. All the time, we share information immediately. As a matter of fact, before I see it, I am confident that the information has gone to the intelligence-gathering networks of the respected countries. And that is very important; that is very important. I do not mean to be an alarmist. And again, there are no-I did not have a-there is not a moment. But there is an attitude of these people. And they are relentless, they just are. And therefore, when you hear me say that the best strategy, the best defense is an offense, I mean it. And the best way to protect our respective people is to hunt these people down. One of my jobs is to continually educate the American people and, for that matter, anybody who is interested in the world who wants to listen, as to the true nature of what we face. I have got a better handle on it than most. I pay attention to it every day. My most important job-we will debate all the debates and all the issues, but my most important job is to protect America and our friends and allies and work with our friends and allies to protect the innocent people in your countries. You know, it is a unique war we are fighting. The old wars, there would be battle-lines and movements, and you could measure progress here and territory taken here. A lot of people steeped in history kind of still think that way. But it is a different kind of war. And we are recognizing how different it is as we get more intelligence. And it takes a different effort to fight it. But it is real; it is absolutely real. I know some in the world do not particularly want to hear that. It is much easier not to be confronted with the truth, because it means that there is going to be sacrifice and worry and concern. But it is a real threat, and I am going to-I will battle with all my-and I have got a great country behind me doing-- On this point, were you disappointed by the questions raised by the Democrats about the way you were informed? Did the conclusions you draw, you drew from this information-- As I said, this is the- the thing about Washington. I suspect capitals elsewhere-democracy, there is nothing like a little second-guessing. As I said, in Washington, the second-guessing is second nature. I am used to it. I think there was a lot of-most of the elected officials here are very responsible citizens. They understand the nature of the intelligence; they understand how it works. We are a united country-may flare up a little, politics flares up. But we are a united country. And this country is-both Republicans and Democrats are united to win this war on terror, and I appreciate that spirit from Washington. On Middle East-- Make it a good one. Yes. Be sure it is a good one. I am sure everybody here is interested in that subject. Is peace possible with ? It is a very interesting question. First of all, I meant what I said on April the 4th, when I said Mr. has let the Palestinian people down. He is had a chance to lead. He had a chance to get a peace agreement with my predecessor. He is had chance after chance. And by failing to lead, he has really let the Palestinians down. I say that with a lot of angst in my heart because I am concerned about the plight of the Palestinian citizenry, poor and isolated and frustrated. Many live in refugee camps and have for years. And there is obviously-I realize in many of their hearts, there is little hope, and that is frustrating. And so I am clearly disappointed. Somebody said, Has he earned your respect? I said, he never had my respect, because he has-he let his people down. The role of a leader is to lead. Having said that, I do think peace is possible, and I think it is important. I think it is very important that we work toward a vision of two states living side by side in peace. There is work for all of us involved in this process, to have that vision so necessary for a secure Israel and so necessary for a hopeful Palestine. The process to get there is going to require a commitment by all parties: a commitment for the United States to continue to lead on the issue, and we will; a commitment by the Israelis to make the tough choices necessary for the Palestinian state to exist; the commitment by the Palestinians to renounce and fight terror; the commitment by the Arab world to become engaged not only in the humanitarian aspects of the region but to be a part of the building of the institutions necessary for a Palestinian state to exist. That starts with a security apparatus that actually functions for the benefit of the Palestinian people by fighting off terror, by rejecting extremism. There is-and at the same time, shows the world, not only just Israel but shows American and Arab nations and everybody, the EU, that there is a concerted effort to fight terror, a security force in which authority and responsibility are properly aligned. That is step one. A while ago I announced that Tenet was going to reengage in the process of developing this security force. There also needs to be the institutions necessary for the growth of a state, such as the ability to disburse money in a noncorrupt way, the capacity to provide help for citizens-actual help for citizens who suffer-in a way that will lead to the rebuilding of community; they have the civil institutions necessary for growth. That will come when there are- when there is the reforms necessary to make sure there is accountability in the Palestinian Authority. There needs to be the conditions necessary for economic vitality; that is trade. There is money willing to be spent. The EU-I have talked to on the subject; I have talked to your respective leaders on the subject. I have committed to it. But I am not committed to spending- sending money in a place until I am convinced it is going to be spent to help the Palestinian people. And so I-yes, I think peace is possible. It is going to take awhile; it is going to take a lot of work. And the first steps necessary are for people to assume their responsibilities, to assume a responsible role. I am-I will tell you that you have read the press accounting of what is taking place. There is a sense that-amongst some in the region, a lot in the region, that there needs to be a reform process in the Palestinians that will boost the confidence of, first, the people, second, the neighborhood, and third, the community of the world, of which the EU and America are an integral part. So I will continue to work for peace, and I just-to renounce terror, insist that people fight off terrorist attacks, demand that there be accountability for people who are involved in the process, cut off money wherever we can, to deny terrorists the capacity to derail peace by death. And we have to do that in order to achieve peace. You have got to deny people-killers the ability to destroy hope through death. And I am optimistic we can do that. I believe we can.

{"id": 128, "text": "So here is what we are going to do. I will say a few comments, and we will kind of do the loop until we run out of time. First, I am really looking forward to this trip. I think it is going to be historic. You will ask me who I am voting for, for expansion; I am not going to tell you. You will find out on Thursday. I say that because that is what we have all agreed to. But if you are interested in knowing my philosophy toward the Prague summit, then you need only look as far as the speech I gave in Warsaw, Poland, that talked about a Europe whole, free, and at peace. I believe NATO expansion and in that speech, you'd see that I talked about NATO expansion as good for America, because a Europe whole, free, and at peace is good for America. I believe in the spirit of the countries that we are talking about. I believe in their spirit. These are countries that have lived under totalitarianism, and they understand the value of freedom. And they love freedom, and I love that spirit. I think that is going to be a very important part of invigorating the Alliance. The Alliance is a crucial alliance. It is a strong alliance. We are going into a new period. And the idea of having members that are willing to shoulder their share of the burden of keeping the peace with the new threats is good, and this spirit of understanding what totalitarianism can mean and understanding the responsibilities of being free nations-that come with being a free nation is very important at this summit. So I am really looking forward to it. I am excited to go to countries that have invited me to come. I look forward to the events. And so, with that, I will answer some questions. Why do not we start here? You are from? Yes, sir. I am from Romania. That is good. Sir, the Romanian people waited for the Americans after the World War II. We have waited for you almost 60 years. You know, the farmers were raising the corn in such a way that the American planes could land. That happened in '45 and the fifties. Now, for my parents, it might be a little bit late, but for my 11-years daughter, it might have a chance. You are coming to Bucharest next Saturday. This time are the Americans really coming to Romania? Great question. No more Munichs. No more Yaltas. America-I come to your country because I believe that Romania is an important part of a Europe which is whole and free and at peace. The story of Romania is a powerful story, of people taking charge of their own lives We had a click here, in case anybody is interested. This one right here. Poor planning? Nobody claims it? Should not have said poor planning. This is nobody's? Might be mine. It is yours? Yes. If it is out, it is out. That is okay. You do not want-if you have got to, turn it over. Getting quite articulate there. A lot of us watched the story of your country ridding yourselves of a totalitarian dictator, and it was a powerful story. But the story did not end there. The story ended with a desire for freedom and democracy and open markets. And the answer to your question is, absolutely. That is what the whole Prague summit is about: All for one, and one for all. We remember here in our country when, after the attacks of September the 11th, NATO stood up and said, An attack on the United States is an attack on us. I will say the same thing about Romania and Lithuania and the Czech Republic and anybody else that might be a member of NATO. And that is what I feel. I appreciate that question. That is -your question is one of the reasons I look so forward to going to Romania-- Thank you, sir. --to be able to provide that assurance in what is going to be a, as I understand it, magnificent event where, on the one hand, I will be able to point to statues of heroic liberators, people who believed in freedom, that freedom was ingrained in their soul, and on the other hand, point to a balcony where the dictator had his-he realized reality. It is - as a matter of fact, I was looking at my speech last night. I am from Lithuania, and Lithuania was recognized 11 years ago by your father -- Forty-one, we call him. --who took an active role in managing the collapse of the Soviet Union. How do you recall these times? Yes. Well, first, I want- I remember that, in terms of the Baltic states, that our country always viewed the Baltics as independent. During the Soviet era, we viewed the Baltics as independent. Secondly, I recall the times leading up to the collapse of the Soviet leadership, not only with my dad's actions as but those of as well, where there was clarity of thought, that there was no equivocation when it came to issues such as freedom. And I keep saying that word because it is an issue that we face collectively today in other parts of the world. Freedom is essentially a human condition. It is not an American gift. It is God's gift to the world. I believe that. I believe that everybody- the Almighty recognizes, through His mercy and grace, that people are-the freedom of each individual. Everybody counts. Everybody is precious. It was exciting times for Americans to watch the change in the Soviet Union, because it meant that the days of significant animosity could be ending. A lot of us grew up when the two big countries were fierce enemies, and the rest of the world watched to see whether or not there would be war and watched many times in horror as to whether or not there would be war, because the consequences of war between the Soviet Union and America would have been devastating for a lot of people. It looked like that, to us, that the collapse of the Soviet Union would provide an opportunity for peace. That is the most significant- that is the most exciting thing for me, that the relationship would be changed. I am honored to be in a position to help further the change of the relationship. I will answer the Russian journalist's question in a minute-I am not going to anticipate it- but I am going, after Prague, immediately to Russia for a reason. And anyway, it was exciting times for us. But the exciting-the true excitement is going to come when the people of the Baltics realize the world has changed dramatically, and it finally has changed dramatically in many ways, that Russia is not an enemy, that the United States is not an enemy of Russia, that the United States is still a friend of the Baltics. But most importantly, the Baltic people have got an opportunity now to realize their full potential. And that was what was 11 years ago we first saw, and it is an honor to be a continuing part of that history. ENTITY., I would like to ask you a question regarding Chechnya. Sure. I guess it will be one of the topics you will discuss with Mr. Putin-- Absolutely. Do you believe that after the latest events-mainly, after hostage in Moscow and after the statements made by Usama bin Laden raising the terrorist acts in Bali and Moscow, do you believe, ENTITY., that you can understand better this red-terrorists pose to Russia? And would you agree with , who says that the Chechen kind of terrorism vis-a-vis Russia is of the same nature as the Al Qaida terrorism to the United States? Right. You did not ask the question I thought you were going to ask. I am going to Russia to make it clear to the Russians and to Vladimir Putin, they have nothing to fear from NATO expansion, that a Baltic-the Baltics in NATO are positive for Russia. Now, my answer to your question-I thought you were going to ask why I am going to St. Petersburg. Anyway--and I am going-I did not hesitate when Vladimir and I talked about my trip to St. Petersburg, that it was very important for me to go there. And it was important for me say-explain why I think it is a positive development. Terrorism-first of all, I have got a good friend in the fight against terrorism in Vladimir Putin. He understands the stakes,MDNM and so do I. He understands that as you embrace freedom and embrace change and-that there will be people who resent that and want to impose their will. Secondly, I thought that at the theater that he was confronted with a very difficult situation. Eight hundred people were- were going to lose their lives. Clearly, these people were killers, just like the killers that came to America. There is a common-a common thread, that anytime anybody is willing to take innocent life for a so-called cause, they must be dealt with. And he made some very tough decisions. And people tried to blame Vladimir; they ought to blame the terrorists. They are the ones who caused the situation, not . Thirdly, I believe Chechnya can-I hope that Chechnya can be solved peacefully, that there is ways to discuss the political dialog in such a way that this issue can be solved peacefully. Thirdly, to the extent that there are Al Qaida members infiltrating Russia, they need to be dealt with; they need to be brought to justice. And I- you know, when Usama, praising these- the Muslim attacks in Chechnya, it is clear that there is an Al Qaida interest. That is why we are working so hard in Georgia with the Georgians to, one, encourage a dialog between Shevardnadze and , and two, develop a joint strategy to deal with the Al Qaida members which may be in the Pankisi Gorge. And so-but I will continue to talk to Vladimir about the need to protect and recognize the rights of minorities within any country and at the same time deal with terrorism. And I hope he can find that balance. I think he can. ENTITY., how do you assess the performance of the Czech Republic in NATO in preparation for this summit? Yes, well, first of all, they have been valuable members of NATO. I was able to express that to your President in his recent visit-who, by the way, is an outstanding human being and is highly respected and highly regarded in all of America. NATO has been-I mean, the Czech Republic has been a-was unhesitating in its support of Article 5 in NATO, for which I am grateful. Every conversation I have had with , he has been nothing more than anxious for the Czech Republic to perform its role within NATO. The interesting thing-let me give you kind of a broader statement about what you will see at the Prague summit-is that everybody has got something to contribute in the military capacities of NATO to deal with the new threats. And the Czech Republic certainly is such a country. There is going to be-I guess, the best word will be specialization-there needs to be a specialization as we develop the military capacity to deal with the true threat. Russia is not a threat, and therefore, the military strategies of NATO need to be changed to recognize that new reality. Russia is-Russia is a friend, not an enemy. NATO was formed because of the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact does not exist and, therefore, now-but there is a threat to all of us. And that is the threat in the form of international and global terrorism, which we must be able to deal with. The Czech Republic understands that. They are willing to help specialize. And it is up to the Czech Republic to determine that- along with Lord Robertson and his strategy-to determine how best to meet with the threats we face. Obviously, we have had good relations with the intelligence service of the Czech Republic, which is one of the key ingredients in order to fight terror. If you know somebody is thinking about doing something to us or we know somebody is thinking about doing something to you, we share intelligence. We have got good intelligence-sharing with Russia, by the way, now, because of the joint threat of global terror. It is a key ingredient in order to make sure we are able to find the new enemy. The enemy does not travel in army formations. They are killers. They take theaters. They crash airplanes into buildings. They bomb resorts. And we must know as much about their whereabouts and their plans as possible, in order to find them and bring them to justice. And therefore, there needs to be a different attitude about the threats we face. In terms of the Prague summit, I am mindful of what happens when the ENTITY shows up at times. I mean, it is-you know, there is going to be a lot of noise and clamor. But I am actually confident that the Czech Republic will do a fine job. It is a big deal that this city of Prague hosts this, and nations from all over Europe coming and-plus the Canadians and ourselves. I am sure there is going to be people who are willing to express their voices, that maybe perhaps think NATO- something about NATO is not the way they like it, or whatever it may be. We believe in free speech. Hopefully, they will have an opportunity to speak freely in a way that is not-that does not promote violence. But the thing that impresses me most about the Czech Republic and its Government is, in spite of the terrible flood, devastating floods, that this Government and these people are anxious to host this meeting and will be able to do so in a great way. And it shows the great character of the people, to rise above the devastation to be able to host this summit. So I am really looking forward to it. I cannot wait to get there and will be there soon. ENTITY., what symbol would you associate to Romania on the new NATO map? I mean, where is the place of Romania in this new NATO map? How do you mean, what is the place? What do you mean-well, first of all, you are getting me caught-if these countries get in-. But the fact that I am going to your country I guess says something. We hope so. Right now I am off the record. Anyway--first of all, the map is more than just countries on a piece of paper; the map is an attitude. It is an attitude that says that we want to work toward open markets and open societies and transparency and fight corruption. We want to participate in the global war against terror in a way that we are capable of doing so. Physically, of course, Romania will be the leading edge of Europe extending its reach into Eastern Europe. And it is a significant reach. It is-today, it is interesting, the Vice President and I were being briefed on an issue, and we looked at the map, and the Vice President said, I have trouble adjusting to the actual map of NATO. In other words, the point was that NATO now- NATO's reach is far east. And Romania represents that eastern reach. So physically it is a significant statement of the power of an alliance and the willingness of a people to adopt the habits necessary to have a free society. It is -I think that is probably the most significant thing about the NATO map. It is an attitude. It is the soul of NATO, like I described earlier. But it is the presence of Romania-really recognizes the change. And it is a significant change. It is an historic-this will be an historic day, our meeting on one day-Thursday, I think is the day-in which the decision will be actually announced. Although-ENTITY., although, yes-recognize the annexation and occupation of Lithuanian, to most Americans our country was unknown territory for a long time. And can you recall, when did you first and what hear about Lithuania? And what did you think of Lithuania at that time? And what do you think now? Well, there is a lot of Lithuanian Americans who kept the hope alive of a free and independent Lithuania in America, not so much in my home State of Texas, mainly in the Midwest. And I think a lot of people took pity on the people of Lithuania, given the circumstances. And the Government took its position. But there was a patience by our leadership that eventually freedom would prevail. Lithuania is kind of a-it is got kind of a-all the Baltics, for that matter-have got an interesting kind of romance because it is a small country. It is totally overwhelmed, divided up. It is kind of handed out as pieces of a-pieces of a settlement that saddened a lot of Americans. But nobody ever gave up hope, I think. Most Americans never gave up hope that the Baltics would some day be able to realize their vast potential. I am going to tell you an interesting story. This is from another Baltic country. It is from the Prime Minister of Estonia, came to see me. I am very hesitant to put words into another leader's mouth. They tend to do it to me, and I do not like it. So I would paraphrase, loosely paraphrase. He was there at the time when-and one of the things I do is welcome a lot of leaders to America; it is an interesting experience. I have done so with the Lithuanian leadership as well. And I said-this is the day where I told our Congress we were going to encourage a national debate and dialog on IraAnd I started to give him my rationale as to why I was thinking about IraHe said, You do not need to talk to me -this is paraphrasing now-about IraHe said, Our country has watched democracies go soft in the face of totalitarianism, and we lived in slavery for 50 years. Now, that is a paraphrase for the American press. But the point I want to make to you is that he was clear about obligations we have. That is what I think about the Baltics. The spirit-and Romania, for that matter, and the Czech Republic, as embodied in the works and thoughts of Vaclav Havel. That is what I think about your country. You know, I firmly believe that-again, I keep repeating myself, but it is on my mind because this is exactly what we are dealing with at the NATO expansion. And this is the concept of how precious freedom is for people. It is a-and it has a lot to do, frankly, with my thinking about Iraq too. The fact that people are tortured and subjugated, are not free to realize their potential, really bothers me. I think we have an obligation to work to free people. There is all kinds of ways to do it, but we have that obligation. It does not happen as quickly sometimes as we would like. But that is an obligation of all of us who have got-who live in free countries. You have that obligation. But there is no doubt you will recognize that obligation because you are freshly free from subjugation. And that is what I was talking about, about the invigoration of the soul of NATO. That is what I think about when I think about the Baltics. ENTITY., you mentioned Iraq. Yes. Do you believe that Russian support of the U.N. resolution on Iraq has promoted any kind of reconciliation between the position of Russia and America on this matter? And what would you like to tell to President Putin in regard to-- Oh, yes. Well, first, I appreciate them working together with us on the resolution. The U.N. Security Council sent a clear signal to Iraq and the world. We expect them to disarm, is what the signal said. And actually, the U.N. Security Council sent a signal about themselves, that they want to be relevant. You see, if you send out 16 resolutions and all 16 resolutions were ignored, at some point in time, somebody has got to tell the truth and say, You are not relevant. Why pass a resolution unless you really mean it? And so we got together, and we said, Fine, let us pass this significant resolution. And the Russians were helpful and voted for it. And now the word is out, that the U.N. Security Council will be a relevant body. In other words, we intend to enforce the serious consequences if there is not disarmament, and that we are able to work with our friends. I thought that was a very positive thing. And I will tell this to Vladimir Putin. It is probably better for me to tell him, but not through your newspapers, but I will try anyway. The issue is not inspectors. The issue is disarmament. That is the issue. And the question is, will Saddam Hussein disarm? That is what the U.N. Security Council has said, once again, with Russian support, along with other-a lot of other countries. And so he must show us whether or not he will disarm, for the sake of peace. And if he does not , then we, of course, will consult, like we said we would do- we'd hold a meeting. But the interesting thing about the U.N. Security Council resolution is, all countries are free to act. And that was explained to Vladimir what my sentiments-I am very strong about. This is not a-this is not a free pass for Saddam, now that the resolution has been passed. Quite the contrary. We expect him to disarm. And we expect him to do everything he can to disarm. And we expect him to be cooperating in his disarmament for the sake of peace. And that is what the U.N. Security Council said to me, that people now have finally come to the conclusion that it is time now to deal with the issue. Hopefully, this can get done peacefully. But it is up to Mr. Saddam Hussein, and we will see. It is time for him to declare if he is got any weapons. And we will proceed from there. ENTITY., will you ask the allies in Prague to contribute to military action if such action becomes necessary? I will-first of all, I believe that the NATO Alliance understands the issue. The countries there would like to see a disarmed Saddam Hussein. They- a peaceful country, they believe in peace, just like I believe in peace. And a Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is-particularly since he is used them in the past, and he clearly cannot stand America and many of our friends-would mean it would be likely for us not to have peace. Imagine a Saddam Hussein with a nuclear weapon. It is certainly not an ingredient for peace, quite the contrary. And so the NATO countries understand that. And if, in fact, military action is needed, we will consult with them, and everybody will be able to make a decision that they are comfortable with. But I would not preclude a peaceful settlement. I hope it happens peacefully. But if it does not , just-people will know that our intent is to lead a coalition of like-minded, freedom-loving countries, a coalition of the willing to disarm Saddam Hussein. And one way or the other, he is going to be disarmed, and it is in everybody's interest that that be the case. So we will talk about that. All right? Thank you for your time. Now, are you going on these trips? You are going to go to the NATO summit? That is going to be exciting. How many journalists will be there? Two thousand seven hundred-that was the last figure I note from Prague before I came here. Two thousand seven hundred. Including TV crews. Wow. Well, I cannot wait for my press conference. I am going to have about a 2-hour press conference there in front of 2,700. Two days. Two days. Just kidding, Steve . Cannot wait for that. You are going? Yes, sir. It is going to be exciting. It is going to be a very exciting time. And so you have just come from Prague? Yes. So you tell me what the feeling is like there in the city. Well, the city is almost evacuated, in expecting the summit, because-- The city is evacuated? No, I am joking, but the area around the conference center is almost evacuated. And the kids, they have holiday, and the shops are going to be closed, and the center of the city, Wenceslas Square where the demonstrations usually take place, is under police surveillance. So Prague is getting ready, so everyone is expecting how to get to work in-they are making arrangements. Yes. And how many people are coming, just total? Do they have an estimate? From outside the Czech Republic. More than 2,000 people-I mean, delegations and-- Oh, it is got to be way more than that. --with the staff and everything. Well, the press is 2,700 alone. I bet there is -our mighty delegation-. But only two hotels were affected by the floods. Only two of the number of the hotels that are ready for-to accommodate the delegations and-- They are ready? --only two hotels were badly affected by the floods. Otherwise-- How is the recovery from the floods? It was bad. It was tough, and now it is getting better. There are some neighborhoods in Prague where people cannot return to their homes because of the-- Still? --and it is not only Prague. It is the whole country, going into Germany. So sad. So it is very bad. No chronicle-no person ever remembers such a disaster. It is a 500-year flood. A thousand. A 1,000-year flood. Wow, that is too bad. But as we say, Charles did it-from the 14th century. President's Visits to Europe Well, I am glad the country is recovering. We are really looking forward to it and looking forward to our trips, too. They are going to be magnificent. We expect more people than for the Pope in 1999. Really? It is going to be exciting. I am looking forward to it. I better make sure my speech is-I think they will like it. All right. We will see you there. Thanks. Thanks for coming. I am looking forward to going to St. Petersburg again. Yes, sure. Thank you very much. The second time in one year. Maybe a third time. Did you like it? Yes, it was spectacular. Remember, we went out on the boat, Vladimir, myself, Sergey Ivanov, floated a- White Nights. Fantastic. It will not be White Nights this time, though. Will be white days, right, snowing? Yes, snowing. We will see you all there.

{"id": 546, "text": "Mr. ENTITY , Mr. Mitterrand is the first French ENTITY who is a Socialist ENTITY in France, and he invites his fellow heads of states and governments to a king's palace. How do you feel about all that? Having been a visitor at Versailles myself once before, some years ago, I am looking forward to it, seeing all that beauty again. Wasn't Louis XIV known as the Sun King? Maybe we will all 'go there for enlightenment. How close are you with Mr. Mitterrand and what kind of relationship do you have? How often do you communicate with him on what you feel? I do not know what the schedule has been for previous ENTITY s, but in this year and a half or so that I have been here, I have met several times with all the leaders that I will be meeting at Versailles. And we are all on a first-name basis, no titles. We have had, I think, a very friendly relationship, a very open relationship in the meetings that we have had in Ottawa and Cancun, here in Washington. I think it is been most helpful. I think we have a closer relationship, perhaps, than has existed before, and I mean all the leaders of the North Atlantic Alliance and all who will be at Versailles. But, in between the meetings, do you communicate, and how, with the language barrier and all? We have to resort to interpreters, and I have learned to get along with that. Some of the others speak some English. I had a couple of years of schoolboy French many, many years ago, because it was compulsory in the school that I attended. But I could not rely on it myself now. I should not be taking up all this time, but I told the ENTITY about an experience that I had with having to use French the first time that I ever went to France. I went with a couple from England, had been in London for the winter, and we went across the Channel in the spring to go down to the south of France. I did not know that they had never crossed the Channel before, and they knew not one word of French, and we were going to drive in their car. I realized that if there was any communication it was going to be up to me. And we were coming to a town where we were going to have lunch. I was thinking and trying to dredge up all the words that I could remember on how to find the best cafe. As words began to come back to me I sort of padded my part, and we did arrive in a little town. There was a gendarme in the street. We pulled up beside him and by this time I was ready. I said, Pardon, monsieur, j'ai grand faim. Ou est le meilleur caf'e? - I am very hungry and where is the best cafe? And he told me, and my friend who was driving says, What did he say? I said, I have not the slightest idea. I could rehearse the question. I could not rehearse the answer. Mr. ENTITY , if I can pick up again on your personal contact, you met 11 months ago in Ottawa with six Western European heads of state and governments, and you will all be meeting again together soon. What have you accomplished since then, not only on a personal level but also in terms of politics? What have you accomplished collectively, for instance, that you could not accomplish separately? I have always believed that a lot of problems are resolved if you are talking to each other, instead of about each other. And I think that there have been tensions in the past that have affected us as allies and friends. We all share a great many mutual problems. We are all having economic problems. Unemployment is a problem for us. And I think that the personal bond that we have established has created a relationship that is very close and that makes us able to discuss openly and freely those things that are of mutual interest to us, those problems where maybe we can solve them better together than we can by going our own ways. Last year you heard some complaints from the Europeans on the high rates of interest in the United States, and you told them that the United States was suffering from those high rates as well. Certainly your recession looks a little bit more credible now. Now the Europeans are complaining about unemployment, which does great damage to the socio-economic fabric of Western Europe. What will you tell them now, given the fact that unemployment is also a problem in this country, the slow recovery-what will you be discussing with them in concrete ways to face this problem? I think that the answer has to be a correction. You cannot correct unemployment unless you correct the problems that have caused a virtually worldwide recession. These have to do with trade, imports and exports. All the things that we can put on the table that may be restricting the free flow of trade, that could stimulate markets, are essential to that. When I hear the feeling about the high interest rates, I believe there was an honest misunderstanding that they thought these were somehow a part of our economic policy; that we were using high interest rates because of our double-digit inflation. They were not part of our policy, and I think the other leaders realize that we have here in the Federal Reserve System an autonomous body that is not subject to pressure of any kind from those of us who hold office. In addition, the interest rates are set by the marketplace itself, the money market. We believe that in our case the high interest rates were the result of inflation. Now we have brought inflation down. The doomcriers were saying a year ago that it would take 10 years to get a handle on the inflation problem. Well, month before last inflation actually disappeared for a month in America, and we had deflation. This past month it came up just a fraction of a percentage point. For the last 6 months inflation has been around 3 percent. I think we are going to see even more improvement compared to 1980-1981 as we go on through the year. We think this is a big factor in getting interest rates down, and if we and Congress can get the savings that we are asking for in the budget for 1983, we think it will send a signal to the money markets that will bring interest rates down further. We do not believe that we were the causes of Europe's problems. We could point to Italy's own interest rates, which are twice and three times the interest rates of Germany and Japan, and I do not think they have had any effect on those countries. But I think that the leaders of Europe and Japan now understand that this was not a deliberate part of an economic policy. This was a problem that we are trying to lick. If I could follow up on that point, Mr. ENTITY , while inflation has come down, most of the other economic indicators are still fairly grim. They talk about the rate of corporation failures, savings that have not really picked up, and unemployment, of course, is at more-or-less record levels. And then there is the record budget deficit as well. Now, at Ottawa last year, you linked the question of interest rates to a revitalization of the U.S. economy, but this revitalization does not seem to have started yet. Can you say what has gone wrong from this end, and when will you be able to assure the European leaders that happy days are here again ? I do not believe that anything has gone wrong. I think that many people confuse the adoption by Congress of the first phase of our plan with the plan being in operation. We believe very much in the incentive tax package that we passed with its reducing of taxes. But that is to be spread over a 3-year period. We had asked for, originally, three yearly 10-percent cuts. We got one 5-percent cut, and the other two were 10-percent, but they have not yet gone into effect. We had also asked those tax cuts be retroactive to January 1st, 1981. In the compromise that goes on in a parliament or a congress, we had to take the best that we could get. The 5-percent cut, not 10, did not go into effect until last October. We did see an immediate increase in personal savings rates after that had happened because of some features of the tax program. But if there is an incentive to those tax cuts, as we believe there is, we have to wait until the people are actually getting those cuts and having that extra money in their pockets. The next cut-the 10-percent cut-will go into effect July 1st and then the next one in July of 1983. I think we have to wait and see when the program is actually in operation, when the effects are felt, not just the fact that you could point to a piece of legislation and say it is been passed into law. Wait until it takes effect. In the last 6 months of 1980, during the campaign, the increase in our money supply, the flooding of paper money, was the highest it has ever been in our history-a 13-percent rate. With it came the interest rates that skyrocketed to 21 1/2 percent, and we had 2 years back to back of double-digit inflation. When I took office, inflation was 12.4 percent. Now, they pulled the string on the money market at about that same time, way below the normal needs. So, we have had a problem with high interest rates; they have hung on for too long. From the very first, getting our cuts in government spending, the billions of dollars in reductions, was a top priority. The annual rate of increase in government spending was 17 percent in 1980. We cut that in half in the first year that we were here. With that action, the interest rates did come down about 20 percent-not enough, but they did come down. But the unemployment had begun in 1979. We had a recession in 1980. And it continued along with this market dislocation and inflation. Unemployment and recession increase government costs quite considerably. On the evidence of history, unemployment is the last thing that recovers when you are coming out of a recession. We think the indices are all there, that we are in the trough and have bottomed out in the recession. From the very first, we said that we could not hope for recovery until the last half of this year and we think in the last half we are going to see that recovery. How far is that recovery dependent on you breaking the budget stalemate? Do you think you will have that stalemate ended by the time you go to Europe? I think it is very important. I think the money market is waiting to see if the Congress will-since we do not dominate or have the majority of both Houses-stay with its old-fashioned policies of artificial stimulation and quick fixes to cure things. All they ever did was temporarily reduce the fever, and then a couple of years later we had an even worse recession each time. But if the money markets see that Congress will do what it did last year and stay with us on our plan, making the further reductions that we are asking for in spending and stay with our tax program, I think that this will be the signal that will bring interest rates down. There have been scattered signs in the money market that they want them down also. Those signs are in various areas-our automobile industry, which is hard hit, and mainly because of the interest rates. Our people buy cars, as I am sure they do elsewhere, on the installment plan. They have to pay interest such as the mortgage on a house. This has hurt the automobile market. Here and there in the country, groups of local bankers have come together and put up sums of money specified for automobile loans at a rate of interest about 4 points below the market. As long as that money lasted, they would lend it at that lower interest rate for those who want to buy automobiles. The upsurge in automobile buying was instant. We have also seen some construction companies that evidently were able to liquidate their inventory of newly built houses by pulling down the interest rates themselves. We think that this indicates that the money market is ready and wants lower rates. But they have to be sure that we have inflation down for good-that it is not going to go zooming back up. Mr. ENTITY , there is another summit looming, the NATO summit at Bonn. It is almost like an Alpine assault. You scale one summit after another. As one talks about NATO nowadays, immediately you are into this crisis talk. We have had a year behind us where things did not all go smoothly. Relations between America and the European allies were somewhat strained. Indeed, there are cries right now in Congress for a withdrawal of American troops to show the Europeans how upset you are and how unsatisfied with their performance. How much do you think is true about this crisis talk? Do you view the alliance in a similar way? And if so, where would you say one can improve the performance? I think it has improved. The recent meeting of ministers in Luxembourg indicates this. When we came into office, there were some strains in the alliance. And there was some ill-feeling on both sides. We set out to resolve that. I think we have done it. I believe in the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. The fact that we have had 37 years of peace in Europe is the greatest proof of NATO's effectiveness. We have no intention of withdrawing troops. We recognize our responsibility there. We recognize that those troops are not there, as some have said in congressional debate, because we are generously doing something for someone else. Our own security is involved. We are there because that NATO line is our first line of defense as well. I do not think that there is any crisis at all. I think that NATO is on a better footing than it has been for several years. Where there could be and have been some problems at the southern flank of NATO, we are working on them and have come to some better agreements there. You mean Greece and Turkey? Yes. Can you envisage a likely scenario or a constellation of political crises where America would have to look beyond NATO, because it had global commitments, and where the importance for you of NATO would be diminished and you would have to go back to your NATO allies and say they will have to pick up more for their own defenses, because you have global commitments which require a greater deployment of American forces? So far, in spite of the economic problems that beset Europe as well as the United States, I think that their defense spending level has been consistent. And I have no quarrel with it at all. As evidence of the improved situation, could I point out that we have had cooperation from our NATO allies with regard to the multinational force in the Sinai. Yet when we came in a year ago, we had not been able to find a single country that wanted to participate in that. Now they have. I think that a subject for discussion with NATO would be that we all, together, look at the Persian Gulf and the Middle East as an area of concern because of our energy dependence on this particular area. But I think the allies are holding up their end very well. There is a better, sounder relationship than we have had in the past. Part of the question of how well NATO is doing seems to be tied into the question of East-West relations in general. And we have heard that you now favor a summit with your Soviet counterpart. You used to tie this to the condition that some summit meetings should have a tangible outcome or result. Do you feel the time has come where such a meeting could accomplish something concrete? I would hope so, because I think that the Soviet Union also has some very real problems. Maybe it is time for someone to point out to them that their attitude of hostility, their worldwide aggression, their denial of human rights, whatever it is based on-whether it is a concern that they are threatened by the Western world or whether it is just determination to pursue the Marxist-Leninist theory of world domination-point out to them that the road to peace and giving up that aggressive attempt might be helpful to them with their own economic problems. If there is any truth to the belief of some that the Soviet Union is motivated by fear of the West, that they think the West is going to threaten them-I do not think there is anyone in the West who believes that for one minute. They could have a guarantee of peace tomorrow if they themselves would follow the words of Demosthenes 2,000 years ago in the Athenian marketplace when he said, What sane man would let another man's words rather than his deeds tell him who is at peace and who is at war with him. So far, it is the West that has to feel that the Soviet Union is at war with us on the basis of their great military buildup. I do not think they can point to anything from our side that indicates that. What if back some years ago after World War II when our country was the only one with the nuclear weapon and really the only one left undamaged by war, in a position to do as we did, to go to the aid of our allies and even our former enemies; what if the situation had been reversed and the Soviet Union had had that bomb and not anyone in the West? If we had an aggressive intent would not we have acted then when we could have done so easily? I think that is the greatest guarantee that it is not the West that threatens the world with war. Mr. ENTITY , may I ask you a question about the essence of the Presidency, because on paper you are the most powerful man on Earth. I keep telling my wife that. In practice you have, at least, some difficulties with heavy interest rates, even avoiding a war in the Falklands. What in your view are the limits of the Presidency? What can you really achieve? Sometimes I ask myself that question. There are limits, of course, great limits on the Presidency because the very nature of our government, and our Constitution has prescribed them to an extent beyond anything, I think, known in any other country. Many countries have constitutions but most of them say in their constitution, We, the government, grant you, the people, these things. Our Constitution says, We, the people will allow government to do only these things that we permit in the Constitution. That is reflected in this supposed power of the Presidency. cannot dismiss a Congress, and, unlike the parliamentary system, you do not automatically have a majority in what constitutes our parliament, our Congress. In one of the two houses I have a majority of the opposition party. In the other house, the Senate, I have a bare majority of our party, and that is the first time that is been true for a Republican ENTITY in 25 years. Mr. ENTITY , in a few days you will be visiting the four major European partners of the United States in the Atlantic Alliance. Three of these, West Germany, Britain, and Italy, pledged to go ahead and modernize the nuclear weapons of NATO, a decision that was taken in December 1979. In fact, my country has already started work on our cruise missile bases. How do you assess the contribution of Italy and generally what is the prospect for productive negotiations in the area of intermediate nuclear forces? I must tell you we are very grateful to Italy for its forthrightness with which it stepped forward with regard to preparations for basing of those intermediate missiles. We know why the missiles have been requested of us by NATO. There are 900 warheads on 300 SS-20 missiles the Soviets have targeted on all of Europe and nothing comparable to counter them. The NATO decision came for Pershing missiles and cruise missiles as a deterrent to prevent the Soviets continuing that monopoly. I know that politically in Europe this was a great problem in a number of countries because of the peace movement. Some people cannot quite see that unilateral disarmament is not the road to peace. But Italy was very forthright in coming forth on the preparations. We appreciate it very much. I must also salute the West German, the British, and the Belgian Governments for their leadership on this critical issue. ENTITY Mitterrand also shares our deep concern over the Soviet buildup. The very fact that countries of Western Europe have said they were willing to base these missiles and we were willing to provide them is why the Soviets agreed to go to Geneva to meet when I proposed-why do not we negotiate a total elimination of such weapons in Europe? We will not put in the Pershings and cruise missiles if they will do away with the SS-20's. I do not think they would have ever come to negotiate had it not been for the imminence of that proposal-the fact that we are all going forward. I would hope that before all those missiles are in place on our side, we would have negotiated an agreement in which they will be unnecessary and the Soviets will remove theirs. Are you sanguine about the prospects of these negotiations? Can they be achieved apart and before, perhaps, a larger START agreement? We have completed our arrangements and proposals here to go forward with the START which has to do with the intercontinental missiles. Again, I believe that we are getting the evidence of willingness from the Soviet Union to at least negotiate, to talk, because we are going forward with the rebuilding of our own military and because our allies have shown their own determination on the intermediate weapons. In recent years when we were letting our defenses crumble and were virtually unilaterally disarming, there was no incentive for the Soviet Union to meet us in any kind of arms reduction talks because they were engaged in the most massive buildup the world has ever seen at the same time we were apparently not willing to even try and keep pace. I think it was explained in a cartoon in one of our papers recently. It was Brezhnev speaking to a Russian general and he said, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. Mr. ENTITY , your speech at Eureka on strategic arms, your administration's previous commitment to the concept' of linkage, the concept Whereby you link arms control negotiations, East-West trade, summitry with the Soviet Union with political progress by the Soviet Union on things like Poland and Afghanistan-this was conspicuous by its absence. Does this mean that you have abandoned the principle of linkage? No, not at all. And let me point out that in the many times that I have spoken of that concept, I have never particularly linked it to something as specific as arms reductions talks. But it was done in the context of the summit meetings that have taken place with regard to trade and to features of detente. I view it in that context but that does not rule it out even for arms reduction talks. I could answer it very briefly. Much of what is concerned in that linkage, some of the very subjects you talked about, are not things that you headline in the paper. The fact that you do not proclaim such subjects or put them up there in the newspaper does not mean that they cannot be brought up when you are sitting at a table. I think sometimes that politically to publicly discuss things of that kind makes it politically impossible to get them, where maybe in what I have called quiet diplomacy you secure them. I would like to ask you to expand a little bit on what you have said the Luxembourg meeting of NATO foreign ministers accomplished. There was a communiqu last week that says a more constructive East-West relationship aiming at genuine detente through dialog and negotiations and mutually advantageous exchanges should be aimed at. Now, that is a very positive, sort of upbeat approach. Yet we know we are going to discuss the pipeline, we are going to discuss credits' curtailment and so forth. Where are the limits of cooperation with the East? Where do you think we have gone beyond them? If I understand the question correctly, I think it gets back to something I was saying earlier. We have tried ever since World War II to simply persuade the Soviets. There have been our own efforts at arms reduction-I think there have been 19 such efforts since World War II-but in other things we have simply tried to persuade. It seems to me that now, with the Soviets having the economic problems I mentioned, that this is an opportunity for us to suggest to them that there might be a better path than they have been taking. And if so, we'd like to explore that better path. Do not you think the pipeline deal is a good idea to suggest to them, that this could be done, as a deal? Our thought about the pipeline was that it was being given without the quid pro quo of some change in attitude and that there was a danger to Europe in making itself too dependent on the Soviet Union as an energy source. I think that is still something that Europe should look at and see if they want to be that dependent on someone who has 900 nuclear warheads aimed at them. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY . A man who once sat at that desk, Theodore Roosevelt, said that the Presidency is a bully pulpit-the pulpit where the clergyman preaches sermons. It is that. I think this office does offer an opportunity for mobilizing public sentiment behind worthwhile causes. To that extent, there is a power that should be used properly and for the right causes that goes with this office. Will you tell that to the Pope, who you will be seeing in Rome? I am looking forward to meeting him. He is an example of what so many people have always said about Christian and Judaic tradition, and that is that when really needed, God provides a man. And I think in Pope John Paul he did just that. I am looking forward to the meeting. We can even both talk about our operations. Do you think since you have been in office that the public spirit in this country has been enhanced? What do you think about the American public spirit? This goes to some of the questions that you were asking about whether we have done anything in the last year and a half. Before I took office in 1980, in polls and surveys that were being taken all the time, there was one question that was frequently asked. Many answered that they saw no hope in the future. Not only were things bad, but they did not see any signs they were going to get better. Now we are in this deep recession and the same question is being asked. Many American people are saying, yes, things are bad, but we expect them to get better; we know they are going to get better, and they talk about next year and the year beyond, that they will be better. It is a turnaround of what the public attitude was, just a year and a half ago.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrepresentativeswesterneuropeanpublications", "title": "Interview With Representatives of Western European Publications", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-representatives-western-european-publications", "publication_date": "21-05-1982", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 70, "text": "ENTITY Thank you for having us. Thank you so much for being here. I have to say that the initial responses to your speech in Germany have been skeptical, guarded, all the way to disappointed, even from sources who are normally very pro-American. They expected more. Does that surprise you? No, it does not surprise me. Because I think that, first of all, a lot of suspicion had been built up in Germany and, frankly, around the world, in the wake of the Snowden disclosures. And it is going to take some time to win back trust. And if you look at what we have done, though, it really is unprecedented: What I have put forward is a presidential directive that very clearly indicates what we will do and will not do when it comes to overseas surveillance. And I indicated very specifically that we do not listen to people's phone calls or read their emails if there are no national security threats involved, that we will, for the first time, I think, ever, include our concerns about the privacy rights of all persons, regardless of nationality. We have laid very clear criteria by which we approach bulk collection, that there are only very narrow instances in which we can engage in that kind of collection. And I made very clear the limits on collections for our friends' and our allies' heads of state. So if you take the body of what I said publicly, what we have done is something that no country around the world has been as clear about when it comes to their intelligence services, even as we do have to maintain the intelligence capabilities that do not just help to keep us safe, but also help to keep our friends and allies, including Germans, safe. But people see this immense size of the American security and spying apparatus. And they look at that, they look at your speech today, as well and they say: Listen, what I want is that no agency like that is collecting any data from people in Germany. They should just stop that, unless you have specific reasons to look for this person, like the Hamburg cell of 9/11 and so on. But of course, here is the challenge: We do not always know who the Hamburg cell is, until after the fact. So you have to listen to everybody until then? No, well but that is not what happens. We are not listening to everybody. And I think it is very important to make that clear. And this is part of the reason why it is going to take time to win back trust, because there is been so much sensationalism around these issues. One of the issues that I discussed for example today, the 215 program of telephone metadata, that I have determined we will end government collection of this data. But this is data that does not include names, does not include content. It is essentially a series of phone numbers so that when we have a specific lead ? let us say we find a number in an Al-Qaeda compound ? we can find out whether that number contacted a number inside the United States or, for that matter, inside of Germany. And there are legitimate concerns, though, about the government holding this data and those are some of the concerns that we have tried to address. Now, one of the things that I have said throughout the speech is: I am very sympathetic to why the German people would be concerned about this. Obviously, there is a history there with respect to East Germany that tells us what happens if you have a vast surveillance state and it turns on its own citizens. Here in the United States, as I mentioned, there have been times where surveillance has been abused. And I would not be in the seat I am today, were it not for figures like Dr. King who, at times, our own government spied on, in ways that were inappropriate. So what I am trying to do is to make sure on the one hand that a group like the Hamburg cell we can identify before rather than after they have killed a whole lot of innocent people, but also to create a series of safeguards and limits, checks, an oversight so that the process whereby we are doing that is not something that would lead the ordinary German or American or Brazilian to think that our networks are somehow reading their text messages that they are sending to their spouses. Understood. But still, the metadata of people in Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, are somewhere stored where, with a couple of judicial steps, American authorities, your agencies have access to. That will remain. Well, I have to be careful about what details I can and cannot discuss here. But I think that it is absolutely true that US intelligence has a series of capabilities that allow us to access digital information, not just here in the United States but around the world. Those capabilities are not unique to us... But yours are bigger. ... a whole lot of intelligence agencies have them. Well, you are right. Ours are bigger. And I discussed in the speech the fact that the challenge we have is that our capabilities are significantly greater than many other countries'. In some ways, it is parallel to the fact that our military capabilities and our budgets are significantly greater than others'. Now, you can look at that in two ways. Because we have greater capabilities it also means we have greater responsibilities for humanitarian assistance for helping to keep our allies safe. I think it is fair to say that there are a whole series of European countries who are very glad that the US has those military capabilities and intelligence capabilities. And so in some ways we underwrite a lot of the security needs and defenses of countries around the world. What is also true is, because we have these greater capabilities, it means that we have greater responsibilities when it comes to privacy protection than other countries do. It means that there are higher expectations placed on us than other countries. And what I am trying to do is to create a framework, at a time when we are seeing technology advance very rapidly, to figure out how do we do this in a way that is respectful of the privacy of individuals, but at the same time is making clear that our law enforcement officials and our intelligence officials are able to do the things they need to do. And the interesting thing is, in some ways, the United States has gotten faster to a place that I suspect over time everybody is going to get to, which is that more and more of our information is stored digitally. That is very useful. We take advantage of it in all sorts of ways. But it also means that some of the traditional safeguards and checks that we had in protecting our privacy are going to have to be updated. And that is why part of what I said in the speech was: I do not consider this an end point. I think this is the beginning of a discussion. And we are engaged in conversations with the German government, with German intelligence and we will continue to try to refine how we cooperate, how we are respectful of German traditions and German laws and how we can also continue the kind of cooperation that is important not only to our people but also the German people. Cooperation. You said that Angela Merkel's cellphone will not be monitored anymore. Nice to hear. Let us take the situation of 2002 / 2003, when Germany, France and others really tried to pull together a coalition in the United Nations, against the interests of the United States or United States policy at the time. Would that be a good moment to hear what chancellor Schroeder at the time was saying to the French president? You know, I have to tell you I cannot comment on what happened in 2003 / 2004. But I understand the general point of your question which is: Is this something that chancellor Merkel or her successors can count on? This is a presidential directive. So I am saying what I will do under my administration. My hope would be that future presidents will follow the example that I am trying to set at this point. What I can say is that chancellor Merkel and I may have disagreements on foreign policy... But that is not the reason to listen in to... That is exactly right. That is what I was about to say. I am a bit rushed because I feel that you are not getting to a point. Even if we have disagreements of any sort, the one thing that I know is that I have established a relationship of friendship and trust with her, in part because she is always very honest with me and I try to be very honest with her. I do not need and I do not want to harm that relationship by a surveillance mechanism that somehow would impede the kind of communication and trust that we have. And so what I can say is: As long as I am ENTITY of the United States, the chancellor of Germany will not have to worry about this. But there are limits, even within NATO allies. We have a very difficult situation in Turkey right now. Your intelligence agencies must be interested in communications of president Erdogan. Would he be off limits because ENTITY does not want this to happen? I am not going to comment on country by country. I am just trying to understand the principle. I think what you will see in the directive is that we have close friends and allies that we work with consistently and it is important for us and for me as ENTITY of the United States to maintain the trust of those colleagues who I work with so closely. Now, as I said in the speech, our intelligence agencies, like German intelligence agencies, and every intelligence agency out there, will continue to be interested in the government intentions of countries around the world. That is not going to change. And there is no point in having an intelligence service if you are restricted to the things that you can read in the New York Times or DER SPIEGEL. The truth of the matter is that by definition the job of intelligence is to find out: Well, what are folks thinking? What are they doing? That helps service our diplomatic and our policy aims. But I think the point you made earlier is the critical one: We have greater capabilities than most countries around the world. It is important for us, then, particularly as technology advances, to make sure we are showing some self-restraint in how we approach this. What you hear today is my first effort at providing that restraint in ways that can assure the German people and the German chancellor and other partners and friends around the world that we are not behaving in ways that would violate their privacy. And the truth of the matter is that it will take some time to win that trust back. And I think that is entirely appropriate. But, hopefully, the German people will recall also the incredible partnership that we have and all the good that we have done together and the incredible investment that the United States has in the success of Germany and the defense of Germany. On a personal note a last question, although I am getting a signal. I was there covering your speech at the victory column, standing about one hundred feet from you, one of the most exciting assignments I had. What you cannot know that hundreds of meters away, people who could not even see the stage, certainly not you, were listening in a way that you heard a pin drop. There was so much hope and expectation in the air of Berlin on that day. And today, five years into the presidency, our polls indicate this has basically melted away. A lot of disappointment in your policy and performance has established itself. So how do you think that could happen? Well, look. I think that the nature of being ENTITY is that you are steering a massive ship. And I have a clear vision, which I described in Berlin that day and which I described in speeches that I made when I was running for office in 2008, of where I think we need to go, of how we uphold dignity and freedom of all individuals, of how countries should relate to each other, of how we should promote economic growth that is good for all people and not just those at the very top. And those values continue to drive what I do every day. Where disappointment typically comes in, and this is natural, is that people think I am driving a speed boat and that I can... You would rather. ...quickly move in that direction and I get there and by this time, four years after the fact, I would have ended all wars and I would have brought the world together and the economy would be humming along. And, unfortunately, although I would love to be in that position, ENTITY is not emperor of the world. I am one figure, one man in this broader process and what I try to do, then, is to, every single day, move us a little bit closer to that vision I set. And my hope is that at the end of my presidency, over the course of eight years, there will be a body of work where people will say: He ended the war in Iraq responsibly. He ended the war in Afghanistan responsibly. He was able to move our war footing after 9/11 into a greater focus on diplomacy and building multi-lateral agreements and institutions, that he advanced the cause of dealing with climate change, even if it is not completely solved. If I can show that, as a consequence to the work that I did, we are closer to that vision that I described in Berlin, then it will have been time well spent. But I assure you that anybody who feels frustrated at the slow pace of our progress in some of these areas is probably less impatient than I am. I would love to get there faster, but it is the nature of this job and the nature of history that sometimes things take longer than we would like. You have nine-hundred or so days left. Good luck. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

{"id": 498, "text": "ENTITY, thank you so much for your time in this interview with Radio Farda. On the beginning of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, what message do you wish to share with the people of Iran, especially with the Iranian women, as well as the young generation? First, that the United States of America wishes everybody a happy New Year. Secondly, that the United States people of the United States respects the great Iranian history and culture. We have great respect for the people. And we have got problems with the Government. We have problems with the Government because the Government has been threatening, has made decisions that and statements that really have isolated the people of Iran. My message to the young in Iran is that someday your society will be free, and it will be a blessed time for you. My message to the women of Iran is that the women of America share your deep desire for children to be to grow up in a hopeful society and to live in peace. Speaking of women of Iran, ENTITY, the majority of population in Iran are women. And even in the Iranian culture they are considered the foundation on which men deeply rely. Is there any plan or could there be one to promote and engage the Iranian women in the U.S. to a unified and centralized movement for a free and democratic Iran? Well, I think the people of Iran are going to have to come to the conclusion that a free country is in their interest. We, of course, support freedom movements all around the world. We are supporting a freedom movement on the Iranian border in Iraq. We are promoting and helping the Iraqis develop a free society. By the way, a free Iraq will help the Iranians see the blessings of a free society. There is no doubt in my mind that the women will be leading freedom movements in Iran and elsewhere. And the role of the United States is to provide, you know, moral support without and other support without undermining their cause. ENTITY, in this fifth anniversary of the Iraq war, what impact do you think a peaceful solution on the Iranian nuclear crisis and a normalization of our relations with Iran would have on the security and political situation in Iraq and more generally in the whole Middle East? I think that success in Iraq will first of all depend upon the Iraqis' desire to reconcile their differences and to live in peace, and that is happening. It is hard work to overcome the a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's, but nevertheless, most Iraqis want to live in peace with their neighbor. Secondly, a peaceful Iraq will depend upon making it clear to the Iranians to stop exporting weapons from Iran into Iraq that arm militias and arm criminal gangs that cause there to be harm for the innocent people. Thirdly, it is very important for the neighborhood to understand that the United States is committed to peace and that we are not that we will not be run out because of violence; that we believe that we are there for the right reason, which is to promote freedom and peace. The free you know, there is a chance that the U.S. and Iran can reconcile their differences, but the Government is going to have to make some make different choices. And one is to verifiably suspend the enrichment of uranium, at which time there is a way forward. And the Iranian people have got to understand that the United States is going to be firm in our desire to prevent the nation from developing a nuclear weapon, but reasonable in our desire to see to it that you have civilian nuclear power without you know, without enabling the Government to enrich. And the problem is, is that they have not told the truth in the past. And therefore, it is very difficult for the United States and the rest of the world or much of the rest of the world to trust the Iranian Government when it comes to telling the truth. And so I support the Russian proposal to provide Iran with enriched uranium to go into a civilian nuclear power plant. There is a way forward. In other words, I do not know what the Iranian people believe about the United States, but they must believe that we have proposed a way forward that will yield to peace. And it is their Government that is resisting these changes. ENTITY, as you and your allies launched a global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism, what do you think is your most important challenge to expose and stop the secretive ambition of Iran's Government to enrich uranium, while assuring its citizens that their happiness and prosperity and peace is a benefit within their reach? Sure, absolutely. Well, one thing is, is to reiterate my belief that the Iranians should have a civilian nuclear power program. It is in their right to have it. The problem is the Government cannot be trusted to enrich uranium because, one, they have hidden programs in the past, and they may be hiding one now, who knows; and secondly, they have declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people some in the Middle East. And that is unacceptable to the United States, and it is unacceptable to the world. But what is acceptable to me is to work with a nation like Russia to provide the fuel so that the plan can go forward, and which therefore makes it you know, it shows that the Iranian Government does not need to learn to enrich. My only point to the Iranian people is we want you to be able to realize your sovereign rights. The Government has been duplicitous to the world. Very few people trust your Government. And if the Government changes its behavior, there is a better way forward for the Iranian people. Thank you. ENTITY, world democracy is everyone's rightful way of life. In Iran, on the other hand, there is no respect for the basic rights of Iranian citizen; there is no rule of law; and there is no, certainly, the freedom of speech. Do you believe that the people of Iran stand a chance against this regime, to bring about the positive change in anytime soon with your support? Well, I would like very much for the Iranian people to realize a society based upon rule of law and free speech and free worship of religion. There is nothing I'd like to see more than a society in which young girls can grow up to realize their dreams with a good education system. You know, this is a this regime, however, is one that sometimes when people express themselves in an open way, there can be serious punishment. This is a regime that says they have elections, but they get to decide who is on the ballot, which is not a free and fair election. So this is a regime and a society that is got a long way to go. But the people of Iran can be rest assured the United States, whether I am ENTITY or the next ENTITY, will strongly support their desires to live in a free society. May I have, ENTITY, my last question? Yes. Thank you. You said many times that the U.S. missile defense system in Czech and Poland is to defend America and its European allies from attack by rogue states such as Iran. But some this argument is still between U.S. and Russia. Are you optimistic to solve the problem? Well, it is interesting you ask that question. We intend to move forward with the and the Czech Republic and Poland, for the good of NATO. Obviously, it'd be make life easier if the Russians and the United States cooperated in such a missile defense. Condi Rice and Bob Gates Secretary Gates, Secretary Rice were in Russia this past couple of days talking about the very subject, as to whether or not we can find grounds to cooperate. The missile systems, defense systems, would not be aimed at Russia; they'd be aimed at nations that would, you know, try to hold the free world hostage with a nuclear weapon. And so it is I am optimistic. I am cautiously optimistic. I do not know whether we can find common ground. But we are trying to find common ground, and that is what is that is the first step, is to make the attempt. Thank you so much, ENTITY, for your time. Yes, ma'am, thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithparichehrfarzamradiofarda", "title": "Interview With Parichehr Farzam of Radio Farda", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-parichehr-farzam-radio-farda", "publication_date": "19-03-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 87, "text": "Good morning, ENTITY. Good morning, ENTITY. I suppose those scenes of Mass. General look pretty familiar to you? You have been on the board of overseers since 1947, I believe? Yes, that is right. I must say that I think the work that Massachusetts General does and other similar hospitals around the country, they perform a great public function. And to think that this hospital is celebrating its 150th anniversary. It was begun the year before the war of 1812, and yet there are two other American hospitals that are even older. When we think of the tremendous progress that has been made in medicine, yet even way back then, fellow citizens were concerned about caring for their neighbors--and the Massachusetts General does more than care for the people of that area. There are over a thousand students studying in various parts of the hospital from all over the world, and the influence of Massachusetts General stretches really around the globe through the work of these graduates. They have put out, I think, $4 million a year, in this one hospital, into research. Is this enough, I wonder? Are we doing enough generally for research in this country? I think we can always do better. My family has been particularly interested in one kind of research, and we now have at the hospital a center for research into the causes of mental retardation of children. This center is going to begin building as soon as the snow is off the ground. I think this is one area where there has been inadequate research. We are fortunate in this case to have a close connection with Harvard University. Dr. Adams from Harvard University is heading the research center. But I do believe that nearly every American family either has some member of its family or some friend who goes through the very harrowing experience of having a child in the family who suffers from mental retardation--the difficulties that the child has and the difficulty that it causes in the family. I think that rather than caring for these children, which we are attempting to do, though not always adequately, I think it is most important that we try to examine why they are retarded and what could be done about it--whether through surgery or other treatment we could begin to cure them, not merely care for them. Will eventually we cure everybody, do you think? Will the health of the Nation approach perfection some day, by care and research? No, I suppose we are all-we may stretch out our period on this earth but sooner or later we will all begin to--but at least what I think we are all concerned about is that children have a happy childhood, and a fruitful one; and that adults be permitted to work and that older people find their later years to be easier, free from pain and discomfort; and then I think everybody will await their end, but I think there is an awful lot we can do. And the cooperation between medicine, between private individuals who supported Massachusetts General, and between the National Government in providing funds for research, it is a happy relationship, though one that can always be improved. Do we recognize the importance--I read your article recently, on the subject of physical fitness in this country-for the young and middle aged too? Well, I think it is a serious problem. Our society is quite sophisticated and we are in a very dangerous period in our world history. We have unrelenting foes who are determined to destroy us. Physical fitness goes with mental fitness. It goes with energy--and I am concerned that recent tests have shown a steady decline in the standards of American fitness as compared with European and people around the world. In reading a recent article on guerrilla warfare, I noticed the great emphasis put on physical fitness. We are in a dangerous period, and I think that we have to be fit. Now it is harder, because our life is easier--we have cars, buses, and all the rest. I think we ought to concern ourselves with making sure that our children are fit, that they are concerned with being energetic--that they use their young years not merely as spectators but as participants in life. Will you help us to wake up? Well, we are trying. I think that this is a great country, and I think it deserves the best of all of us. I think that physical fitness is a part of our survival, and I am hopeful that we can, through the White House--but really it is a private decision--but at least from this area we are going to try to do our best to emphasize this. It is really up to every parent. Do your children go every week and watch a basketball game, or do they do something to make themselves fit? I think we are inclined to think that if we watch a football game or a baseball game, that we have taken part in it. That is not what we want. Well, you do not usually get into this posture of sitting down very much, I understand. You are more than busy I must say that this hospital is a--I am delighted to have this rather long-distance connection with this hospital. It emphasizes not only what this hospital does, but all the hospitals in your community. They all deserve our support. And I am delighted to have this chance, through ENTITY, to emphasize our great national interest in developing our hospitals, developing research, training doctors, training nurses--and spreading the benefits of modern medicine through this country and around the world.

{"id": 80, "text": "ENTITY, this week in Prague, NATO will invite seven countries to join the Alliance. But there are other topics on the agenda, and the future of NATO is one of them. What do you see NATO will be doing in the 21st century? What is its role? Well, I think-first of all, I am excited about going to Prague, and I want to thank the citizens of that important city and the great country for their hard work in recovering from the floods and preparing Prague for our arrival. This is going to be a historic meeting because, as you said, we are expanding NATO. The most important alliance America has is NATO, and the expansion of NATO is something that I think is very important. The role of NATO is different as we go into the 21st century. NATO used to be a way to defend Europe from the Warsaw Pact. But the Warsaw Pact no longer exists. Russia is not an enemy. And we face new threats, and the new threats are global terror. And so one way to make sure NATO is relevant is to focus on the true threats to freedom, address those threats, and figure out ways that we can work together to accomplish what we want, which is a peaceful world, which means better intelligence-sharing, the capacity to cut off money, and a military operation that reflects the nature of the wars we will be fighting. And that is going to be one of the most important discussions we face there in Prague. Well, there are really big gaps between the war-fighting capabilities of NATO-of the United States, on one hand, and the European countries, on the other hand. And Lord Robertson is saying that the Americans are not always willing to share the technology necessary for NATO. Are you ready to participate on organization of European forces? Well, I think what has to happen is there first be a strategy that recognizes that the Czech Republic can provide a certain contribution or the French or the British-not the French but the Germans or the British can provide certain kind of capabilities-and that we dovetail each capability to an overall strategy. In which case, of course, America is willing to work with our friends and allies to make sure the NATO Alliance works properly. In other words, everybody can contribute something. But it all has got to be done within the strategy of the true threats we face in the 21st century, which is global terrorism. That is the biggest threat to freedom right now. You will certainly talk about Iraq. Will the United States, if it decides to go to war with Iraq, seek the support of NATO as an alliance? Well, first, I hope we do not have to go to war with Iraq. I mean, my first choice is not to commit our troops to regime change. I hope that Saddam Hussein does what he said he would do, and that is disarm. For the sake of peace, he must disarm. Most nations understand that-most nations in NATO understand that. They want Saddam to disarm. The U.N. Security Council has spoken and says he must disarm. So it is his choice to make. If he refuses to disarm, then we will lead a coalition of the willing and disarm him. And of course, I hope our NATO friends come with us. I think they will realize it is in the interest of peace and stability that that happen. But we are not close to that decision point yet because we are just beginning the process of allowing Saddam the chance to show the world whether or not he will disarm. And that is an important distinction the people of the Czech Republic must know. It is not up to me. It is up to him. He said he would disarm, and the inspectors are not the issue. The inspectors are simply a means to determine his willingness. And we will see. He is had a bad history. He is had 11 years of lying and deceiving, and now it is time to bring him to account, one way or the other. Some critics now see NATO as a toolbox, and the United States just goes and picks whatever it needs when it needs it. Do you agree? No, of course not. I mean, I think we view this as an alliance of nations with whom we share common values, the common values of freedom and individual rights and democracy. This is an opportunity for us to combine our values with our deep desire to have a peaceful world. And we will work in concert with each other, not in opposition to each other. And by working in concert we can really address those threats. See, that is the interesting thing that people have got to know. There is threats to your freedom. If you embrace freedom and love freedom and willing to stand strong against global terrorism, you will be threatened. And we cannot let that happen. It is just a different type of threat that we face, but it is a true threat. We face it here in America today. There is still an enemy that wants to hit us. There is still an enemy that wants to hit our friends. And the NATO Charter says, If you attack one, you attack us all. And that is a very important alliance, a very important statement of commonality to keep the peace. I think NATO is a good thing, and I look forward to working with our friends in NATO.

{"id": 246, "text": "ENTITY, good to talk to you again, sir. Great to talk to you, ENTITY. On the theory that the TPP is a legacy thing for you, right, along with the Affordable Care Act and the stimulus program from what seems like a really long time ago now, how involved were you with this thing at the very end? Were you making phone calls? Were you working other leaders? Yes, and the reason is not because it is a legacy item for me. Because it is a legacy item for America. Keep in mind ENTITY that we started this five years ago, with the basic proposition that the Asia-Pacific region is the most populous, fastest-growing region in the world. Mmhm And since 95 percent of the world's market is outside our borders, we have got to make sure that we are selling in other countries' goods made in America and services designed and produced here in the United States. And so we gathered together these 11 countries. It was a very difficult, contentious negotiation. Our team did a great job. At the very end you always have a few things that you have just got to get over the hump. And so yes, I made calls to prime ministers, I made calls to presidents, I made calls to U.S. businesses, I made calls to a lot of stakeholders, environmental groups, to explain to them why it is so important for us to make sure that we have got a high-standard set of rules governing trade and commerce in this region. Because if we do not set those standards, if we do not have strong labor standards, environmental standards, transparency, making sure that our companies are being treated fairly, if we do not set them, then China will set them, and our businesses and our workers will be disadvantaged, so we put a lot of effort into this thing. Now our goal is to make sure that everybody here in the United States is informed about it. We will be posting every dotted I and crossed T on a website. And Congress and the American public and all the constituencies that are interested are going to be able to review this thing and see that in fact this is the most progressive, high-standard trade deal ever crafted. When are you going to post it? Soon? Soon. Since you mentioned China, last time you and I spoke, you said that they had reached out. I am assuming you spoke with President Xi about this when he was in town 10 days, two weeks ago. Where are they on the list of countries No. 13 through 15 looking to join this thing? Here is what I am confident about. We get this ratified and we start implementing, we will strengthen the hand of reformers inside of China who recognize that the model that they have been operating under is not going to work forever. Part of what is happening in China right now is that they have an old-style model of cheap labor, exporting manufacturing goods, not a lot of high-value-added, not a lot, a big, strong domestic market. If they are going to sustain the growth that they have had over the last 20 years, if they hope to match the growth levels that they have seen, they have got to open up their markets, they have got to provide protection for patents and intellectual property, they have got to end the subsidies to these state-owned enterprises. So there are a lot of things that they are going to have to do. And if they see that all their neighbors are operating at a high level, then I am confident that ultimately they will adapt to the rules that we have set up as opposed to us adapting or being locked out of these markets because they have set rules that advantage the old style of doing business. Seems to me a little bit like you are betting on the come on this one, right? Because as we have seen the past four months, the Chinese are not afraid to get their hands in there and mess around with their own economic gears, right? With currency manipulation, with trying to prop up their stock market. Currency manipulation, in fact, was a big point of contention between you and the Congress when you were negotiating fast track on this one. What do the Chinese have to do that will prove to you they are going to do this because- Well, keep in mind, ENTITY, if you look at the data, the peak of Chinese currency manipulation was taking place 10 years ago, five years ago, 15 years ago. Right now, actually, the most recent intervention they did in the markets probably propped up the RMB - their currency. It'd probably be even lower had they not intervened. But it scared the bejesus out of everybody. Well, it did, and I think it also concerned President Xi, recognizing that you cannot - in an interconnected global economy - continue to operate at the scale they are operating with old rules that maybe applied when they were a backwater economy. Now, they are a major player and a major engine of economic growth, and they have got to be more transparent, more professional, more in sync with best practices. That, I think is going to help. When it comes to currency manipulation, one of the things we have in the Trans-Pacific Partnership - and this is the first time we have been able to get all these countries to agree on it - there are a set of principles in terms of how you measure and what constitutes currency manipulation. Now it is not an enforceable provision in the same way that for example, violations of labor standards or environmental standards will be, but keep in mind that when it comes to setting up these trade rules internationally, our goal is constantly to raise the bar, and you are never going to get 100 percent of what you want right away. As a consequence of this deal, Vietnam is not going to suddenly have U.S. labor standards. On the other hand, by us for the first time getting Vietnam to agree that they have to prohibit child labor, they have to prohibit forced labor, they have to allow for unions to be able to form inside of Vietnam - that introduces a principle inside their economy that will ultimately not only make workers in Vietnam benefit, but it is going to be good for our workers because they are not going to be competing against child labor or forced labor. And that is enforceable. NAFTA labor provisions were not enforceable. We raised the bar. The same is going to be true with currency. Over time, what you do is you keep on chipping away at this thing until you get a high-standard deal for everybody that is creating the kind of level playing field that allows American businesses to succeed. Let us talk about the impact back home for a minute. I get that if I am Big Pharma or if I am a dairy farmer in this country, this deal has immediate ramifications for me. But if I am just some person out there in the regular economy, how am I going to see this? What is it going to mean to me? Well, here is what it is going to mean: If you have eliminated 18,000 taxes that other countries in this region effectively place on U.S. goods and services when we try to sell there - so it makes them more expensive and it makes them less attractive - if we eliminate those taxes, now U.S. goods and services are more competitive. That means we are selling more. If U.S. companies are selling more to these countries, then that means that those companies can hire more people and put more people to work. And by the way, if we are able to reduce these tariffs, these taxes that are imposed, it means that companies who might have been thinking, you know what, if we want to access the Vietnam market, we have got to produce in Vietnam. Now they are saying to themselves, You know what, we can produce here in the United States, we do not have to offshore, we do not have to ship out. Instead, we can make things here and sell them there, and we know that we are going to be able to have access to those markets. And keep in mind that a lot of people say, Oh, it is the big corporations that are all benefiting from this. Companies like a Boeing or a GE, they have got supplier chains that go from Maine to California. They have got companies that may only have 50 employees that produce one particular part. You have got wine growers in Oregon, you have got tea producers, small internet companies and small businesses that are producing for export today, partly because it is powered by the internet. In fact, this trade agreement for the first time has an entire chapter just devoted to making sure that small businesses have access to these export markets, not just the big companies. Let me ask you a question about individuals in this economy. We have been doing some economic polling. It is going to be out in a couple of weeks. What we are finding is a tremendous sense of people being stuck, of economic anxiety. And that is not to say that this is jobless recovery, because as we know and as you know, jobs are coming back in this country. Right. What we have here though is a wageless recovery Yes. 'Cause they are going nowhere. Yeah. The question then is, is that the new normal? Should we just get used to that? No, I think we should not get used to it. And I think there is some very specific things we can do to finally start seeing more accelerated wage growth to match the job growth, and I have talked about some of these things before. Raising the minimum wage makes a difference for millions of workers, making sure that we have a tax code that does not incentivize short-term thinking on the part of companies and quarterly reports but instead gives them incentive to invest in their workers and make sure that they are being treated fairly. That can make a difference. Making sure that we are investing in the continuing education and training of our workers, so that they have more skills and that means that they can get higher wages. That makes a difference. Making sure that we have the laws that allow collective bargaining and unions. That makes a difference. So part of what is happened when it comes to wages as opposed to job creation is that as a consequence of globalization but also because of automation and technology, increasingly workers have had less leverage. And so even if the jobs are being created, companies do not feel obliged to give people raises as demand for their products go up. They can say to themselves, You know what, we will just invest in more automation instead of hiring more workers, or if we do hire more workers, we will tell them,'This is how much we can afford, and if you want more, then we know that there is a bunch of other people that we can get.' And we have to make sure that the middle class and workers have more leverage and the laws that we set up in this country can make a difference. And here is what we know. There are countries like Germany where wages typically are higher but they are still competitive, and it has to do with the arrangements they make and how big of the pie that is growing goes to middle-class families and workers as opposed to just shareholders and financial firms. Last time we talked, I pushed you a little bit on how jobs inevitably when trade agreements get done, they inevitably go away, and nobody who is in favor of free trade ever says, You know what, you are going to lose some jobs, get used to it. And you pushed back a little bit. Do you think people believe you when you say this will be good for us? Do you think my 17-year-old can believe you that in 20 years, this is going to wind up being a net positive? I think the starting point is skepticism when it comes to trade, because the story that people associate with trade - the story I associate with trade, I mean, remember I am a progressive Democrat who came out of a - I remember. - manufacturing state and saw plants close down in small towns, and people who had worked there all their lives suddenly are left in the lurch. So I have seen the negative effects of trade, but the argument that I have made, and I make this especially to my union friends because they support me on everything else but on this one - Yeah, they talking to you on this one? - we have a difference. What I have said to them is that companies in the United States who are pursuing a low-wage strategy and have decided that the way for us to compete and make a profit is to find the lowest wages possible, they have already left. They are already gone. And the question now becomes, how do we position ourselves so that we do not lose in the future? This trade deal does not make up for all the offshoring that is happened over the last 20, 30 years. I am the first one to acknowledge that. But I can tell you that under my administration, manufacturing has grown faster than any time since the 1990s. And that is not just autos, that is across sectors. And part of the reason is because there are some things we have done to make ourselves more competitive, and we have also made sure that other countries are not taking advantage of us as much when it comes to the rules of the road. This is part of that overall strategy. We are not going to bring back all the manufacturing jobs that were lost. The economy is dynamic and is changing. More of it is in the service sector than it used to be. Unions have become weaker, and, frankly, companies have moved to a much more short-term approach to quarterly profits as opposed to long-term investment. All those trends have conspired to make it tougher on a lot of middle-class families, and the way to reverse that is to invest in education, invest in things like infrastructure that cannot be exported, train our workers so that they continue to be the best in the world, make sure we are investing in research and development so that we can continue to innovate. And part of that is also making sure that we have access to markets and a reciprocal system of trade so that, since these folks are all selling to us, we better be darn sure that we are selling to them. And if you are fighting the last war, which typically happens in these debates, where people say, Well, look at what happened with NAFTA. What I say to them is, Well, we should have learned some lessons from NAFTA, and in fact that is what we have done, which is why now we have enforceable environmental provisions and enforceable labor provisions. And as I said before, Vietnam is not going to suddenly have the same standards that we do. Malaysia is not going to suddenly enforce environmental provisions exactly the way we do, but we will have raised the bar for them, and if in fact they have these higher standards, which means that they have responsibilities and costs for operating in those countries that are higher than they currently are, then I am confident that we can compete and we will continue to see insourcing of jobs moving here, moving back. What we cannot do is think that somehow, if we draw a moat around this country, that we are going to be able to avoid globalization and technology, because frankly when you look at job loss and lost leverage, automation and technology has probably contributed more than trade has to that problem. The anxieties are real, the concerns are real, but the prescription is not for us to try to look backwards. The prescription here is for us to look forward, and that is what this trade deal does. ENTITY, thanks very much for your time, sir. Great to talk to you, ENTITY. Thank you, always a pleasure.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithkairyssdalthemarketplace", "title": "Interview with Kai Ryssdal of The Marketplace", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-kai-ryssdal-the-marketplace", "publication_date": "06-10-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 59, "text": "Quick statement-I will be glad to answer questions. I am really looking forward to my trip. It is the first trip to India for me and my wife. We had a great dinner here with the Prime Minister. I found him to be a very decent, honorable person with whom we established warm relations. And he-I just cannot tell you how- what a kind person he was and, at the same time, represented his great country's interests very well. I do want to make something clear in the speech I gave today. I said that-as to the Kashmir interest-issue, America supports a solution that is acceptable to all sides. As you might recall, in my remarks, I said, to both sides. I would like the record to be so that the world hears me say, all sides. I fully understand that the deal has to be acceptable to the Indians, Paks, as well as the citizens of Kashmir. Okay? Yes. ENTITY, how and why has India come front and center to U.S. strategic thinking now after being on the margins for so many years? Well, as you know, there was a history, particularly during the cold war, that made it difficult for our countries to establish a close relationship. However, things change in the world. And as the post-cold war thaw developed, as-attitudes began to shift. Secondly, the Indian economy, as a result of more transparency and openness and trade, began to change. And as the Indian economy changed, it changed the commercial relationship between the United States and India. Thirdly, there are some common threats that make it in our interests to work to-gether-namely terrorism. As I said in my speech today, the United States has been attacked, but India certainly understands what it means to have suffering as a result of terrorist activities. And so there is common interests that have helped to change the relationship. And I intend to seize those interests, as does the Prime Minister, in order to foster what we have called a strategic relationship. And in my speech today, I made it clear to the American people that this relationship is in our interests, and I described the various ways it was in our interests. I think the evolution of the relationship goes to show that the world is-changes, and it is never static. And so thank you for the question. ENTITY, if India's credentials are so good, why is not the U.S. backing its candidacy for the U.N. Security Council? Well, let me make one other point, if you do not mind, that I should have made in my speech today, and that is that there are a lot of Indian Americans who made a tremendous contribution to our country as well. And there are a lot of-over the last-as the high-tech boom helped transform our society, a lot of the brain power behind that boom have been Indian Americans, as well as Indians educated here in America. And so the American people, as well, have begun to get kind of a different perspective on the great contributions that India can not only make to our own country but can make to the world. Our position on the United Nations Security Council has been very clear. First, we support a U.N. Security Council reform, but we think it ought to happen after other institutions within the United Nations become reformed. What I was always worried about is that we would focus on the U.N. Security Council and nothing else would happen. And so we have-we have said to all parties concerned-I fully understand the Indian position just like other nations- that we will take your case under consideration, but first things first. And a classic case of the reform I am talking about is the Human Rights Commission. It needed to be reformed. And what I was, again, worried about is that we'd miss opportunity while focusing on the U.N. Security Council. ENTITY, when do you intend to take the U.S.-India nuclear deal before the Congress and before the Nuclear Supplies Group, which is part of the U.S. obligation? Yes, it is. As we speak, Nick Burns of the State Department is discussing this vital issue with Indian counterparts. We are working through what has been-as I said in the speech, a difficult issue for the Indian Government as well for the American Government. To change the past, the ways of the past, can be difficult at times. I appreciate the Prime Minister's courage last July of laying out a way forward, which I support. And so first things first is to go to India and, hopefully, reach an agreement on separation and then bring that agreement back and start selling it to the Congress. It is -but we cannot bring anything back until we have agreed to the agreement. And that is what is happening now. There is a spirit of good will and cooperation. It is in our country's interest, by the way, to encourage India and aid India in its development of a civilian nuclear power program. The American people are beginning to see high prices of energy, but so are the Indian people. And the reason why is, is that there is growing economies-ours, India's, China's-which is adding to global demand for energy. And demand is outstripping supply, and then what happens, you see price. And one way to help deal with price here at home and/or with India is to develop alternative ways to power homes and businesses as well as automobiles. I was sincere in my speech today when I said that we are dedicated to research and development to come up with alternative ways to use automobiles and want to share that technologies with other nations, particularly a nation like India, which has got huge potential and vast room for growth. And it is in our mutual interests-I also made it clear that it is in our interests that the Indian economy prosper. And it is a very simple reason why. One, a prosperous country is one that is-particularly one that has shown its capacity to deal with a multi-ethnic and multireligious society-it will give India more opportunity to lead, particularly in parts of the world where people need to see how democracy can work and function in a proper way. And secondly, the American people have got to understand a prosperous India is advantageous to our own industries. I mean, we want people buying American products. Indians want Americans buying Indian products. And that exchange of trade in a free and fair way is beneficial for workers and consumers. And I said an amazing statistic today- at least I thought it was-300 million mid-dle-class citizens in India. That is larger than the population of the United States. And so we should not fear relations with India- matter of fact, we ought to welcome them and work on ways to strengthen them. That is really what the purpose of the trip is. Do you consider India to be a responsible nuclear nation? I do, particularly when they signed the IAEA safeguards, and they have a separation between their military and their civilian nuclear parts of their Government. ENTITY, would the United States have a problem if India continued to source oil and gas from Iran? I think people are going to have to buy their energy where they can get it. On the other hand, I do want to make it clear to the Indian people and the Indian Government that an Iran with a nuclear weapon will destabilize the world and that those of us who are for peace and stability must work in concert. So there is a difference between energy supply and working closely to achieve a very important objective. And we will discuss this issue carefully with the Prime Minister. There is a consensus in the world, and that consensus is that an Iranian Government that has declared its-has said that Israel should not exist, for example, and if it were to have a nuclear weapon, would be a danger to all of us. And I will continue to make that point with the Prime Minister. Why has the U.S. not questioned Khan, whose activities intersect proliferation and terrorism? Well, we were the nation that exposed the conspiracy to deal with- more than the conspiracy, the activities; let me rephrase that-we were the nation that exposed the activities of sharing technologies, sensitive technologies, nuclear weapons-related technologies. And we, of course, want to know as much about the Khan network as possible. But had it not been for U.S. intelligence, coupled with British intelligence, this network never would have been exposed. And the light of day helps understand proliferation. ENTITY, why does India have to jump through the hoops to get a civilian nuclear agreement when its energy requirements are similar to China, another big, growing economy? There are the nuclear supplier group and the IAEA-in other words, the world has signed on to this. We think it is in India's interest to do so, as it pertains to its civilian nuclear power industry. It will give confidence to people. It will make it easier for the United States to work with India. This will be a confidence-building measure that we do not believe is an unrealistic request. And we do realize there will be separation between the military side and the civilian side. What we are working on is the civilian side. Is the U.S. more comfortable dealing with dictators and monarchs? Do what now? Do I feel comfortable doing what? Dealing with dictators and monarchs? Do I feel comfortable dealing with them? No, the U.S. The U.S. feel comfortable with dealing with dictators? And monarchs. And monarchs? Well, I mean, I have got a great relationship with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain. She is a lovely lady and a great figure in a country that is an important ally. And of course, that monarchy is very supportive of a free and open and democratic system. You must take the words that I said in my second Inaugural Address very seriously, in that we must end tyranny in the 21st century. It is a goal that all of us can work on. India has got a unique role to play. I mean, when you really think about troubled spots, these are countries many times that are having difficulty dealing with what it means to honor minority rights and welcoming different religions within, kind of, a social and civil fabric. And India has done a magnificent job of showing the world how democracy can work. And it is -India is-I am confident the country will play a constructive role and can do so in a much better way-many times-than the United States can. I mean, after all, there are 150 * Muslims living within the Indian democracy. We got a lot of Muslims in the United States, as well, which shows the world that it is - you are capable of honoring-worshiping God as you see fit, and you can do so in a free way and, at the same time, be a productive citizen of a state. And India can help a lot. I was very impressed by its contribution to a new democracy in the neighborhood, and that is Afghanistan. India has provided $565 million of cash, recently pledged an additional $50 million to build the Afghan National Assembly building. And that is responsible- a responsible nation does that. And it is a- it goes to show-at least says to me that India understands that a democracy in our neighborhood will help yield peace, because if you study the history of the world, regions that had been in turmoil are now peaceful as a result of the evolution of democracy. And one of the points I made in my address to the Asia Society is that there are-there is more democracies now in the region, which will make it easier for a current Prime Minister, future Prime Minister of India to help achieve the vision that we all want, which is a peaceful world. India-U.S. Relations ENTITY, in this era of free-flow capital, why would-why are there so many restrictions about inflow of talent- human capital to the United States, who probably add wealth and knowledge-- I appreciate that question. I am-you are talking about visa restrictions for highly educated citizens. I am for lifting those. I think we ought to raise the level of those who are either educated here and stay here and/or come meeting high-with high skill levels. It is in our interest. I have always been a proponent of that. And likewise, I would hope that India would lift its investment caps. In other words-and part of the trip is to kind of work on ways to continue to develop this strategic relationship in a constructive way. It is a-you know, I said something interesting-at least I thought it was interesting-in the speech. I said, for a period of time, if you are a friend of Pakistan, you could not deal with India, and if you are a friend of India, you could not deal with Pakistan. And we have tried to change the relationships so that people recognize it is in their interest that the United States is a friend of Pakistan's, and people in Pakistan recognize it is in their interest that the United States is a friend of India's to help, if need be, reduce tensions. Right now the level of tensions are, relatively speaking, down. I can remember when I first came into office. You might remember, there was a series of incidents that got everybody quite nervous, and we had shuttle diplomacy-Colin Powell. And it seems to me that there is a renewed commitment to resolving problems. I thought it was very interesting that trade between the two countries has doubled, that there is , you know, new transportation hubs. That is all very positive in terms of resolving issues. You asked me about the relationship, how it is evolved, and I mentioned to you that as time passes sometimes and circumstances change, relationships are able to develop a new dynamic. I would hope that time and circumstantial change is enabling India and Pakistan to develop a new dynamic. It appears to be that way. Between a cricket match and a Bollywood movie, what would a-- Cricket match and a-- You like watching? What was the second? It is between a Bollywood movie and a cricket match. I am a cricket match person. I appreciate it. As I understand it, I may have a little chance to learn something about cricket. It is a great pastime. But, ENTITY, you are going to India, but you are not visiting the Taj Mahal. I know. It means I am going to have to-- Have you broken a promise to the First Lady? No, it means I am going to have to come back. It is a-I am disappointed with that. People who have seen the Taj Mahal say that it is -pictures do not do it justice. It is one of the great magnificent sites of the world. And look, if I were the scheduler, perhaps I'd be doing things differently. But you want me doing one thing. I will be the President; we have got the scheduler being the scheduler. I am going to miss a lot of the really interesting parts of your great country; I know that. I would hope that I would be invited back sometime after this trip. You could be in trouble with the Desperate Housewife. Yes. Well, she is certainly the star of the family. She is really looking forward to going with me. ENTITY, what is your earliest memory of India? Press Secretary Scott McClellan. We have got to go to the next one. What is your earliest memory of India and Indians? My best memory? Earliest. At least memory? Press Secretary McClellan. Earliest. Earliest. Earliest. Gandhi. It is my first memory, as I think about India-you know, a person who was so spiritual that he captured the imagination of the entire world. He is proof positive that-throughout history there have been individuals that have had the capacity to shape thought and to influence and-beyond border. And he did that. You watched the movie? I watched that too. But that is -but my memory was earlier than that. Thank you. Thank you very much.

{"id": 245, "text": "Have you ever been in the Oval Office before? Once, a long time ago I will give you a quick tour before our interview. So the first thing that a ENTITY does, which I did not realize, was pick a rug. I have have no idea about rugs. And so in this job, you have got to delegate. The ENTITY is in a position where there is just unbelievable complexities to the job-Darfur, Iran-a whole lot of issues. So I delegated the decision about the rug to my wife. The second thing a ENTITY has got to do is have a strategic mind. In order to be successful, in my judgment, as the ENTITY, you have got to constantly think strategically. And so I said to her, You pick out the colors; you be the tactical person; but I want it to say, 'optimistic person. ' That is all I wanted it to say. Here is the result. Is not it beautiful? Yes, it is very beautiful. There is a sense of optimism when you come in here. And there is a reason why. You cannot lead people unless you are optimistic about what you are doing. You have got to believe it in your very soul. One of the interesting things about the Presidency is people watch me like a hawk. They are looking at my moves. And if I am going to be wringing my hands and if I am all worried about the decisions I make-are not going to lead to a better tomorrow, they will figure it out. And so when you talk to me today, I just want you to know, I not only strongly believe in the decisions I make, I am optimistic that they are going to work-very optimistic. These are all Texas paintings. That is west Texas; those are other Texas paintings. At least if you are a Texan, it reflects a way of life and a way of thinking. The interesting thing about Washington is that they want me to change- they being the- and I am not changing, you know. You cannot make decisions if you do not know who you are and you flip around with the politics. You have got to stay strong in what you believe and optimistic about that-you will get good results. And so-the other thing I want you to know about me is that no matter how pressurized it may seem, I am not changing what I believe. Now, I may change tactics, but I am not going to change my core beliefs- a belief that freedom is universal or the belief that private markets work, a belief in ownership-when people own something, society is better off; a belief that there is a role for government, but it is limited in nature. And I am not changing. I do not care whether they like me at the cocktail parties or not. I want to be able to leave this office with my integrity intact. That is George Washington, the first President, of course. The interesting thing about him is that I read three-three or four books about him last year. Is not that interesting? People say, So what? Well, here is the so what. You never know what your history is going to be like until long after you are gone-if they are still analyzing the Presidency of George Washington- . So Presidents should not worry about the history. You just cannot . You do what you think is right, and if you are thinking big enough, that history will eventually prove you right or wrong. But you will not know in the short term. Lincoln-this is the place on the Oval Office wall where the President puts the most-the best President, and I put Lincoln here, and I do not think there is any question-now, people will have their-but I think he was the most influential President ever. And the reason why is because that in the midst of a difficult Presidency, needless to say-the Civil War, thousands of people dying, with Americans killing Americans-he had a vision of a United States. It is conceivable this country would have ended up being two countries had he not had a clear vision, even though all around him was seemingly falling apart. He was a great President. That is called A Charge to Keep, based upon a religious hymn. The hymn talks about serving God. The President's job is never to promote a religion. The great thing about America-and Germany, for that matter-is that you should be able to worship freely. I like to tell people, you are equally American whether you are a Jew, Muslim, Christian, or atheist-you are equally all Americans-and that if we ever lose that, we begin to look like the Taliban. I understand, in parts of Europe, some scoff at my faith. It does not bother me. But I happen to believe, for me at least, faith is one way to make sure that my values stay intact and that I keep life in proper perspective, which is a very important part, in my judgment, of being a good decisionmaker. Finally, the desk, where we will have our picture taken in front of is-nine other Presidents used it. This was given to us by Queen Victoria in the 1870s, I think it was. President Roosevelt put the door in so people would not know he was in a wheelchair. John Kennedy put his head out the door. Yes, the very famous picture-- That is it-the most famous picture. And then Reagan, interestingly enough, put the bottom on there. He was a big guy; he did not want to bump his knees under the desk. Anyway, this is the Oval Office. It is a shrine to democracy. And we treat it that way. When people walk in here, they do not come in here in bathing suits and flip-flops. They come in here dressed like they'd come to a shrine. It is to be respected and honored because the Office of the President is bigger than the person who occupies it. It is one of the great things about a true democracy, is that the institutions outlast the individuals, and therefore, there is stability in the process. Some Presidents forget that they are not bigger than the Office. But all Presidents must always honor the Office and remember it is a sacred trust to uphold the honor of the Presidency. Thank you for taking the time. Yes, glad to do it. Bild has 12 million readers. It is the largest newspaper in Germany. And there is one thing which is really special about our newspaper-every German who wants to work for the newspaper, he has to sign in his working contracts some beliefs-and there is the belief you have to be for reunification; you have to be against totalitarianism from riots on the right side and the left side; and you have to be for the peace and for the understanding with Israel. And since September 11th, we have a new belief-you have to be for partnership with America. Otherwise, you cannot work for us, you cannot come-you have to sign it in your contract. My kind of guy. Okay, so I would like to start. ENTITY, the fifth anniversary of the terrible 9/11 attack is nearing. Has the Western world really learned the right lessons from 9/11? Yes. The Western world, by and large, understands that we face an enemy that is coldblooded and will kill innocent life to achieve an objective. That killing not only took place on September 11th here in our country, but it has taken place in other countries around the world since then. Secondly, the governments of the Western world understand that in order to protect our respective peoples, there must be intelligence sharing. We must be willing to converse with each other in ways that might not have happened before. In other words, if we know something is going to happen in Germany, it is very important for the United States Government to call up its counterparts and to share that information. And there is a lot of that information sharing. Thirdly, we understand that money is what fuels these terror cells. And the idea of sharing intelligence about the movement of money is necessary to make sure we protect our people. The degree of understanding about September the 11th varies, however. For some people around the world, September the 11th was just a terrible moment. For me and a lot of other people in America, September the 11th was a change of attitude; it was a call to arms in the sense that this is the first-for America-the first battle of the war in the 21st century. One of the things that I hope people come to understand is that there are two ways to defeat this enemy: One is to bring them to justice so they do not harm people, which means we have got to be constantly on the offense, finding them where they hide and bringing them to justice. And secondly is that the way to defeat their hateful ideology is by the spread of liberty. That notion-some understand that, and some do not . But I want your readers to understand, I fully understand it-that liberty will yield peace that we all want. And so part of our strategy is to work with countries, particularly in the Middle East, to encourage the spread of liberty and freedom. And we are making progress there. But still we see bombs in Tel Aviv-- Yes. --suicide bombers. And just a couple of days ago, even the U.S. Government delivered a warning that there could be attacks and strikes at the World Cup in Germany. Yes. Do you really believe we have a chance to win the war against terrorism? Absolutely. I know this: That if we do not try to win the war on terrorism, the world will be a lot worse off; that if we believe these are just isolated incidents and people are maybe just temporarily angry, it is an attitude that will ultimately lead to more catastrophe, more danger. This is an enemy which is-has clearly stated they have ambitions. They want to spread their ideology throughout-starting in the Middle East. They want to topple moderate government. They want to-they believe capitalists and democrats are soft- by democrats, I mean people living in democracies-are soft. They believe it is just a matter of time before the Western world tires. They have stated clearly they want weapons of mass destruction and that they want safe haven from which to launch their attacks. This is what the enemy has said. And I think those of us in positions of responsibility must take the words of the enemy very seriously. They can be defeated, and they will be defeated, so long as we do not lose our nerve. And so the United States is committed to finding these folks where they hide, to bringing them to justice, which we are doing, and to-but recognizing that the world has changed from the world of the past because of the spread of liberty. Just look at Europe; it is whole, free, and at peace, because democracies live side by side in peace. That is one of the great lessons of the 20th century. And it is a lesson that must be applied to the 21st century. And so, absolutely, we can win this war on terror. The victory in the war on terror will not come with a signing ceremony. The victory in the war on terror will come as the enemy becomes more and more marginalized. You cannot judge defeat or victory on whether or not a suicide bomber is able to pull off an attack. You can see progress in the war on terror as new democracies take hold around the world and deny-which denies an enemy a safe haven. And one such democracy that is now evolving and getting stronger is Iraq. Another such new democracy is Afghanistan- 50 million people who once lived under the thumb of a tyrant-or two tyrants now are free. And I strongly believe the world is better off for it, and I know that those two democracies are a major defeat for the terrorists. We have to learn in dealing with the Muslim world. Do we learn the right lessons? Do we have to deal in a different way with the Muslim world? There is a-there needs to be more understanding between the Muslim world and the Western world. There needs to be a better understanding of the true beliefs of their respective religions. We must understand, words mean things to different people. There is got to be a better way to communicate with ourselves. Sometimes my own messages send signals that I do not mean to send-but stirs up anxieties in the Muslim world. On the other hand, I take great comfort in knowing that the true Muslim-Islam, itself, is a peaceful religion, and those who adhere to Islam are people that respect the rights of others. And there is common values in the great religions. And what we cannot allow happen is for these totalitarians, these Islamic extremists, to distort a great religion and define the nature of that religion. And so there is a lot of work that needs to be done between America and the West and the Muslim world, but we can do that work without sacrificing the need to defend ourselves and without condemning people to tyranny. How important is the partnership between the United States and Europe when it comes to the war on terror? The partnership between the United States and Europe is a vital partnership that transcends the war on terror. Part of our relationship is working together in the war on terror, but there are many other areas where we can and will continue to work together. One such area is, obviously, trade. Europe and the United States benefit from free and fair trade. Another area is to help those who are afflicted with disease, like HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa. Another is to deal with suffering that we see in the world. And hopefully, we will be very strong in our determination to end the genocide in Darfur of Sudan. But when the United States and Europe cooperate, we can achieve security for our people and enhance the prosperity for our people as well-as well as do our duty. See, I believe there is a duty to help ease the suffering in the world. I believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. And the United States- the people of the United States have been given a lot. We are a blessed nation-and same for the people of Europe. And we have a duty to work together to help relieve the suffering of those who are less fortunate. In this context, is Russia a reliable democratic partner? Russia is a country in transition. And if you really think about where our fathers, at our age, if they had been sitting around talking about Russia- maybe a little younger-they would have been talking about an enemy, the great Soviet Union. And by the way, that enemy at that point in time bound the relationship between Germany and the United States- at least a part of Germany and the United States-very closely. It gave us a common front. So Russia no longer is that enemy, and that is a major change. Secondly, Russia is a country that has made some signals that are mixed signals, signals that allow-cause us to question their commitment to whether or not they intend to become a true democracy, where there is a freedom of the press or freedom of religion, all the different freedoms that are inherent in democracy. I, personally, have a working relationship with Vladimir Putin, and that is very important. I have got a warm relationship with him. It is a relationship where I can sit down with him and ask him direct questions as to why he is made the decisions he is made. It is a relationship where he questions me about what the intentions of the United States may be. It is one that I value, and I think it is an important relationship not only for the United States to have, but it is an important relationship for countries in Europe, for the United States to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin. One of our concerns is economic nationalism, to a certain extent, where he is using his oil companies to achieve what appears to be political objectives. And we make our concerns known when someone uses natural gas, for example, to effect-to send signals to government. As you might recall, Secretary Rice was in Europe, and she spoke out loudly about the gas contracts with Ukraine. And the reason she did that is it is -we have a duty to express our concerns, but in such a way that the relationship is one that-where, at my level, I am able to be comfortable in discussing concerns with Vladimir Putin. We have got commonality when it comes to dealing with proliferation. It is very important that the United States and Russia work closely to make sure that nuclear materials are stored as safely as possible. We have got commonality when it comes to fighting the war on terror. And we have now got a new, important issue to work together on, as well as working together with Germany and others, and that is Iran. What role must Germany play in the war on terror? Germany plays a vital role in the war on terror. Germany is in the heart of Europe. Germany is-whether it is this current administration or the previous administration, we have had a-amongst our intelligence services as well as our law enforcement services-a close coordination and a close discussion. Germany's will is important. When the German Chancellor stands up and says, The war on terror must be won, or- is a vital part of the security of our peoples, people around the world listen. Germany plays a very important role. Taking a look at the past, do the Americans feel that the Germans abandoned them when they went to war with Saddam Hussein? I have come to realize that the nature of the German people are such that war is very abhorrent, that Germany is a country now that is-no matter where they sit on the political spectrum, Germans are-just do not like war. And I can understand that. There is a generation of people who had their lives torn about because of a terrible war. I felt like-I made the decision I made based upon my full understanding that threats must be dealt with before they come to fruition. And I fully understood during that period of time not everybody would agree with me. And so we put together a significant coalition and followed through on a difficult decision. The point now is not what went on in the past; the point now is, how do we work together to achieve important goals? And one such goal is a democracy in Germany. And I appreciate the German Government's-previous Government's support and this Government's support of helping the Iraqis rebuild their lives. Training missions are important. Debt relief was important. Gerhard Schroeder relieved the debt on Iraq. And all those gestures are very important gestures that say that even though people disagreed with the decision to go into Iraq, we now agree that it is important that a democracy in Iraq succeed. And that is how I view the relationship. The dictator is on trial now, but at the same time, the violence in Iraq is getting worse. Is it really a victory? Is the war against Iraq really a success? Oh, yes, it is going to be a success, absolutely. When 12 million people go to the polls-listen, these people lived under a brutal tyrant. People seem to forget, quickly forget, the nature of Saddam Hussein. This is a man who had used weapons of mass destruction on his own people. He had invaded his neighbors- Kuwait. He was shooting at U.S. aircraft. He was violating sanctions. He had-as we now know, he had been using the Oil-For-Food Programme to enhance his own standing inside the country. We did not find the weapons of mass destruction that everybody thought he had, but we do know he still had the capacity of making weapons of mass destruction. He had ties to terrorist groups. Removing Saddam Hussein has made the world a safer place. We found-particularly for Iraqis. We found graves stuffed full of Iraqi men, women, and children. This guy was a brutal, brutal tyrant. But it is hard work to go from a tyranny to a country based upon liberty. We have been there 3 years. And I think if you look at the history of-in post-World War II, it took a long period of time to recover. And yet we live in a world where there is supposed to be instant success. And my work and the work of those of us in Iraq require patience, and the need is to give the Iraqi people a chance. And they have not let us down. Just think about what happened in December: 12 million people voted. That is a lot of people going to the polls in the face of intimidation and threats. These are people that had no chance to express themselves at a ballot box during Saddam Hussein-in free elections. And yet when given a chance, they went to the polls. And now what you are seeing is the formation of a unity government. You have got Shi'a, Sunni, and Kurds, all committed to a unity government, all willing to fight off the terrorists, to get rid of the militias, and to form a government that the Iraqi people can be proud of. And no question, there is still Al Qaida, which has said they want Iraq as a base from which to attack, willing to recruit suicide bombers. Those are hard to stop. But slowly but surely, the Iraqis, with American help, are reconciling their differences politically, are marginalizing those who are still loyal to Saddam, and are bringing the Al Qaida and the foreign fighters to justice. But Iraq-it is still a long journey to peace, and now there is a new threat. You already mentioned it; that is Iran. Yes. Iran is on the way to a nuclear program. How are we going to prevent them from making true what they threaten us, for example, in destroying Israel? You know, it is interesting; the world in which we live is one that requires great confidence in our values and strength of purpose. And we are challenged with the Iranian issue. And I want your readers to know that it is my desire and my belief we can solve this diplomatically. And the best way to solve this issue diplomatically is for there to be common purpose amongst the nations of the world. Any diplomatic solution requires agreement on the goal. And there is solid agreement that the Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon or the knowledge and capacity how to make a nuclear weapon. That agreement-when I say that is the agreement, it is the agreement amongst Germany, France, Great Britain, the United States, Russia, China, and a lot of other nations. We all agree. And that is the most important step. If we did not agree on the goal, it would be impossible to put together a coalition, a group of nations anxious to say to the Iranians with one voice, You are not going to have a weapon. The way forward diplomatically, because of the intransigence of the Iranian Government, is to go into the United Nations Security Council. And that is where we are headed, and we are working closely with our counterparts to develop the tactics to move forward once in the United Nations Security Council. Our message there is, the Iranians have defied the world, and you are now isolated, and it is your choice to make. They must make the choice to give up their weapons. People have said to me, Well, why are not you at the negotiating table? We are at the negotiating table-in this sense: We are with our partners on a regular basis. I think about this issue a lot. I talk to respective leaders a lot; the United States laid down the Security Council resolution, along with others. I speak to Angela Merkel quite frequently on this subject. It is the number-one item on our agenda when it comes to international coalitions. And the thing that we have got to do is be effective. And what the Iranians are looking forward is weakness among our group. They want to see how firm we are. So one of my jobs is to keep people firm in our resolve. And it is easy, by the way, with your Chancellor. She is firm in her resolve. The German Chancellor and the new head of state, Olmert, of Israel, they said the Iranian President is as dangerous as Adolf Hitler. Do you share their view? I think that it is very important for us to take his words very seriously. When people speak, it is important that we listen carefully to what they say and take them seriously. For example, when Al Qaida speaks, I take their words seriously. When bin Laden says, We will bring harm to the West, I take them seriously. When Zarqawi says, It is just a matter of time for the U.S. to get out of Iraq so we can have safe haven, I take him seriously. Zawahiri, the number-two man in Al Qaida, he is constantly speaking about their grand designs to spread their ideology. And when Ahmadi-nejad speaks, we need to take it seriously. And when he says he wants to destroy Israel, the world needs to take that very seriously. It is a serious threat. It is a threat to an ally of the United States and Germany. But what he is also saying is if he is willing to destroy one country, he'd be willing to destroy other countries. And therefore, this is a threat that has got to be dealt with in a way that- where the world-this is an important moment for the world to come together and deal with this in a way that is diplomatic, so that the next person who thinks or the next country that thinks they can threaten will understand that there is an effective response. Do you rule out, as a last resort, a military intervention against Iran? As you know, I have said this on German soil; I have said it on U.S. soil, that my first choice is to solve this diplomatically. I think we can, but all options are on the table. ENTITY, it seems that since Chancellor Angela Merkel took office, the ice age between Washington and Berlin is over. Are good personal ties really so important for the relationship between America and Germany? I have always felt like it is important to establish personal ties with my counterpart. And the reason why is, is that the role of a ENTITY is to be a strategic thinker as well as to be able to understand the tactics necessary to achieve the strategic objectives. And in order to be able to work strategically with my counterparts, I have got to have a personal relationship with them. I have got to be in a position such that when they speak, I listen, and when I speak, they listen, so they know that there is a compatibility to the point where we are comfortable sharing ideas as we try to work together to solve problems. And this world is full of problems. You are in the Oval Office during this interview- there are-Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Israel-Palestine-I mean, that is just to name a few of the problems that come to this desk that I deal with on a regular basis. In order for us to be effective, I have got to have a personal relationship with other leaders so that we can work together to achieve common objectives. During a state visit in 1989, your father described Germany as partner leadership. Yes. Does this statement still apply today? Absolutely. Absolutely. And it is manifesting itself on the Iranian issue. Chancellor Merkel has been strong. It is very important for the Iranians to know that there is a Germany committed to working with others to send the strong message to the Iranians that their nuclear ambitions, their nuclear weapons ambitions, will cause them isolation in the world in which we live. You will visit Germany in July. What would you-did Angela Merkel ask what you would like to see in Germany? It is really interesting. She felt like it was important for me to go to East Germany-old East Germany. There is no East Germany now-the old East Germany. And, one, I appreciated that a lot. You know, we are all products of how we are raised and, in many ways, where we were raised. If people want to get to know me better, they have got to know my parents and the values my parents instilled in me and the fact that I was raised in west Texas, in the middle of the desert, a long way away from anywhere, hardly. There is a certain set of values you learn in that experience. I was very intrigued by dealing with a very strong woman who had been raised in a Communist country and what it meant-what it meant. I spent some time with her upstairs in the private dining quarters here in the White House complex, listening to her. I asked her what it was like to grow up as a child. And the interesting thing-she first described her mother and father, which said a lot to me about the kind of person she is. I thought that was really insightful. She talked about her dad, the pastor, and her mom. She talked about going to school in a Communist system. And she told me she wanted me to come to her home, which, in my part of the world, at least where I am from, inviting somebody to your home is a gesture of generosity. It is hospitality that is very gracious. And so I am really looking forward to going. I will let her plan my itinerary once I get there. And it is going to be a very fascinating moment for me. And I thank her very much for her invitation. Are there things that bother you about the Germans? And are there things that you envy about the Germans? I am-look, I mean, Germans have always been incredibly efficient, capable businesspeople, and when they make a product, it is always of the highest of quality. The only thing that interests me about Germany is-it is not bothersome, but it is just a challenge for Germany-is the absorption of East and West, and the difficult assignment it is to really help the eastern Germany develop an economy that will be able to give people hope. But, again, I have great respect for Germany. What kind of role does Germany play in the world? Germany is vital for the European Union's vitality. And Germany- and that is important for the United States. Listen, we want our trading partners to be strong. If you-if we have trade between one another, it really helps when there is economic vitality with your partner. You want your partner doing well. Trade is not a zero-sum game. Trade is an opportunity for a mutually beneficial relationship. And therefore, we want the European Union's economy as a whole to be doing well. And Germany has a great-when Germany's economy is vibrant, it has a chance to really help all the countries around her to grow well. The U.S. economy is booming. Yes, it is, thankfully. Yes. It is booming because you made big tax cuts. True. What do you think about the Germans-are you-they acting correctly if they increase taxes now? We have-our economy is booming for several reasons. One is, no question, the tax cuts help, and I intend to keep our taxes low. Secondly, our work rules are very flexible, and so is our economy. We have got some issues that put us at a competitive disadvantage, and one is we have got too many lawsuits. And we are trying to do something about that. I am smart enough, however, to allow each country to make its own fiscal decisions as suits the needs of their constituents and the people. You are a practicing Christian. Does having a German Pope 60 years after World War II have a special meaning to you? You know, it is interesting that the last two Holy Fathers were from the same neighborhood. The Holy Father who just passed away, who was a great man, came from Poland and really helped rally the spirits of the people to challenge the tyranny of communism. And the current Holy Father came from a country torn asunder by war and is witness to a renewal of a united Germany. And I think it helps the world to have that perspective in a very important position of leadership. I admire the two Popes. These are strong, capable men who challenge the concept of moral relevancy. Three last very short questions. What was the most wonderful moment in your terms of being ENTITY so far, and what was the most awful moment? The most awful moment was September the 11th, 2001. The famous picture, when somebody gave you the information? Yes, that. I think, like all of us, it took a while for the-it was more than a moment. It was the event and the aftermath. On a situation like that, it takes a period to understand exactly what was going on. When somebody says, America is under attack, and-you have got to fully understand what that meant. And the information coming was haphazard at best for a while. We were not sure if the State Department got hit. I'd heard the White House had got attacked. Of course, I was worried that-my family was here. And so I would say the toughest moment of all was after the whole reality sunk in, and I was trying to help the Nation understand what was going on, and at the same time, be empathetic for those who had lost lives. The best moment was-you know, I have had a lot of great moments. I do not know, it is hard to characterize the great moments. They have all been busy moments, by the way. I would say the best moment was when I caught a 7 1/2 pound largemouth bass on my lake. Perfect. Very last question-you are a great sports fan. Yes, I am. How important is the international World Cup in Germany? And what is your personal take on who will be at the end, the world champion? Listen, the World Cup is a-first of all, most Americans, up until recently, did not understand how big the World Cup is. And we are beginning to understand. And the reason why is, a lot of us grew up not knowing anything about soccer, like me. I never saw soccer as a young boy. We did not play it where I was from. It just did not exist. I cannot even- I am thinking about all the-between age 6, when I can remember sports, and 12 or 13, I just never saw soccer being played. And so there is a generation of us that really were not fanatic. There is a new generation of Americans that did grow up on soccer. And there is obviously a huge interest amongst that crowd in the World Cup. And some of us older guys are now beginning to understand the significance of the World Cup around the world. It is the major sporting event worldwide, and it is got to be a great honor for Germany to host the event. And I am confident that the German people will do a magnificent job of welcoming people from around the world. And, of course, my team is the U.S. team. They tell me we have got a good team. Now, whether it is good enough to win it all, who knows? But I know they will try their hardest. ENTITY, thank you very much.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithkaidiekmannbild", "title": "Interview With Kai Diekmann of Bild", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-kai-diekmann-bild", "publication_date": "05-05-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 314, "text": "How seriously do you think this civil rights situation is going to affect your chances, assuming you will be the nominee of the Democratic Party next year in 1964? Well, obviously it is going to be an important matter. It has caused a good deal of feeling, I suppose, against the administration in the South also, I suppose, in other parts of the country. Whenever you have an issue upon which people feel so strongly, quite obviously it has its political effects, so I would say it would be an important matter. On the other hand, I am hopeful that both parties, Republicans and Democrats, will commit themselves to the same objective of equality of opportunity. I would be surprised if the Republican Party which, after all, is the party of Lincoln and is proud of that fact as it should be, I would be surprised if they did not also support the right of every citizen to have equal opportunities, equal chance under the Constitution. There is no sense in blaming it, of course, on Washington. That is the convenient place to blame it, and I suppose that is one of the reasons why we are there, but this is a problem that goes into every community across the country, every family, and everyone has to make a decision. It is going to take time. I think it is finally going to be done, but we are trying to do something much more difficult than any other country has ever done. A good many people who have advised us so generously abroad have no comprehension of what a difficult task it is that faces the American people in the sixties, but I think that the United States Government, I believe that both parties, and I believe that the great mass of opinion is in favor of making progress along these lines. And of course the most important area is finally going to be education which ties into jobs. Do you think you will lose some Southern States in '64? I lost some in '60 so I suppose I will lose some, maybe more in '64, I do not know. It is too early to tell but I would think I am not sure that I am the most popular political figure in the country today in the South, but that is all right. I think that we will have to wait to see a year and a half from now a year now. It is not that long. Are you making any estimate as to who your opponent might be in '64? No, there are a good many of them. There are a good many of them. Do you have any choice as to who you would like to run against, either to put the issues before the people or otherwise? No. That is a great mistake. I know some Republicans chose me in '60 as their favorite candidate so I do not think I can choose anybody. I will let them choose. ENTITY, this, after all, is Labor Day and there are almost 5 million Americans who do not have really too much to celebrate this Labor Day. It is another day of unemployment for them. Do you see any real hope in a booming economy where we still have to have this many unemployed, that in the next, say, 5 years, a second term for you, for instance, we can find a solution to this problem? There is no magic solution that suddenly is going to emerge. What it is, it seems to me, is a combination of actions which we are trying to take. What we have to realize is that to even stand still, stay still, we have to move very fast. We have 2 1/2 million more people working than when I came to office and yet a million and a half more people have come into the labor market. The answer, it seems to me, lies in a whole variety of programs. The tax cut, I think, is most important. That would be an $11 billion tax cut in a period of 18 months. We are not doing this just because though, of course, everybody would like to have their taxes reduced, but the major reason is because the lift it will give the economy, the assurance it will give us against another recession. So, in answer to your question, I believe that with the combination of the tax cut plus these other programs we can reduce that unemployment from the 5 1/2 percent. Most importantly, we can prevent it from being increased and I think we can get it under 5 percent in the period of 2 years, 2 1/2 years, but we cannot do it by just saying it will be done on its own. Too many people are coming into the labor market and too many machines are throwing people out. ENTITY, speaking of Congress, the atom test ban treaty comes up to the Senate in the next few days and everybody is predicting, as I believe you are, that it is going to pass by a very good majority. But, as all of the argument about it, discussion about it, and even suggestions from high places, including former President Eisenhower, have a reservation on the treaty, do you think that this has hurt the spirit that prevailed in getting this treaty in the first place? No, if the treaty is not substantial enough to stand discussion and debate, then, of course, it is not a very good treaty. I think what would be most desirable is, after all of this discussion and debate then to get a very strong vote in the Senate. I think a reservation would be a great mistake. I do not think President Eisenhower used the reservation in the formal sense that he wanted the Senate of the United States to put a reservation on the treaty, because that would mean that the treaty would have to be re-negotiated. He was concerned that we would make it very clear that we had the right to use nuclear weapons in time of war. Well, of course we do have that right. We have stated it. The committee report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will restate it, so I think that that will deal with the problem that concerned him. Otherwise, I think a reservation which would require us to re-negotiate the treaty with nearly a hundred countries, in my opinion it would be better to defeat the treaty. ENTITY, the only hot war we have got running at the moment is of course the one in Viet-Nam, and we have our difficulties there, quite obviously. I do not think that unless a greater effort is made by the Government to win popular support that the war can be won out there. In the final analysis, it is their war. They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of Viet-Nam, against the Communists. We are prepared to continue to assist them, but I do not think that the war can be won unless the people support the effort and, in my opinion, in the last 2 months, the government has gotten out of touch with the people. The repressions against the Buddhists, we felt, were very unwise. Now all we can do is to make it very clear that we do not think this is the way to win. It is my hope that this will become increasingly obvious to the government, that they will take steps to try to bring back popular support for this very essential struggle. Do you think this government still has time to regain the support of the people? I do. With changes in policy and perhaps with personnel I think it can. If it does not make those changes, I would think that the chances of winning it would not be very good. Has not every indication from Saigon been that President Diem has no intention of changing his pattern? If he does not change it, of course, that is his decision. He has been there 10 years and, as I say, he has carried this burden when he has been counted out on a number of occasions. Our best judgment is that he cannot be successful on this basis. We hope that he comes to see that, but in the final analysis it is the people and the government itself who have to win or lose this struggle. All we can do is help, and we are making it very clear, but I do not agree with those who say we should withdraw. That would be a great mistake. I know people do not like Americans to be engaged in this kind of an effort. Forty-seven Americans have been killed in combat with the enemy, but this is a very important struggle even though it is far away. We took all this made this effort to defend Europe. Now Europe is quite secure. We also have to participate we may not like it in the defense of Asia. ENTITY, have you made an assessment as to what President de Gaulle was up to in his statement on Viet-Nam last week? NO. I guess it was an expression of his general view, but he does not have any forces there or any program of economic assistance, so that while these expressions are welcome, the burden is carried, as it usually is, by the United States and the people there. But I think anything General de Gaulle says should be listened to, and we listened. What, of course, makes Americans somewhat impatient is that after carrying this load for 18 years, we are glad to get counsel, but we would like a little more assistance, real assistance. But we are going to meet our responsibility anyway. It does not do us any good to say, Well, why do not we all just go home and leave the world to those who are our enemies. General de Gaulle is not our enemy. He is our friend and candid friend and, there, sometimes difficulty but he is not the object of our hostility. ENTITY, the sending of Henry Cabot Lodge, who after all has been a political enemy of yours over the years at one point or another in your career, and his sending him out to Saigon might raise some speculation that perhaps you are trying to keep this from being a political issue in 1964. No. Ambassador Lodge wanted to go out to Saigon. If he were as careful as some politicians are, of course, he would not have wanted to go there. He would have maybe liked to have some safe job. But he is energetic and he has strong feelings about the United States and, surprisingly as it seems, he put this ahead of his political career. Sometimes politicians do those things, Walter. Thank you very much, ENTITY. And we are fortunate to have him.

{"id": 371, "text": "ENTITY, is Buchanan doing the right thing thinking about running? I have not paid much attention to that yet. ENTITY, do you have any comment on the Lockerbie indictments? We will have, but I want all that to come out properly. And then I will undoubtedly have something to say. That was a terrible event. And indictments -- we have a system of justice in this country. But I gather from briefings I have had that they are serious. I mean, this is not some quick hit, quick fix on trying to find the answer; that this is very serious business that we are involved in. But I will have more to say about that after I have had a chance to get briefed on the indictments themselves. I have been briefed on things that are leading up to all of this. Well, are you concerned that although, sir -- Mr. Barr said that it is believed that the two Libyans were operating as part of the intelligence operation. As I say, I am not going to comment until I am briefed on the formal indictments. I have been briefed on events leading up to the indictments and the paper trail and a lot of things that go into all of this. This has been a serious search for a long time. And some have been unfairly condemned because of lack of information. So, I do not want to comment on that until I have gone into it in more detail. But I have seen enough of it to know that there is been some very good work done on the part of the U.S., working in cooperation with others to get this far. But I just have to stop short of going further until I am thoroughly informed as to exactly what counts are in this indictment and all of that. ENTITY, have you now decided to wait until the State of the Union to put forward a growth package? Well, we are going to be, as I keep saying, we have got a growth package out there, and it is got some fine ingredients. In fact, one of the subjects we are talking about today has some growth aspects to it, as a matter of fact. And we are talking energy here today. But I just wish that the Democratic leadership had moved on the initiatives that I have been talking about for a long, long time in terms of growth. But I will get some advice here this afternoon on that and see what we have got. But I am glad we got together on this unemployment compensation bill, as a matter of fact. We have been saying all along we want a bill that is temporary, does not lock in more and more mandates. We want a signable bill that would not invoke the emergency escape from the budget agreement, from the fiscal -- and we have just insisted on that. We wanted a signable bill that is paid for and does not burden the 96 or 94 percent of the people, whatever it is, that are working. And we have gotten such a bill. And we could have had it last summer if certain leaders up there had not wanted to try to inflict a political defeat on me. And the people that are hurt are those that need help, those whose benefits have run out. And so I had to insist on these fiscally sound measures. And to the credit of the Senate, Bob Dole particularly, who is taken a strong leadership position, we now have a bill that meets those three criteria. And we did not have it before. And I find the only way you can get good legislation with some, the way it works up there on Capitol Hill, is to beat back bad legislation. And that is what is happened. But you are going to let the economy ride as it is for a few more months before you propose anything new? -- -- certain things that we may be doing. But I will have a very strong State of the Union message that hopefully can mobilize the Democrats that control Congress, to do what they should have done some time ago. And we have got -- and I talked about it last night out there -- we have got several very strong growth initiatives out there. And as these Members of Congress know, you just do not get them through. But we will because that case will be taken strongly to the American people later on. So we will see. Are interest rates about as low as they can go, sir? -- -- take a final shot on the Cuomo question? What is that, ENTITY ? Get out of here. We are talking energy.

{"id": 19, "text": ", I know your time is valuable. Let me start my recorder here. The first thing I wanted to ask you, there have only been a couple of times in this century that Congress has come together, got their heads together enough, both sides of the Congress, to come together and pass legislation to give somebody citizenship. It happened with Winston Churchill, a few other people. I wanted to know if Congress does-it looks like the first thing they are going to do when they come back into town is work on the Elian Gonzalez case. If they did pass a private bill in both Houses and they feel like politically they have got enough backing to do that, what would you do with that bill if it got to your desk? I do not know. I have not thought about it. I think it would be-this is not Winston Churchill, for one thing. You know, I do not think that Congress should put its-unless they know more about the facts than I do, I do not think they should put themselves in the position of making a decision that runs contrary to what the people who have had to do all the investigation have done. I think that, obviously, if they believe the INS made a mistake, their decision is subject to challenge in Federal court. And the Congress-even Members of Congress can petition to be heard there. But I think that we are setting a-I think that it would irrevocably lead people to the conclusion that this was much more about politics than it was whether that little boy ought to be taken away from his father. They are basically taking a position that if you live in Cuba, if we can take you away from your father, you are better off-your parents. And I think that is -the INS reached a different decision, having exhaustively looked at what was best for that child. As you all know, I have no sympathy for the Castro regime. I signed the present bill. I think it is tragic how they have blown every conceivable opportunity to get closer to the United States. Just as we were making progress, they murdered those pilots. So I am not sympathetic there. But I think that we need to think long and hard whether we are going to take the position that any person who comes to our shores who is a minor, any minor child who loses his or her parents should never be sent home to another parent, even if that parent is capable of doing a very good job, if we do not like the Government of the country where the people lived. And again, I say I am not-I have no brief for the Castro government or for many of their policies. I think the way he has attempted to politicize this is also terrible. It is not just the Cuban-Americans that have attempted to politicize it. He has responded by attempting to politicize it. So this poor little boy is 6 years old. He has scars from his mother's death of which he can only be dimly aware. And making a judgment about what is in his best interest and what is most likely to give him a stable, healthy, whole childhood and allow him to grow into an adult as a solid person, I am sure, may not be free of difficulty. And I just think that the decision ought to be made, insofar as possible, independent of countervailing political pressures. , the State of the Union is right around the corner, so I guess is the State of the Union part of the interview. In the previews that you all have made available of what is coming up, it seems like most of it is beefing up programs that you already have, like today's announcement, and returning to-- It is quite a beef up. This is the biggest thing ever done-yes-- Quite a beef up-which is-or trying to get back to unfinished business. And I was wondering whether you were planning on trying to go for some new breakthrough issue this year, or whether that is not really possible in a last year. Oh, I think that when you see everything we recommend in the aggregate, you might think that in terms of specifics, it is the most ambitious set of proposals since my first year. Last year was a very ambitious speech, but in terms of what I asked the Congress to do, it required some willingness on their part to meet with me and work through a joint position on Social Security, for example, or joint position on Medicare. I still think we may get a joint position on Medicare, and we may get part way there on Social Security. I am still going to try to persuade them to take all the interest savings that we get from not spending the Social Security surplus and putting that in the Trust Fund; that will take Social Security out to 2050, beyond the life of the baby boom generation. So I am still not sure we will not make that, but if you just look at the specific policy proposals I will make, not just in the unfinished business area but in the new area-and the unfinished business is important. I mean, you have got the Patients' Bill of Rights, closing the gun show loophole, and banning the import of large ammunition clips. You have got the minimum wage. You have got the hate crimes legislation, the Employment Non- Discrimination Act, the prescription drug for Medicare. So we have got a huge-even though we got a great deal done at the very end of the last Congress, there is a big unfinished business list. And then, as you know, I have been rolling out a lot of these new proposals. And actually, there will be a couple of things that will be quite new that I am not prepared to release yet. But I will have a couple of new proposals. But I think that the most important thing to me is to keep the country moving in this direction and aggressively embracing change, the right kind of change. That, I think, is critical to keep the recovery going, to keep bringing more people into the process of prosperity, and to keep bringing the country together. I think that is very important. So a lot of what I will recommend that is new is certainly consistent with what I have been doing for 7 years. I came to office with a very clear idea of where I thought America was off base, what I thought we ought to do, what kind of governing strategy I would have. And I believe that it is working. And I think people- some people will say, Well, he does things in increments. But if you walk down the road 7 years and you look back-I mean, if I told you 7 years ago, after 12 years of quadrupling the national debt, I will give you in year 6 and 7 the first back-to-back balanced budget surpluses in 42 years, from a $300 billion debt, you'd say that is not an incremental change; that is a big change. But you do those things in small steps. If you look at the millions of people-we have cut the welfare rolls about in half-it happened in incremental steps. But it is a huge thing in the aggregate. And all the economic changes- we have got the lowest African-American, Hispanic unemployment rate ever recorded, the lowest female unemployment rate in 40 years, lowest poverty rate in 20 years, lowest single parent household poverty rate in 46 years. So you take it in steps, but if you keep walking in the same direction, all of a sudden your steps constitute a giant leap forward. In that larger mosaic, how do you-of your record and your legacy in what you have done incrementally-down the road, how important will it be if, 15 years from now, we have not made significant advances on the debt? I mean, already your budget soon will break the '97 Balanced Budget Act. And certainly the surpluses are far greater than was predicted at that time. But how will history judge this generation of leadership if significant-- I think we should pay the debt off. And I think we should do it in 15 years. And the proposals that I will make are consistent with that, based on our latest numbers. Now, I have two things to say about the '97 budget caps. They were very severe, and they were thoroughly shredded by the Republican majority last year by turning everything into an emergency. I mean, the census was an emergency; Head Start was an emergency; continuing defense expenditures were emergencies. So the caps are not disappearing this year; the caps were shredded last year. So the real question is-the question I asked our people to look at, and we spent lots of time on it the end of last year-is whether we could present to the Congress a budget that was not full of gimmicks, that reflected what the Congress spent last year, inflation in areas where with-had that-for example, in the defense area where we know they intended-and still could we do that based on what we now believe the figures are and what our costs are in health care programs and other things and still get this country out of debt in 15 years and still not spend the Social Security surplus. And the answer, we believe, is yes, that you can avoid spending the Social Security surplus, continue to get the country out of debt in 15 years, and have a spending program for the next 5 years that reflects the decisions made by the Congress in the last year, without all those gimmicks. And you could still have a modest tax cut, nothing anywhere near the high end of what people had talked about in the campaign and what the Congress tried to do last year, but you could still have a modest one. So I think this is an honest budget that is fiscally responsible and still gets us out of debt. And I believe that we ought to embrace these big challenges, and I think that our children will judge us very well if we do and somewhat harshly if we do not . Because in my lifetime- you have heard me say this over and over again, but I am not young any more. I am 53 years old. In my lifetime we have never had this combination of economic prosperity, social progress, national self-confidence, with the absence of internal crisis or external threat. Not that we have no problems at home or no threats abroad, but none of it is sufficient to derail us from trying to imagine the future and then go after it. And it seems the one-that one of the elements of that future ought to be a commitment to take America out of debt. Another element of the future ought to be a commitment from going to-what I said today-trying to make our country the safest big country in the world. Another element of that future ought to be trying to prove that we can grow the economy and dramatically reduce the global warming by maximizing technology. We ought to be able to prove that we can equalize the economic opportunity, that we can-without holding anybody back, that we ought to be able to bring economic opportunity to these poor people in poor places that have not had it. And I think in all those areas, in the education area, in the health care area, I think we will be judged by whether we made the most of what is truly a magic moment. The last time we had this sustained rate of economic growth with low inflation was in the early sixties, about 40 years ago. And if you look at the indicators now, compared to then in the aggregate, I think you would say our economy is stronger today, but there were a couple of years there where unemployment averaged under 4 percent and without much inflation. And it all came apart, first trying to come to grips with the civil rights crisis at home and then trying to pay for the war on poverty and the war for equal opportunity and civil rights and the war in Vietnam abroad. So that, basically, we had a moment there that we lost, not only because we became divided as a people politically but because our system simply could not accommodate building the America of our dreams. So what do you see as a threat to that? I mean, if the Vietnam period and all of that was a threat, what is the threat to that now? I do not think there is one. That is why I think we have no excuse not to really-this should be a truly historic moment in America. I cannot think of any time in our history when we have had this sort of opportunity. You might argue that it was similar, that the times which produced Theodore Roosevelt's administration, and then Woodrow Wilson's, were similar, where we were an emerging global power, we were basically at peace, where the world was becoming more integrated. You go back and read McKinley's speeches around the turn of the century-he was the first President of the last century-he said a lot of this. It is quite interesting. And so you might argue that that was a time like this. But I think that-and I think it is a time in our history that most closely parallels this. If you go back to the early 19th century, you can find historical parallels in the exploration of Lewis and Clark and the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory. But the world was so different then, it is hard to do. So I just do not think we ever have had a time like this. It is not to say we have no foreign crises or security threats. We do. But they can all be managed. And the cost of managing them now is not inconsistent with what our obligations are in science and technology, in education, in economic opportunity, across the range of other areas. , you spoke a while ago about how you wanted to keep pushing for change. And I was thinking what is happened to minorities under your administration, that they have seen a pretty drastic improvement in their standard of living because of the strong economy. But one could also say that attitudes toward race maybe have not changed that much. And I was wondering whether there was something that you thought you could still do about attitudes towards race in your last year. Well, I think they have-first of all, I dispute the premise. I think they have changed. I think that we continue to see evidence that it is still a real problem. I mean, the unfortunate comments that the Atlanta baseball player made, that is really troubling. On the other hand, the fact that Hank Aaron and Andy Young met with him is encouraging. I mean, you know, 30 years ago that would not have happened. I think-last night I watched-I was working on the State of the Union last night, and I had basketball on, on TV, muted. And I was watching the Minnesota Timberwolves play the Indiana Pacers. And they beat them on a buzzer-beater shot. And then they interviewed Kevin Garnett, who is a very young man. I think he is the highest paid player in basketball, but he is very young, did not finish college. And they asked him what Dr. King meant to him, and how his life had changed, and you could just see- of course, 30 years ago no young African-American would be making that kind of money and would have the kind of slant he had. So I think things are changing. But I think what I have to do-I think there are three things generally I should be doing. Number one, I think we have to continue to try to close the differential in education and economic advancement. For example, the African-American high school graduation rate right now is about equal to the white, non-Hispanic high school rate, which is quite extraordinary. But the college-going rate is different. And the Hispanic dropout rate is still quite a bit higher, largely because of the immigrants, first-immigrants. So I think that this economic empowerment agenda I have, and the education agenda, the Hispanic education initiative, all those things, closing those gaps, that is important. Number two, I think we need to continue to have a vigorous enforcement of the law and highlighting those things we do not agree with. And number three, I think we have to continue the activities of the President's Office on One America. I think we need to continue to appoint more people from different backgrounds. We need to continue to have more meetings. We need to continue to highlight the problems. And I need to continue to speak out and work on this in America. I said three, but I like to say the fourth thing is I think that when our country continues its mission to try to end racial and ethnic and tribal and religious conflicts around the world, I think that has a reverberating effect here at home. I can give you just one very concrete example. Chelsea and I went to Kosovo together, and we went to the military camp. And you have this highly racial and ethnically diverse American military, very conscious of what they were doing in Kosovo and trying to end ethnic cleansing, and also very aware that insofar as they work together and live together and create a genuine community where everybody was treated equally, the power of their example could have as big an impact on the people of Kosovo as the force of their arms. So I do not think this-this is the sort of work that may never be done, since in all of human history we have not succeeded in rooting out people's fear or suspicion of those who are different. And there always will be those radicals which seek to advance themselves by demonizing groups of others. But I think we are doing better there. I think we are doing-and I think there is a lot more we can do. The Chinese Army's daily newspaper has signaled its willingness to aggressively use the Internet as a venue for warfare, to attack our military websites and our military-attack us through on-line methods. You in your critical infrastructure report recently sort of achieved parity with that and-with your ROTC Corps idea and that sort of thing. But I am wondering what precedents that sets. Even what we did in the conflict with Serbia, the precedents that that sets is sort of like fighting each other, attacking each other's satellites. Are you concerned about the precedent that using on-line warfare in any form will have for future generations, since we are the most vulnerable set on the planet from E-commerce to a lot of our Government installations? Because we are more open, you mean? Yes sir, because we are more open. And more Internet-- So we bring down-in a hypothetical conflict, we bring down the PLA's air defense system, and they just take out our 911 systems and all that-turn out all the lights at every 7-Eleven in the country. Well, I think, first of all, it is unrealistic to think that such systems would not be the targets of our adversaries. I think they are far more likely to be the targets of terrorists, organized criminals, narcotraffickers, than other countries. I believe that the answer is that we have got to be as strong as we possibly can be in the whole area of cyberspace safety. We have got to be as resistant to cyberterrorism and assault as we possibly can. And interestingly enough, this is something we get to practice on every day a lot, because every day there are always people trying to break into our computers, break into the Defense Department computers, break into various security computers. And so we get to work at it every day. And we have given a lot of thought to how you protect power systems, how you protect telephone systems, how you protect financial records. And so all I can say is that the question you asked confirms what I said at the National Academy of Sciences, I guess over a year ago. I think that is when I spoke there. We have got to be prepared to deal with the explosion of technology in ways that could threaten our security, not only on data systems themselves. Another thing you are going to see-everything involving technology is getting smaller, the miniaturization of everybody. Everybody's got their little notepads now. I just got the Palm Pilot. He is way ahead. You ought to see old Kris's Palm Pilot. It is got everything from his great grandfather's birthplace-I just saw the newest AT&T and Nokia telephone that fits right inside the palm of the hand. Now, that same miniaturization process is bound to go on with weapons. So you are not only going to have the attempt that you mentioned to invade, to invade telecommunication systems and computer systems, but you are also going to have a miniaturization system that will affect chemical and biological weapons and other sophisticated traditional weapons, which will make them harder to detect, easier to use, easier to comport. You may have composite materials that do not show up on airport scanners. All these things are going to happen. That is why we are going to make cars out of different materials, make weapons out of different materials. And in the whole history of combat among nation-states and before that, feudal groups or tribal groups, the normal thing that happens is a weapons system will be developed, and it will enjoy a period of success, and then a defense will be developed to it, and then there will be equilibrium until a new weapons system is developed that will give some dominance, and then you will have some equilibrium. What we are trying to do with this massive investment we are making against bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, nuclear terrorism, cyberterrorism, is to collapse the timespan between offense and defense. One of the things, for example, that we really hope that will come out of the human genome is that we will be able to develop software programs that will immediately adjust the antidote for certain viruses. If there is a biological warfare attack and you have got a mad scientist somewhere who changes the-I am just making this up- but who changes the anthrax virus, for example, in some way it is never before been changed, and so then this person-and then they spread it over 400 people in some town, and they begin to come around-what we are attempting to do with the human genome project, what I think one of the corollary benefits will be is that you will have software packages developed so that you will be able to immediately analyze that, and someone will tell you exactly how you would have to modify the antidote to anthrax to meet the new strain that is resistant to all known antidotes. So this whole struggle, as things change faster and faster and faster and you have the miniaturization of weapons systems to parallel with the miniaturization of other communication systems, will be to keep closing the gap between offense and defense until there is close to no difference as possible. That is the struggle for security in the 21st century. And I have tried to put America on that path. Without frightening the American people, without raising alarm bells, I have tried to make sure that when I left office we would have in place a properly funded, properly staffed system to prepare for the security threats of the 21st century. All the press goes to the highdollar hardware systems-should we have a strategic defense initiative, a missile defense. , we are running out of time here, so do you mind if we move on to some other topic? This is a big issue. All I am saying is-I am not-missile defense is important if we can do it. And missile threat is important. But you should know that I consider both the cyberthreats and the miniaturization of these other threats very significant. But I do believe when I leave office we will have for my successor and for our country a system that will enable us to deal with it. Since you are talking to the Christian Science Monitor, we are interested in your spiritual journey, which you have mentioned a couple times. And you have talked about how amazed you have been by the power of forgiveness, especially in the last 18 months. And I was wondering if you could share with us what your own spiritual growth has been. Have you found any Bible passages particularly dear? Have you found any concepts that you have held onto that have helped promote your own spiritual growth? Could you just describe what is been happening with your own growth in the last 18 months? Well, this is a subject I think people in public life should address with some amount of humility and reluctance, not because people should not be willing to affirm their faith but because we should remember the story that Christ told, in effect, bragging about the people that prayed in their closets instead of on the street corner. So I say that with all-but having said that, I think the thing that has struck me is that in this journey I have made to try to- that really has been a lifetime journey for me, and it is certainly something that is deepened since I have been President and something that I had to really focus on the last 2 years-I think the thing that I have really had to work on is trying to gain some spiritual anchor that will enable me to give up resentments and disappointment and anger and to understand that in seeking forgiveness I had to learn to forgive. It is easy to ask for forgiveness. A lot of people think it is hard, but I think it is -when you plainly need it, it is easy enough to ask for. But we are taught over and over again that we cannot get it unless we give it. And I think what is-you know, there is the wonderful Scripture where people are admonished to forgive those not just in the same measure that they are forgiven but 70 times 7. I think that what I have gained more than anything else is a certain humility in recognizing how important forgiveness is, but how it does not count and it cannot count unless you can give it as well as ask for it. And that basically- I used to see life as a struggle for always learning more things, cramming more things in my head, anywhere I could do more things, you know. Now I see the search for wisdom and strength is also a process of letting go. A lot of things you have to let go of. And I have been helped a lot by a lot of these ministers that have met with me and the Scriptures they have given me to read; by a lot of Christians and even sects of Christians have written me around the country with tracts on forgiveness, how you merit it in what you do and how you have to give it in turn; and also a number of people with whom I have worked as President. I learned a lot-I have had on more than one occasion the opportunity to talk to Mr. Mandela about how he came to forgive those who were his oppressors, you know, and how he felt about it and how he-what kind of forgiveness he ever sought for himself. I have really tried to deal with this in a very serious way, and I think I have learned quite a lot about myself in the process. And it is an ongoing effort. But I have to remember every day that human nature is so prone to find self-respect in some element of one's character that you think is superior to someone else, and a lot of this is a matter of letting go. You just have to learn to let that go, just get up every day, try to do the best you can, be the best person you can be, and continue that individual journey of growth. And I work on it-hard. And it is been a very humbling experience, but I think very much worthwhile for me, personally. Mr. Lockhart is giving me the one-morequestion signal, so I thought what I might do is use an old Wolf Blitzer trick which is-- Which is what-ask three questions? Ask a question with the second question. Well, briefly, you mentioned Chelsea just a moment ago. And as you know, the White House can be a pretty tough place on first kids. But the thing you always hear everybody talk about is the poise and the grace that she has now as a young woman. I am wondering basically what you attribute that to, and how you feel the press has been on her-if they have kind of been giving her a fair shake as the kind of parameters were laid out from the very beginning? And secondly, not at all related to that, is you were heavily criticized for the FALN commutations, and there is a lot of irony in that, in that you are the least pardoning President in the modern history. You have issued fewer pardons that any President in the modern era. I am wondering why you have not availed yourself of that Presidential power more, since aside from the FALN thing, there is typically very little fallout for that, using that power. Well, let me say first, I think- let me answer the first question first. Say exactly what you asked me about Chelsea again. The thing you hear everybody talking-- Oh, how the press treated her. How the press treated her, but how she, under the hothouse environment that the White House can be, with all the looking in-- I feel, first of all, very grateful that even though I do not agree with everything- first of all, I think it is impossible to generalize about the press, and it will become harder and harder to refer to something called the press. Where is the press in the publications in the merger of America Online and Time Warner, right? So I am always reluctant-I sort of knew what that was, I thought, when I got elected. I am not sure I know what that is anymore. But I think that, by and large, all elements of the press, with some very few exceptions, have been willing to let my daughter have her life and try to grow up and deal with all the challenges that entails and the extra burdens of her parents being in public life and all the controversies and ups and downs we have exhibited, without trying to shine the glare on her. And I am profoundly grateful for that, because I think every young person needs the chance to find his or her own way to maturity. And it is very difficult when your parents are as publicly exposed and prominent in daily life as her parents are. And it is made more difficult if you are prematurely turned into a public figure. I think to some extent she is one anyway, whether she is in the press or not. But I think basically the press has been sensitive to that. And I am profoundly grateful for that. And I hope that the life that her parents have lived in public life has been-has offered more good than bad for her, as a child growing up. And she is a young woman now, and I hope that, on balance, it is been a positive thing. We love her very much, and we hope that it is - and believe that, on balance, it is been good. On the related question of the pardons. Let me say about-- Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. She is going to get a pardon. I want to say something here that nobody has ever given me a chance to say in public before. This is important to me. And I have been working on this hard. I did not know until-ironically, until the controversy over the FALN thing that I had, apparently, both commuted fewer sentences and issued fewer pardons than my predecessors. I did not know that, but you should know what my generic attitude is. Generically, I believe a President should rarely commute sentences and should have good reasons for doing so if he does, knowing that that will always be somewhat controversial-that is, if you attenuate a jury or a judge's sentence. That is what I did in the FALN case. I did it after Chuck Ruff, my lawyer, did an extensive survey. I thought it might be controversial. I regret it became as controversial as it was. I still think, based on the facts of those cases, I did the right thing. I still believe strongly that I did the right thing. And I can tell you categorically there was no politics in it, that Chuck Ruff handled this, and everything he says about it is true. I think everyone knows him as being an extremely truthful person. He handled it entirely, and only he handled it. And then he dealt with me on it. Now should we do some more commutations? Perhaps we should. But I think I would probably always be on the low side of that. On the other hand, I tend to have a much more generous attitude on pardons, particularly because under the Federal system-I think people ought to get their voting rights back; I do not think they ought to be discriminated about in getting jobs or keeping jobs or getting contracts if they have discharged their sentence and they have been out in law-abiding society. Now, over time, before I ever got there, there developed a whole apparatus in the Justice Department which is its own independent bureaucracy for evaluating these things. And the tradition is that the President does not rule on them, one way or the other, until you get all these recommendations sent to you. And I think what I believe is that-although this operation has a life of its own, I have asked-I have tried to review it now because my instinct is that we should be granting more pardons. I do not mean we should just be cavalier. I mean if you still think somebody might be involved in something wrong-not so much to wipe away the past as to free people up to live in the present and future. There are all kinds of-suppose when you are 18 you commit some offense which gets you a 5-year sentence. And suppose-and let us suppose under the sentencing guidelines then applicable, you served 2 years of the sentence. Well, my view is if you served the 2 years, then you get out, and you have got 3 years on parole. So the 5 years is discharged. Then you have to serve-then you live a couple more years, and you have a totally exemplary life. I do not think that your past mistake should unduly cramp your present and future life. If you do something really terrible, you are going to be in prison for a long time. But I mean, people are just getting out all the time- 90 percent of the people who go to jail get out. When they get out, we do not have a vested interest in seeing them continue to be punished. Our interest as citizens, after they pay their debt to society, is to see them be successful. I mean, when somebody pays, then when they get out, surely we do not want them to keep on paying. If they have to keep on paying, that is why you end up with more crime and a less successful, less healthy society. So my instinct is that-again, I speak for myself; each President will be different on this- is that the President should be pretty reluctant to shorten sentences but should be willing to do so in appropriate cases; but that the President should be more forthcoming in being willing to grant pardons when it is not really for the purpose of pretending that it did not happen but of liberating people to make the most of their todays and tomorrows, because every single American has a big stake in people who actually do get punished later going on and living their lives in a straight and effective way. So that is my take on this. And we are looking to see whether there are any kind of changes we can make to be more effective in that regard. Thanks. I am glad you asked me. You are the only person who ever asked me that.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfrancinekieferandskipthurmanthechristiansciencemonitorboston", "title": "Interview With Francine Kiefer and Skip Thurman of the Christian Science Monitor in Boston", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-francine-kiefer-and-skip-thurman-the-christian-science-monitor-boston", "publication_date": "18-01-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 501, "text": "ENTITY, good evening. The relations between France and the United States for a long time had cooled down for quite some time, for about 3 years, since the intervention in Iraq and since the opposition of three major countries: Russia, Germany, and France. And this quote was lent to your administration, whereby we should forgive Russia, forget Germany, and punish France and France was punished for its rebelliousness. And number two, is the punishment over? First of all, I never really felt that a disagreement over Iraq should yield a rupture in relations. I fully understand why people disagree with my decision, and so I never really subscribed to that theory. So there is no punishment, really, in my from my perspective. Secondly, I value the relationship a lot. And the United States and France have had a long history. After all, much of our independence was achieved as a result of the aid of the French. And we have been through wars together; we have had our agreements and our disagreements. So I have really worked hard to make sure the relationship was bigger than the individuals. Nicolas Sarkozy of France Has that changed the situation somewhat, given the fact that Mr. Sarkozy has replaced Mr. Chirac? Of course, in the sense that every individual matters. In other words, I have dealt with a lot of foreign leaders, and some and each person brings their own set of personalities and values. And President is a man of deep values. He is got a lot of energy. He is a lot of fun to be around. Plus, he is a serious man, and he wants to so he is like me; he wants to solve problems Here is a problem, let us go solve it. And so I am looking forward to visiting with him. The relationship is good, and I intend to work to keep it that way. With distance, do you think that the French arguments at the time whereby there were no weapons of mass destruction, which was proven; there is no direct relationship with the September 11th attacks. So do you think that these arguments were justified? So do not you regret it after all? No, I do not at all. Absolutely, getting rid of Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do. Now, first of all, nobody ever said that the September 11th attacks were ordered by Saddam. That is myth. That was never part of my argument. And secondly, I did go to the United Nations Security Council and 1441 was supported by the French which said, disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. You would not say that if you did not believe he had weapons of mass destruction. Now, in hindsight, he did not . Do I think the world is better off without him? Absolutely. I know Iraq is as well. And so my decision was the right decision. Again, I understand why people do not like the use of armed force. That is natural. On the other hand, the liberation of 25 million people is noble. And now the question is, will we work together to help this young democracy survive in the face of extremists and radicals who kill the innocent in order to achieve their political objectives? And I cannot thank President enough for sending the Foreign Minister to Baghdad, which basically said, we want to help you survive. We think democracy is a great alternative to the ideology of mass murderers. And that is the question we are faced with, those of us who live in the free world: Are we willing to help others realize the blessings of freedom for the sake of peace? But your father, during the first gulf war, had stopped at the doors of Baghdad. He left Saddam in sight, weakened, in power. So why did not you do the same thing as him? Did you speak with him? Did he tell you, son, you can do what I did not do 10 years ago? So ultimately, do not you wonder as to that may not be what actually destabilized the region ultimately? No. I think there is what we are witnessing is a great clash between radicals and extremists who murder and people who want to live in peace. And the situation was different in 1991 than it was in 2003. After all, the United States has been attacked, and I said that we are going to deal with threats before they fully materialize. It is one of the lessons of September the 11th. Saddam Hussein was given a chance to disclose or disarm. He chose not to. He was the one who, once again, defied the world. He is the one who basically said, I do not care what the United Nations said and what France and the United States and everybody else on the Security Council said. And so I am very comfortable with the decision I made. But you say, does this cause there to be radicalism that causes the murder of the causes people to lose their life? Absolutely not. What causes people to become radicals is when they become hopeless and frustrated and fall prey to the whims and desires of a bunch of ideologues who murder innocent people whether it be in Iraq today or in Afghanistan today or whether it be in Lebanon or whether it be in the Palestinian Territories all trying to stop the advent of democracy because they cannot stand the thought of free societies in their midst. And the challenge for those of us who live in free societies, like I said, and the challenge for President and George W. Bush and other leaders is, are we going to sit back and not care whether people live in freedom, or are we going to help them realize the blessings of liberty? Because liberty will yield the peace we want. So to a certain extent, you did contribute to giving greater power to Iran, because it no longer is facing its hated enemy on the other side. So now is there a true threat in Iran, and are you ready now to invade Iran as you did with Afghanistan and Iraq? So it is indeed true that Vice President is it true that Vice President Cheney has a plan for that? Gosh, I do not know where you are getting all these rumors there must be some weird things going on in Europe these days because I have made it abundantly clear, now is the time to deal with a true threat to world peace, that is Iran, and to do it diplomatically and peacefully. And that is what I am going to spend a lot of time on with President. But of course, we want to solve these problems peacefully. But if it does not work, if the sanctions and the threats do not work, what happens? Well, we are going to as I said, all options are on the table. But the objective is to make them work. I mean, I am not so sure I agree with your hypothesis that if they do not work. I am the kind of guy that says, let us make sure they do work. And that is what I intend to talk to President about and Angela Merkel about, and that is to keep the international pressure and to keep the focus on the ambitions of an Iranian regime that has publicly declared its intention to destroy Israel, for example, and have defied the demands of the IAEA. And so they are not trusted to be trusted with a enrichment program. We made that abundantly clear to them. And I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically. But to say that to enhance a free society on Iran's border strengthens the Iranians is just not true. I simply do not buy into that logic or illogic, in this case. I think a free society on Iran's border is going to be make their life more difficult. I think that, ultimately, they are going to feel pressure about the type of government they have when their people look across the border and see a flourishing, free society. And so our policy is to work with friends and allies to say to the people, here is a problem, let us work collaboratively to address it, and now, early. But in spite of all your efforts, the United States today have a worse image today than they had 7 years ago. People find Americans less likable pretty much everywhere in the world. Do you have your own share of responsibility, or is this inevitable because the United States is the most powerful country in the world? Look, first of all, I think most people respect America, and they like Americans. They may not necessarily like ENTITY And so but I have always been the kind of person, Patrick, to make decisions based upon what is right, as opposed to trying to be the popular guy. I have always found the person who strives for popularity In the past, we used to say that the American Dream was freedom, but today it seems to be repression, more self-focused society. Oh, no, that is absurd. That is absurd to say the American Dream is repression. Freedom is the absolute we are helping people achieve. That is think about what is happening with 25 million people in Iraq or 25 million people in Afghanistan or the fact that the United States is freeing people from the scourge of HIV/ AIDS. We are spending $30 billion, when Congress passes my budget, to help people on HIV/AIDS or the fact that we have got a $1.6 billion program to help people who are families who are suffering as a result of a child dying from malaria. In other words, we have got a very aggressive freedom agenda. And if you come to the United States, you will find that you can practice your religion any way you see fit, that this is an open society and a free society. And so yes, I understand people's the image may not be as good as one would like, but people respect what America stands for. They may not like the decisions I have made, but I do not see how you can be a leader if you worry about public opinion polls all the time, particularly in a world in which there is a lot of problems that require strong leadership. ENTITY's Legacy And what legacy, what record would you like to leave in history? You have spent 7 years in the White House. You will be leaving in a year. What would you like the memory, the souvenir of you to remain? Well, certainly the fact that 50 million people have been liberated; that we have got a very strong relationship in the Far East; that we are friends with China, Japan, and South Korea something that is been hard for other ENTITYs to do. I think we can help stand up a Palestinian state. I am the first ENTITY ever to have articulated a two-party state, two states side by side in peace. Our HIV/AIDS initiative is very strong. I mean, we are leading the world when it comes to helping feed the hungry or take care of those who are ill. I think our malaria initiative will go down in history as a great initiative. And at home, some of my education initiatives and the fact that our economy has grown, in spite of recession, corporate scandals, and war and the attack on America. See, I am a tax cutter. I believe when people have more money in their pockets, they do better. And so I am you know, it is an interesting thing about history. You are really not going to know the history of the Bush administration until long after you and I are dead. There is no such thing as accurate, short-term history. It takes a while for people to see the results of decisions having been made. And so I am very comfortable, Patrick. I feel comfortable that the decisions I have made have been in the best interests of the country. I have been comfortable that I have had to deal with some tough problems, and I did not shy away from the problems; I tackled them head on. And I love my country, and I love what we stand for. And last question, who would you like to see as your replacement in 1 year? A Republican? A Democrat? Of course a Republican. But I am not you are trying to get me to take sides. You prefer Republican. Absolutely, a Republican. A woman? An African American? A veteran? Do you have a choice? Are there any people that you like more than others? Now, see, you are trying to cleverly draw me into the race for the Presidency. And one of the things that I have told the American people is, I am going to watch the Republican primaries unfold and not take positions and then go out and help my party's nominee win. And I think we will win the White House. I think whoever will get nominated from our party will win, because the big issues in America are who is going to be tough in this war on terror and who is going to protect our homeland and will they keep taxes low. And our candidates will be willing to take those positions in a way that appeals to the American people. But anyway, nice try trying to get me to endorse a candidate. ENTITY's Vacation/France-U.S. Relations We saw a French President spend his summer vacations this year in the United States. So when will George W. Bush spend his vacations in France? Thank you very much. As you know, I am a I have got a piece of property I love in Texas It is large. very much, and when I do, I like to go down there. But I would love to come back to France. It is a beautiful country. I have had some really good experiences there, and I have found the people to be very friendly. And, look, I understand there is disagreements. But from my perspective, the people of France really do respect what America has stood for and respect our alliance. And I was greeted with great respect when I went there. And so I'd like to come back sometimes. And I am looking forward to my meeting with President. It is going to be a constructive meeting. Once again, thank you very much, ENTITY Thank you very much for hosting us. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You bet.

{"id": 331, "text": "ENTITY, there has been a good deal of praise since your announcement yesterday concerning a new flexibility with respect to our negotiating position at the arms reduction talks in Geneva. A lot of people think it is the right medicine at the right time to get these talks moving toward a favorable agreement with the Soviets. But part of our position requires the Soviets to destroy, do away with, nearly two-thirds of their heavy missiles. Do we have any signs, any indication, inkling that they will go for this feature? Well, both sides, according to our proposal, are going to have to do away with some of their weapons. I think what you are referring to is a thing-on which we can be very flexible-and that is whether there is a sub-limit. I doubt very much that there will be much of a problem about the mix of weapons. The whole-our whole aim is a reduction in the number of missiles for both sides to the 5,000 limit and a reduction in the destructive power. This is another place in which they are superior to us. Do you detect a new spirit of compromise in the Kremlin, especially since Ambassador Harriman's trip? Well, that, or before it. The thing that makes me hopeful is that the Russians, who so many times just simply say nyet to everything, they did in previous meetings propose a lower figure than they presently have. And at least that is a starting point. We are willing to come up from the figure that we had, as I indicated yesterday, and so if one's the Moon and the other's green cheese, maybe we can meet some place in between. ENTITY, is it possible or is it now probable that you might have a summit meeting with Mr. Andropov between now and, say, next summer? I think it is possible. The only thing-there is no reluctance on my part to have one, except that there is a great danger if you have a meeting simply to have a meeting and get acquainted, and then everyone says, What happened in the meeting? And you say, Well we got acquainted. I think we have to have an agenda. And I think it has to be one in which both sides have agreed that they are really going to try to settle some of the issues between us. Okay. July 1st, a Federal tax cut is scheduled to take effect. In the past week, Speaker O'Neill has been demanding that a ceiling be put-a $700 ceiling be put on the maximum amount that any taxpayer can receive under this cut. He apparently wants to soak the rich or the wealthiest taxpayers more. Are you going to tamper in any way with this tax cut? No, I will fight to the death against that tax cut. And I'd like to point out that this whole thing about whether-soak the rich or something else-he had set the figure at $50,000. Under his proposal, a married couple that have a $35,200 income would find that their top bracket now is 33 percent. It would go to 37 percent under-or it will be 33 percent when the tax cut goes into effect. At $48,000 and something, the same married couple would find that they go from 38 percent up to 42 percent under his proposal. And this is not up to the $50,000 mark, and they are losing money. Seventy-two percent of all of the tax relief in this coming tax cut on July 1st will go to people below $50,000. Now, when you stop to think that with our graduated income tax the top 10 percent of earners in this country pay 50 percent of the total amount of tax and the top half, the top 50 percent of earners pay 93 percent of the total tax, I think it is only fair that a tax cut goes across the board, even Steven, the same percentage cut for everyone. Your top budget people are warning that the money supply is growing too fast, and there is a fear, at least among some of them-Stockman and Feldstein-that we could be headed for more inflation. Are you worried about that at this point? Not really, because I think that there is no question the market's been a little frightened by a surge there. And probably what makes them worried about that is the 1980-before we got here, there was a giant surge, and that was the one that took us up to 21.5 percent interest rates and so forth. And then the string was pulled very firmly-1981-bringing it down. In fact, if that string had not been pulled for so long and so hard, we might not have had the depth of recession that we have had. But it is a kind of an uneven thing. It is not something that you can actually specify and say it is going to grow exactly at this amount-the money supply. And a few weeks ago, there was something of a surge. The Fed has immediately moved on that, and I do not anticipate that. Sir, speaking of the Fed, will it be Mr. Volcker continuing, or might it be Mr. Greenspan? Can you give us any clue? All of that argument and speculation-we have not even gotten around to making a decision yet. Okay. You are well aware that State and local governments, school districts, say they are strapped for money badly these days. Under the recommendations of the Commission which you appointed on Excellence in Education, part of the recommendation is for the Federal Government-all levels of government-to help finance this. Are you satisfied that local governments can, in fact, find the money it is going to take to implement the longer school days and the back-to-the-basics curriculum that the Commission recommended? Well, the Commission report also made it plain that just throwing money at it is not the answer. Right now, the highest tax finance program in the United States is public education-some $215 billion. And incidentally, it has increased over the last 20 years, when everyone is so concerned about the decline in education, funding for education has increased by 600 percent. And in that some period, allowing for inflation in constant dollars, we have added a $66 billion increase in constant dollars over that same period in the per capita cost for each student. So, I do not think that money is the problem. But what is necessary is to work out Federal, State, and local, and what are the proper functions for each to perform in education, and then have the responsibility of funding those. Now education is basically a local and State function-always has been and always should be. At this moment, the Federal Government only supplies 8 percent of the total educational budget, and yet, one of the problems has been that over the years the Federal Government for that 8 percent has wanted about 50 percent of the control of the schools. Sir, the economy is rebounding. There is a business recovery in progress. And the Williamsburg summit appeared to go very well. Your health looks great. You look wonderful. I feel good, thank you. You seem ideally suited to a man who would be up for reelection. Can you give us some idea of what your thinking is on seeking a second term right now? Well, my thinking, basically, is that it is far too early for anyone of my position to announce his intentions. And I can tell you why. If I did, and the answer was no , then it would not do me any good to ask Congress for anything. I'd be considered a lame-duck. And if I said the answer was yes at this point, the media-forgive me-but the media, very largely would be tagging everything I did, including a trip to Minneapolis, as political in nature. When can we expect to know? I have not even really decided on that. All right. thank you very much. You bet, thank you.

{"id": 0, "text": "I would like to take this opportunity to underscore our great pleasure at receiving ENTITY and express once again our friendship and admiration and support for the Government and the people of Spain. and I had an exceptionally productive and cordial meeting today. We reviewed international and bilateral matters in an open, understanding, and democratic spirit that one would expect between friends and allies. We affirmed the need for strong leadership to deal with the political and economic and social problems which underlie so much of the unrest in the world today. We agreed on the importance of maintaining Western strength and solidarity in these critical times and expressed our desire to work closely together as we face the challenges ahead. We agreed on the desirability of early, positive, and balanced conclusion to the CSCE Review Conference presently underway in Madrid. I expressed our appreciation for ENTITY,recent initiative in this regard, which we will be discussing with our friends and allies. There are numerous areas of closer cooperation, including the pursuit of our common energy security interests. We value Spain as an important partner. We welcome the ENTITY's high sense of responsibility in guiding his country at this critical moment in its history. We applaud Spain's aspirations to join Europe fully and to make its voice heard in Europe's leading institutions. We believe the West's most fundamental resource is the strength of democratic institutions. The consolidation of democracy in Spain is a ringing affirmation of the vitality of Western institutions and the appeal of Western values. Good afternoon. First of all I want to thank ENTITY for this occasion to hold an open conversation with the U.S.A., which we consider a friendly country, a good friend of Spain. As you know, Spain is a very old European country who, among other things, discovered this land that nowadays occupies this great country of yours. But it is also a young country, not only because the country people are young but because we just recovered the dignity of being a democratic country. A simple definition of Spain would characterize what her foreign policy should be. Spain is a European and a Western country-the most Western of the European countries-nothing then more logical than its wish to, and its desire, to participate and integrate in the European and the Western world and cooperate with the Western world in a common destiny. But we are also a southern country in Europe. We are very close to Africa, and our coast is in the Mediterranean Basin. This defines another important aspect of our foreign policy: the north of Africa and the important waters of the Mediterranean Basin. The fact that I cannot communicate with you in English means that there is another dimension in our policy and identity: the fact that we can communicate in our language, in Spanish, with practically 300 million people in the American Continent. This gives a third dimension in the foreign policy of Spain, without meaning that any one of them means a priority against the others. Let me tell you that I am 41 years old, and during 33 of these years, I was dreaming of a free and democratic Spain. This is, of course, what we want and we hope for our people. But this is also what we want and we hope for other peoples wherever we can project this foreign policy. We, therefore, wish and want for other countries who can communicate with us in cultural level: peace, freedom, pluralism, and progress. Because it is America and because it is such an important country in the world, you will understand perfectly well that we want also to make our links with the United States even closer, which explains two things: first of all, my presence here accepting a gracious and very kind invitation of ENTITY , and my satisfaction because of the course of these conversations we have just had.

{"id": 544, "text": "Mr. ENTITY , this year marks the bicentennial of the beginning of Sino-U.S.. contacts and the fifth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. Mr. ENTITY , this visit at this time is, therefore, of exceptional significance. This is your first visit to China. Would you please, Mr. ENTITY , tell us your impression of the visit? Well, thank you, and may I say how pleased I am to visit your great and historic country. As a boy going to school in a small town in our Midwest, I used to dream of coming here. In those days China seemed a million miles away, and today modern jet travel gives us the privilege of seeing China, meeting your hard-working people and learning more about the progress that you are making, and visiting the many treasures of your civilization-one of the oldest in the world. Permit me first to thank you on behalf of Nancy and myself for the warmth of your welcome. We journey to your country to make friends, but already you have made us feel that we are among friends, and you have touched our hearts. Our only regret is our visit will be so brief. It is a little like, as a Tang Dynasty poet once wrote, looking at the flowers while riding on horseback. But I mentioned at the Great Hall yesterday that you have another saying from the book of Han that describes how Nancy and I feel: To see a thing once is better than hearing about it a hundred times. Our visit this year marks the 200th anniversary since the first American merchant ship called at a Chinese port. Two hundred years for your civilization seems like the blink of an eye, but for Americans they span the entire history of our Republic. Yes, your country is old while ours is young, and, yes, we speak different languages, have different customs, and, our governments hold different political beliefs. But I believe if you could look beyond labels and into the homes and hearts of our people, you'd find they share many basic values, values with your own-values like the dignity of work, the importance of opportunity, the love and strength of family, reverence for elders, the dream of leaving a better life for our children and our children's children, and finally our simple, heartfelt desire to be friends and to live together in peace. Americans are people of peace. It is important you know that. We pose no threat to China or any nation. We have no troops massed on your borders. We occupy no lands. After World War II, we were the only undamaged industrial power, the only nation to harness the atom, and the only people with the power to conquer the world. But we did not conquer anybody. We used our power to write a new chapter in history by helping rebuild the war-ravaged economies of both friends and foes. We love peace, and we cherish freedom, because we have learned time and again in place after place that economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides when people are secure and free to think, speak, worship, choose their own way, and reach for the stars. We admire the progress your government has made in opening China's economy to the world and in providing more opportunities for your people to better their lives. And we have told your leaders that as the world's leading economy, the United States welcomes the chance to walk by China's side, sharing our technology and encouraging a greater flow of people, products, and ideas between our two countries. Like China, the United States is a Pacific nation. A prosperous future is being built in the Pacific, and we are now your nation's third largest trading partner. We are working together to improve industrial, technological cooperation, increased trade and investment, and expand educational and cultural exchanges. Let us resolve that communication, not confrontation, and commerce, not conflict, will always govern Chinese-American relations. If we do, there is no limit to the progress we can make by going forward hand in hand-xieshou bingjin . And now I'd be delighted to answer any more of your questions. Mr. ENTITY , the Chinese public expect that your visit will give an impetus to the steady and the sustained growth of Sino-U.S.. relations. In your view, what concrete steps the Chinese and American sides should take to promote the further development of Sino-U.S.. relations? Well, we have taken a number already. The progress that we have made with regard to trade agreements, that we are discussing right now with regard to protecting your people and ours against double taxation. We have arrived at an agreement on nuclear cooperation for peaceful energy, and at the same time we have agreed to prevent as much as we can by ourselves nuclear proliferation of weapons to other countries. But we have had, I believe, five members of our Cabinet here in the last several months meeting with their counterparts in your government, working out everything from commerce and trade relations. Our Secretary of Defense has been here, our Secretary of State. We are discussing energy problems. So, we will continue along that path, finding all these areas of agreement and cooperation. And, as I say, we have made great progress already. Mr. ENTITY , both you and the Chinese leaders have expressed the desire for further development of Sino-U.S.. relations. Everyone knows that the issue of Taiwan is a major obstacle to the development of our bilateral relations. It is also an important matter affecting the national feelings of 1 billion Chinese people. Could you please tell us how the United States intends to gradually remove this obstacle? Well, we believe that this is a problem of Chinese people on both sides of the straits to work out for themselves. It is true that we have a long historical relationship, a friendship with the people on Taiwan. We believe that the solution when it comes should be peaceful, and we do not believe that we should involve ourselves in this internal affair. Our position, however, has been with the utmost sincerity. We want to go forward. with friendship for the people of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, we do not believe that it would be right to cast aside longtime old friends in order to make new friends. But we will do anything we can to encourage the peaceful solution of this problem by the peoples of China. Mr. ENTITY , there is a great potential for Sino-U.S.. economic cooperation. What measures the U.S.. Government is prepared to adopt to promote further economic and technological cooperation between the two countries? Well, I believe I answered that in part on your previous question here. We are going forward. We have made great strides in providing high technology information and high technology itself in trade with the People's Republic of China, and we have an agricultural agreement now with regard to our grain sales to you. But we also have worked out agreements covering other forms of trade. There are still some leftover prohibitions in some of our own laws, but we are working with the Congress-our own Congress-to eliminate those and have made great progress with that. And so, again, it is a case of continuing on the path that has already been started. For the last question, Mr. ENTITY , we would like to invite you to speak about your-perhaps your prediction for the prospects for the growth of Sino-U.S.. relations in the future. Well, I am very optimistic about this growth of the relations that have already been started. And I think in my two previous questions-or your two previous questions-I left out one of the most important things that should be mentioned, and that is the development of relations in education, the exchange of students. Just before I left the United States to come here, I met with a group of your students who are attending our colleges in the United States. There are some 12,000 in all, and we, at the same time, are looking forward to an exchange-our own students coming here. Of course, we also have a visitation in which roughly a hundred thousand of our people visit your country now with great interest and enjoyment. So, this, I think, is one of the great things for the future, as our young people get to know each other. I have always said that our troubles begin when people are talking about each other instead of to each other. And if we can have our young people talking to each other, I am very optimistic about the future. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY , for your accepting my interview. Well, it has been a great pleasure. I have enjoyed it. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrepresentativeschinesecentraltelevisionbeijingchina", "title": "Interview With Representatives of Chinese Central Television in Beijing, China", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-representatives-chinese-central-television-beijing-china", "publication_date": "28-04-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 165, "text": "You have been generous in explaining the Iran deal to all sorts of people, so I want to focus on two specific issues that are really concerning me and I know others in the Jewish community. The first is rooted in the legitimate fear that Iran will use some of its sanction relief to fund nefarious actions in the region, especially against Israel. In his statement opposing the deal, Senator Schumer said restrictions should have been put in place limiting how Iran can use these new resources. I am wondering what kind of further assurances you can give Israelis and their supporters that those resources will not put them in more danger. And how does that not spur on a conventional arms race in the region? Well, first of all, Jane, I think it is important to recognize that the reason that Iran came to the table to negotiate a no nuclear weapons pledge was because of unprecedented sanctions that we were able to structure. Congressional sanctions have been on the books for years. They have not been effective in changing Iranian behavior. What was effective was, when I came into office, our ability to mobilize vigorous multilateral support for sanctions and very vigorous enforcement of sanctions. And as a consequence, the Iranian economy really cratered. And obviously, that is now been compounded by the severe drop in oil prices. So, by definition, they were going to get some of their own money back as part of a deal. That was their incentive to engage with the world community in the first place. It is estimated they will get about $50 billion. But as we have said repeatedly, the bulk of those dollars they are going to have to use for propping up their economy and getting it back on an even keel. There have been protests inside of Iran that do not get reported on much here because teachers are not getting paid and pension limits are not being fulfilled. And so we anticipated and this is based on careful analysis by Treasury and Jack Lew that most of that money will be going to spur on their economy. Now, as sanctions are lifted, what will also happen is their economy will start improving. And by definition, as their economy improves they will have more resources, and some of that, undoubtedly, will go into building up their military capability. But as I pointed out repeatedly, Iran's annual defense budget is about $15 billion. The Gulf States, combined, spend about eight times that amount. Israel's conventional military capacity far exceeds any Iranian capability, and you cannot compare the U.S. military to Iran. So the goal of this deal is to make sure that the one real game-changer nuclear weapons is taken off the table. We now have a regional power that is good at asymmetric and unconventional and proxy aggression, and that is something that we, together, can confront and stop. This is why I had Gulf countries up to Camp David to start coordinating more effectively to interdict arms shipments, to improve intelligence sharing, to support coordination of ballistic missile defense systems. And as soon as this debate is over, we will, I think, be able to invigorate what has been an ongoing conversation with the Israelis about how we can do even more to enhance the unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation that we have with them, and to see, are there additional capabilities that Israel may be able to use to prevent Hezbollah, for example, from getting missiles. But I guess the point is that where Iran has been effective in its destabilizing activities, it is not because it is had a lot of money. It is because they have effectively used proxies; it is because they have invested in places like Lebanon for decades and become entrenched. And the reason we have not done a better job of stopping that is not because they are outspending us. The reason is, is because we have not been as coordinated, had as good intelligence and been as systematic in pushing back as we need to be. So the second big issue, it seems to me, is this question of what happens in 10 or 15 years. We know that we cannot I am sorry, before there is one other point, just for context and if you want, you can splice it into the previous answer the sanctions were so effective that even with the $50 billion And you are saying that is the $50 This is Iranian money that is currently been frozen But you have used the figure, $150 billion. Well, no , the initial estimates ranged from $100 billion to $150 billion. The analysis once a full overview of the money they had frozen overseas and what was already committed to various payments and what was not brought that analysis down to about $56 billion. So it is a significantly smaller number than people expected. But that is their money that is frozen. They will be getting access to that once they have done all the things they need to do to shut off the various pathways to a possible nuclear weapon that are called for in the deal. But the point I was going to make was that the sanctions have been so effective that even with that $56 billion, even with their economy potentially improving modestly as they see sanctions suspended, it is going to take, we estimate, till 2022 for their economy to get back to where it was, where it would have been had sanctions not been imposed. The reason I make this point is, is that their economy is and will continue to be in a significant hole even after sanctions relief occurs. And that is part of the reason that we have confidence that if we work effectively with Israel and our other allies in the region that we can counteract whatever additional resources they may have militarily. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead. So it is 10 or 15 years from now. We do not know what kind of leadership will be in Iran, and you have said repeatedly that this is not about regime change. But we can expect and here I am paraphrasing a reader of ours, Sam Kermanian, a Persian Jewish leader in L.A. and he wrote to us and he said, look, Iran is going to gain international legitimacy, it is going to have a stronger economy, the arms embargoes are going to be lifted, they will have more access to conventional weapons. You say that the United States retains the right always to use a military option if it looks like Iran is getting a nuclear weapon. But will not it be much more difficult , will not Iran be more formidable to attack 10 or 15 years from now when it is stronger than the way it is been the last few years, so isolated and so weak? Well, keep in mind that under the terms of this agreement, we have great confidence that not only will we have shut off the various pathways to a nuclear weapon, but we will also have installed an unprecedented verification and inspection mechanism that helps us to understand the entire nuclear production chain inside of Iran. IAEA inspectors will be there on a regular basis reporting what will be conducted on a regular basis. And we will, for the first 10 years, have maintained a one-year breakout time so that if they cheat, we will have ample time to catch them and call them to account. And that is a significantly longer breakout time than exists right now, and certainly a longer breakout time than will exist if Congress rejected the deal. Around year 10, 11, 12, that breakout time starts shrinking again and we are back to a situation in which they could theoretically try to dash for a bomb. But under the terms of the agreement, they will still be prohibited from having a nuclear weapon, so they would be violating international law if they dash for a bomb 15 years from now. They would still be subject to what is called the additional protocol a whole range of inspection mechanisms that are in place so that we would know if they were dashing for a bomb. And they will still be a military power that is far weaker than the United States and for that matter, will be weaker than Israel. And so, in 15 years' time, whoever is occupying my chair here in the White House will have more information about their nuclear program, will have greater international legitimacy in the event that the President needs to initiate a strike against Iran's nuclear program, will have the justification of them explicitly having violated international agreements that they entered into. And so the notion that somehow we are better off confronting that problem right now, rather than having 15 full years in which to monitor, learn about their program and be assured that they do not have a nuclear weapon does not make much sense. There is no scenario in which, in the absence of a nuclear weapon, Iran will be able to match the United States, Israel and its various Gulf allies if they tried to break out and get a bomb. Their economy may be better. We hope that by virtue of them interacting with the world's community on a more regular basis commercially, that that may moderate their behavior, but we are not counting on it. And the backstop to this agreement throughout is that we, the United States, are not giving up any of our capacity to respond if and when they pose a national security threat to us or they pose a national security threat to our friends and allies in the region, particularly Israel. So let us talk about Israel for a moment. Unquestionably, your administration has given unprecedented military and strategic support to Israel. But it is also apparent that the relationship in many ways between the United States and Israel, between the governments and even, in some cases, between some peoples, has grown toxic. And I am wondering now, looking forward, what do you think the Israeli government can do to repair this? What can your administration do? And what can American Jews do? There are always going to be arguments within families and among friends. And Israel is not just an ally, it is not just a friend , it is family. The relationships between our peoples, the shared values, the shared commitment to democracy , those things are so deep that they have survived arguments in the past and they will survive this argument. And so I understand the anxiety that it causes. But I think a testament to how sturdy the relationship is, is that despite this very significant policy disagreement, all the military, security, commercial, cultural cooperation that existed before this debate came up has continued unabated and will continue unabated. I think that once we have completed the congressional debate and the deal is in the process of being implemented, it will be important for my administration and the Israeli government to move forward on what I have been calling for since April, when the political framework agreement in Lausanne was first announced, and that is to sit down and ask the question, what are the major security challenges that we together face in the region, and how can we build on the already robust, unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation that we have to make our security arrangements even stronger? We had already begun a discussion about how we lock in our long-term security assistance to Israel under a memorandum of understanding, and those discussions need to continue. I already mentioned that as much intelligence cooperation and sharing as we are already doing, we need to do better if we want to stop Hezbollah from continuing to get missiles that can be trained on Tel Aviv. And so there is going to be a lot of just nuts-and-bolts work that has to be done, and that, I think, has to be the primary focus. I think the most important thing for those of us who believe it is our sacred obligation to stand up for Israel and to ensure its security , and that is for American Jews but also non-Jews who feel that same affinity . The most important thing we can do I think is to continue to have honest conversations and honest debate about what is most likely to provide that kind of long-term security. And I will say that sometimes fights within families and among friends can be more heated than fights with people that you do not care about , it is been true in my family, anyway. And so even over the next several weeks as we get to the conclusion of the congressional debate, I think it is important for everybody to just take a breath for a moment and recognize that people on both sides of the debate love the United States and also love Israel. I do get disturbed sometimes when I hear folks suggesting that those who oppose the deal are pro-Israel. We are all pro-Israel. The issue is how do we solve this very particular problem of making sure Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. There are legitimate questions and concerns that have been raised by critics of the deal. I have gone out of my way to say that I am prepared to stand there and answer every single one of them as long as it takes. We have thought this through carefully. But I think all of us have to steer away from incendiary language that suggests that either those who are in favor of the deal are appeasing Iran, or, conversely, that those who are opposed to the deal are not thinking about America's interest. That kind of language we do have to shy away from. There are people, even some of your supporters, who feel that you have contributed to some of that incendiary language. Do you feel that? Not at all. And I'd be interested in an example of that. Saying that people who were against the deal were warmongers. Well, I did not , that is not actually a phrase that I used. What I said in my American University speech, and I continue to maintain, is a very logical argument, a dispassionate argument, which is, if, in fact, we reject this deal, then we have to , and if we all agree that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon , that is not in dispute , then what are the alternatives? The alternative that has been presented by some is, well, we should just maintain sanctions and keep squeezing Iran and eventually we will get a better deal. That better deal has typically been defined as Iran not just giving up a nuclear weapons program, but giving up any sort of nuclear program, peaceful or otherwise. And what I have said, which I think has been confirmed by every expert on Iran, but also the international community, is that Iran would never agree to what they would consider a complete capitulation. And we would not have the support of the international community in that position, which means that sanctions would unravel. So that does not end up being a good option. And the critics have not responded very vigorously or effectively to that point. So if, in fact, that avenue is foreclosed, then what I have said is, is that by rejecting the deal, we leave ourselves with very few options. Iran potentially could continue what it was doing before we began these negotiations , shrink their breakout time to a matter of a few months or even a few weeks. We would not know what was taking place inside of Iran. We would be flying blind. And in that situation, then our most realistic option for preventing them from getting a nuclear weapon would be to take military strikes. Now, that is not a controversial proposition. Many of the people who have opposed this deal previously have said that is what we should do. Venues like the Wall Street Journal editorial page have said it. And now they are saying, what are you talking about, we never said that. Do a Google search. But the point is that at no point have I ever suggested that those who are critical of the deal are warmongers. What I have said is that if we reject the deal, the logical conclusion is that if we want to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, military strikes will be the last option remaining at some point. It may not be under my administration; it might be under the next one. And that is something that has to be taken into account in this debate. So I think it is very important to distinguish between impugning the motives of people. I do not think somebody like a Chuck Schumer wants war. That is not the argument I was making. What I have said is that if you reject the deal, we have to be realistic about what options are available, and we should not be pedaling the notion that there is going to be some easy answer and we are going to grab some magic beans and suddenly solve this problem, or that there is a short-cut where we just kind of continue with business as usual, and the Chinese or the Russians or the Indians or the Japanese are all going to agree to continue maintaining sanctions as they have been, despite the fact that they believe, as I do, that this is a very good deal and they disagree with those who oppose it. You talked about how you can repair the relationships going forward, and that there certainly had been times when Israeli governments and American governments had vehemently disagreed. But all those times were under Republican administrations, Republican Presidents Reagan, Bush. Are you worried about the effects this might have on the Democratic coalition and on the historical fealty that Jews in America have had to the Democratic Party? Well, first of all, American Jews, like African Americans or any other cohort of Americans, has a wide range of concerns. They care about student loans; they care about housing; they care about poverty; they care about women's health issues. And so it is not as if the American Jewish community makes decisions solely on the basis of a single issue. Obviously, Israel's security is an issue that is deep and emotional, and rightly so. And I do not worry about it because I am convinced that this actually will result in greater safety and security for Israel, as well as the United States. And if, when the cameras are watching centrifuges being pulled out, and stockpiles of enriched uranium being destroyed or shipped out of Iran, and facilities that are of most concern being shut down, and inspectors operating effectively , then I think people will have a different assessment of this deal than they would at a time when most folks find it difficult to follow all the technical aspects of this, and they are seeing commercials on television that play on the legitimate anxieties that folks have about a regime that is anti-Semitic and has denied the Holocaust and chants Death to America. It is always hard for folks to feel good about doing a deal with your enemy. But as people have pointed out, that is who you do arms control treaties with. That is who you have agreements with of this sort, are with your adversaries, not with your friends. So I think that one of the wonderful things about the Jewish community in America is that it is a community that is intellectually vigorous and morally grounded. And after the smoke clears in the debate, I think people ultimately make honest assessments and judgments about what is been true, and I think that they will find that this deal is exactly as I presented it. Keep in mind that two years ago, when we set up the Interim Agreement that allowed us to negotiate for a comprehensive deal while ensuring that Iran was not just stalling, some of the same critics said this will never work, Iran will cheat, this is terrible. Two years later, it is worked exactly as it was supposed to. Even those former critics acknowledged that for the first time in a decade, Iran actually did not make progress on its nuclear program, and in fact, in some cases, reversed it. And I think the same thing will happen with this deal people will look back and say as long as we implemented it with care and precision that it was the right thing to do. The one thing I do want to make sure is that your readers and everybody who cares about the U.S.-Israeli relationship retain the understanding that I think is one of the foundations of this relationship, which is, is that this is not a partisan issue; the bipartisan support of Israel is critical to a strong U.S.-Israeli relationship. And I have been troubled by some of the activities that have taken place up in Congress because I think that it has sometimes involved politics rather than policy. Are you referring to the Prime Minister's speech? Well, I have said before I do not think that was the wisest thing to do. If I had gone to the Knesset and actively lobbied members on a position that was contrary to the Prime Minister's position, I suspect that some eyebrows would have been raised inside of Israel. But the fact that there were a number of in fact, maybe the majority of Republicans announced their opposition to the Iran deal before the deal was actually posted and they could read it I think indicates the degree to which sometimes politics gets involved in this. That is not good for anybody. And so, look, I probably would not be sitting in this Oval Office were it not for the incredible support that I received from the Jewish community throughout my political career from my very first race in the state Senate coming out of Hyde Park in Chicago, to my Senate run, to my presidential run. It is not just that I have received votes from the Jewish community; it is that I have received ideas, values, support that helped shape me into the person I am. And the friendships that I have are ones that will last me a lifetime and those include friendships with people who are opposed to this deal. So does it hurt you personally when people say that you are anti-Semitic? Oh, of course. And there is not a smidgen of evidence for it, other than the fact that there have been times where I have disagreed with a particular Israeli government's position on a particular issue. And I have said before, and I will continue to say, that if you care deeply about Israel, then you have an obligation to be honest about what you think, the same way you would with any friend. And we do not do anybody, any friend, a service by just rubber-stamping whatever decisions they make, even if we think that they are damaging in some fashion. And the good news is that the people I am close to, the people who know me, including people who disagree with me on this issue, would never even think about making those statements. I get probably more offended when I hear members of my administration who themselves are Jewish being attacked. You saw this historically sometimes in the African American community, where there is a difference on policy and somebody starts talking about, well, you are not black enough, or you are selling out. And that, I think, is always a dangerous place to go. These are hard issues, and worthy of serious debate. But you do not win the debate by suggesting that the other person has bad motives. That is I think not just consistent with fair play; I think it is consistent with the best of the Jewish tradition. All right? Thank you. One last question. One of my daughters wants to know, what is your favorite bagel flavor? I was always a big poppy seed guy. Poppy seed. So the poppy seed bagels at H&H Bagels which somebody told me they closed They closed. It is closed, yes. Which is shocking. My school was a block from H&H bagels. I mean, I would walk down from Columbia. Columbia just to get H&H bagels on Saturdays or on the weekends. And what do you like on a poppy seed? Just a schmear. Just a schmear. Lox and capers okay, but generally just your basic schmear.

{"id": 382, "text": "You have always talked about having fun as a key to business. Are you having fun? I am having fun. I am enjoying it. We are accomplishing a lot. Your stock market is at an all-time high. Your jobs, your unemployment is at the lowest point in almost 17 years. We have fantastic numbers coming out. And I think we will have, over the course of the next, fairly short period of time, and more importantly over a long period of time, we are going to have great numbers coming out of our country. What is your personal thought? I enjoy success. And we are having tremendous success, as a country. We have some difficulties with respect to North Korea, the Middle East. I inherited-- and I have said it often--I inherited a mess. The country was having many different problems. Among them, the Middle East, ISIS, which we have done more with respect to ISIS in nine months than we have done in nine years. But we have really done, we have done, I would say eight months in eight years, to be specific. But we have done a really, really good job with the military. We are building up our military. We just had an over $700 billion budget, which will be approved. We are , you know, there is been few times where the military was more important than what it is right now. And, in addition to that, which is by far the overriding element, it is lots of jobs in the United States. So, what the country is doing, we are doing very well. And on an economic front, we are doing very well. Now that we are almost a year from the big upset and the big win, do you think your business background prepared you for this job? And were you ready, now that you have a year in? Well, I think it helped. It is certainly a different kind of job than, really there is anywhere. Because you have so many skills necessary. But certainly the campaign was successful. What people do not realize is that I spent much less money than Hillary Clinton. So right there, perhaps that is business. You know, if you look at the numbers it is astronomically different. Yeah. I do not think anybody's ever written that. You know, in the old days, if you spent less money and won, that was supposed to be a good thing. Today nobody talks about it. But I spent much less money and won. I think that is --so we start off there--I think that was good. I also think that, yes, being in--just last night I had dinner with all of our generals and admirals, at the highest level. You probably saw that. Yeah, I saw the picture right here. Yeah. It was lovely. It was fantastic. But I talked about business. I said, Your equipment is coming in too slowly and at too great a cost. And I actually got involved in negotiating, as an example, the F-35 fighter with Lockheed. You may call Marillyn , the head of Lockheed, who you know, I think. Mhmm. And she is a terrific person. But I developed a bidding system between Boeing and Lockheed. And I was able to reduce the price of the Lockheed by billions of dollars. By billions of dollars. And this took me, actually, a very small amount of time. And I read a story, and this when I was president-elect, had not come here yet. And I called the military. I said, What is the problem? We met with the generals. I then met with Lockheed. I then--the generals were unable to get anything off the price. And in fact, they wanted to raise the price and claim extras. And I met with Marillyn , from Lockheed. I then went and had a very frank discussion with her. I then met with Boeing, and I said, Well, we are going to come out with a competing plane. And then went back to her. And I went back and forth. And the end result is billions and billions of dollars have been taken off the cost of the plane. Well, again, you are negotiating with them. You have obviously a lot of negotiation skills that you bring. And that is one thing. There are many, many things that I was too late into the game for the President Gerald Ford aircraft carrier. But it took too long to build, and it was way over budget. And you know, those things, we are being much more conscious as a country about things such as that. So you have had pain points in business, obviously. Well, I do not know. If you-- Pain points? In other words, obstacles that you have to overcome. Oh, sure. You always have obstacles. So, if you take away the politics of being president, and what you are trying to do with the economy, what are the obstacles that you are finding that you necessarily did not find in your business life? Well, you have Congress. That is a big obstacle in many cases. You have, in some cases, well-meaning people in Congress that truly feel strongly about something. And I understand that and actually do not mind that. And then of course you have grandstanders and others that want to try and make a point or want to do something that really is not necessarily in the best interests of the country. And those people I fight. And what people do not know is that I have had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that is ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I am not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I am talking about bills. We have had a tremendous amount of legislation passed. Like VA accountability, which nobody could get passed. Meaning people are accountable now, because before you could not do anything if you caught people who worked there doing very bad things. But many, many bills have been passed. And now we are going for taxes. I will get health care. I am one vote short of health care. I will get health care. And I think block-granting it back to the states is going to be a great thing to do. I think it'll be great for the people. Smaller government, great for the people. They will be able to handle it better. But we are one-- Are you talking about the Graham-Cassidy bill? Yeah, I like it very much. I do. I like it. It is block-granting. It is granting the money back to the states. Right, right. And you have a smaller form of government that is going to be able to do--if they do a proper job--that will be able to do. There are certain states where they are very well run. And I could name them. I could name certain states where they really--they will do miracles with that money, in terms of health care. It will be far better than it is. Because Obamacare has failed, badly. So I am working on that now. But we actually, I would say, I either have the votes or I am one vote short. And I believe we will get health care done sometime prior to the election. With Obamacare, until you come up with something different, do not you feel there is a lot of things going on with Obamacare right now, where, do not you feel you need, as CEO of America, an obligation to make it run as good as it can while it is still the law of the land? Well, that is an interesting, that is a very interesting question. It is a failed concept. It is thousands and thousands of pages. It is been amended by additional thousands of pages. It is a total mess. The premiums are going up, you know. But while it is still the law, do not you think, you know, we are cutting back on advertising, we are shrinking the window of signing up, so-- Well, we are actually, what we are doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it is failing. I mean the insurance companies are fleeing and have fled. They fled before I got here. But with that being said, no, Obamacare is Obama's fault. It is nobody else's fault. In fact, if you go back to-- Yes, but now it is your administration's responsibility. Yes. But I have always said Obamacare is Obama's fault. It is never going to be our fault. With that being said, I think the Democrats want to make a deal. At the same time, I think I have a deal with the Republicans. So I have the best of both worlds. That is business to a certain extent-- Right. --when you asked the business question. And as you have noticed, I am very able to make deals with Democrats if I have to. Who have you found so far are better deal-making partners, the Ryan-McConnell set or the Pelosi-Schumer set? Well, the Republicans have something called the filibuster rule. Which is a disaster. And if they do not get rid of that, it is always going to be very tough for them. You know what that is. Yes, well, of course. The filibuster rule is-- It is a disaster when you are in the majority. It is a friend when you are in the minority. Well, you need eight Democrat votes every time. I mean, they literally need eight Democratic votes. And, they keep it for the sake of history. But history is that, in 1789, when it all began, what it actually, when they started voting, it was 1789, the first votes, that was a simple majority. And we should go back to a simple majority. If we had the filibuster rule, if we had the 60 votes for Justice Gorsuch, he would not be sitting on the bench right now because for the judges that has been taken off. And part of my plan is that the Democrats would take it off in two minutes. And the Republicans-- Well, they did not when they had a majority. Well, they were going to. Well, they did it for the judge. Do not forget, 95 percent of that work was done before we got there. So I think the filibuster rule is very bad. At the same time, I think if we pass taxes, I think we will have health care and taxes before. I believe we will have a great infrastructure bill before, which is easiest of all of them. In fact, I think I will have more Democrat votes for infrastructure than I will Republican votes. And I also have another bill that I think will be very--an economic development bill, which I think will be fantastic. Which nobody knows about. Which you are hearing about for the first time. But I am going to do that. But before-- What is that? What does that mean? Economic development incentives for companies. Incentives for companies to be here. Incentives for companies to do things. What kind of incentives? And it'll be a great bill. It is something I have had. I just do not want to do it before I do health care-- So business, like Carrier? Business incentives to create jobs, keep jobs? So that when companies leave our country, they get penalized severely. So that when companies stay in our country, they are incentivized. But there will not be any more companies, and it is really stuck. I hope you have seen--again, this is an interview where I am doing the talking, I guess--but I hope you have seen that companies are moving back into our country. You saw Toyota, five plants. Other companies, car companies are moving back into our country. They are expanding their plants. So is it a carrot-- We have a lot of-- So is it a carrot to get companies to stay and/or grow? Or is it a stick that you penalize? It is both. It is both. It is both a carrot and a stick. It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so--if you leave, it is going to be very tough for you to think that you are going to be able to sell your product back into our country. How comfortable are you, as a businessperson, having the government involved in a business decision about where a company wants to locate? And where a company wants to put jobs. Very comfortable, because there is no tax if you stay. There is no tax. We have to protect our companies. And if you looked at what is happened, they have been ravaged by the stupidity of politics and, frankly, the stupidity of politicians. They have been ravaged. And we have to protect our companies. We have to protect our workers. And the only way you are going to do that is you have to create rules. I mean, when you talk about, ENTITY, when you talk about fairness, do you think it is fair that some countries charge us 100% tariff, or tax, to sell a product in their country? And yet the same product coming out of that country coming into our country comes into our country for no tax. See, that makes it unfair for our companies. And what I want to do is reciprocal. See, I think the concept of reciprocal is a very nice concept. If somebody is charging us 50 percent, we should charge them 50 percent. Right now they charge us 50 percent, and we charge them nothing. That does not work with me. You are also taking steps with the corporate tax rate. Which I think there is a lot of consensus on that. Yes. In terms of the individual tax code, you campaigned on tax reform that does not increase the deficit. Are you sticking with that? Yes. This will not increase, this will lower the deficit, because I think we are going to take off like we have never taken off before. This is going to bring jobs back. This is going to bring $3 trillion dollars back. The corporate tax cuts. Yeah, well, the offshore money. Offshore money, right. That is part of it. But in terms of individual tax-rate reform, without spending cuts, even with dynamic scoring, it is going to increase the deficit. So are you committing to then having offsetting-- Yes. --spending cuts? First of all, we are going to have some spending cuts, okay. We are going to really have some spending cuts. But I will tell you that most of what we are going to do is we are going to gain. Look at GDP. So GDP last quarter was 3.1%. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number. He hit 3%. He hit three a couple quarters. He never hit it on a yearly basis. Never hit it on a yearly basis. That is eight years. I think we will go substantially higher than that. And I think this quarter would have been phenomenal, except for the hurricanes. The hurricanes were very very--actually there was some really good things on the jobs report that just came out. You saw. Yep, yep. The hurricanes had a huge impact on and, you know, as soon as I saw the first hurricane I said, That is bad. Then I saw the second, the third, the fourth. But the hurricanes will have an impact of, could even be a point. I was saying a half a point, could even be a point. But that is somewhat artificial. Now, we are going to have some great success. What I am saying, though, is that the tax cuts will spur business. Companies will stay in our country--they will not be leaving. Companies will be hiring people. They will be expanding. They will be building new plants, and that is what it is all about. It will be a great spur, so through growth, our deficits will come down. Last week you said twice, both on the South Lawn and in Indiana, that you will not personally benefit from this new tax reform. Do you still hold to that? Well, what I say is that the, this whole concept, everybody benefits if the country does well. We all do. You guys benefit. Everybody benefits if the country does well. We are the highest-taxed nation in the world--now some people like to say developed nation, but I have not found too many that are higher. We are the highest-taxed developed nation in the world, probably the highest-taxed nation in the world. It makes it very uncompetitive when you are paying 42 and 44%, if you start including state taxes and other things that many businesses have to, depending on what state they are in, and in China you are at 15% and in other countries you are at numbers far lower than that. So, we are bringing it to 20, I was thinking in terms of 15. The corporate tax, the corporate tax rate. Actually. The corporate tax rate. I was actually saying 15 for the purpose of getting to 20. Right. But it was a spread that I did not like. You know I did not want to be talking about, so we started at 20 with the understanding I am not negotiating. I actually wanted the 15, so that, because as you know, this will be a negotiation-- Sure. --for the next 30 days. But in terms-- But I wanted the 15 in order to get to 20. But in terms of the tax reform and what is on the table so far, there is a lot of people saying, Oh, Trump's not as rich. You are worth many billions, we have looked at you for decades, and we all know that. The estate tax, the death tax ... Did you say Trump's not as rich? What? No, other people are saying that. We say Trump's worth billions. You say you are worth more than we estimate, but the point is, if the estate tax in the current plan is going away, that is more than a billion dollars, even on our number, that benefits you. How do you square that and being able to sell that to the American people? Well, we are going to have to see what happens. We are going to have to see what happens. The estate tax is for many, many family companies where people are forced to sell their businesses. That includes farms. But it includes a lot of businesses, any business--not even small businesses only. Large businesses also, where the estate tax is so onerous that families are forced to sell and some cases have fire sales and not get proper pricing. And in many cases, those businesses do not do very well after the family leaves. So that is the primary reasoning behind the estate tax. But we will be talking about estate tax. We will be talking about all of it. You know, it will be a very serious set of negotiations going on over the next period of time. But the estate tax is really for those businesses, of which there are many, that are forced to go out of business or forced to sell for that reason. Yes, but you could raise that threshold higher. I think the point that for someone like yourself, as president--the first businessman president--how do you push forward a bill that would, right now, as written, give you and your family more than a billion dollars' worth advantage just on that clause alone? Well, the big advantage that I would get is if the economy does well. That is a great thing for me--politically and otherwise. But the economy is a very--you know it is very interesting, ENTITY. I built a great business, but it does not mean anything to me. My children are running it. It does not mean anything to me anymore. I do not even think about it because this is so big, what I am doing now, so big and so, so important because this country was going in the wrong direction. We were heading toward a really bad situation. And if you remember, when I got elected, the stock market dropped and then they heard my speech, and it dropped. And then it went up more than it dropped. It went down like 800 points, and then it went up a lot--whatever it was, much more than that. And then since then, it is gone-- Yeah, you are up 15, 20%. How much? Up 20%, right? No, 25 since the election. You have to go since the election. Depends which index, but yes. Since election day it is 25%. It has gone up since the Election Day $5.2 trillion--$5.2 trillion. If Hillary Clinton would have won, the markets would have gone down substantially. Instead of $5.2 trillion. It was interesting, I just saw the number today, $5.2 trillion. It was just announced that since election day, November 8, the markets have gone up $5.2 trillion dollars. They have gone up 25%. Because the Nasdaq was 26, et cetera, et cetera. One of your sons, I believe it was Eric, told Forbes that he would give you quarterly reports on the your business, on your former business. Is that happening? I have not seen a report. You know, I have, I built, I think the thing that I--look obviously people know I have been very successful but I built a truly great company with truly great assets and very little debt, and I do not think that is been recognized to the extent it should. And I do not care about it so much anymore because this is--you know, I am here. But do you talk? Do you check in on how they are doing? You know what? He may be doing quarterly reports. I have not seen any yet. I know he is , you know, he is doing a very good job because I know the kind of person he is. He is running it with Don. And they are doing a very good job, I would imagine. But it is very good stuff that they are running. Again, between your business success and then this big tax bill, do you think the American public has a right to know how you will personally fare with this new-- Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And then to that-- You see, you have to understand, if what I do is good for the middle class, that is also good for me, and then if I do what is good for the upper class, that is good for me. Do not forget--the companies that we are talking about--many people own some of these companies. And sometimes wealthy people own them, and sometimes poor people own them. But when we make life and business better for companies, that is a great thing for everybody, including me... . But people are dying to know if I have any benefit. Right. And I ask them, and I tell them, most important, this is a jobs bill. This is a jobs tax cut and reform. It is a tax cut. It is a massive tax cut. Right. Will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. It is a massive tax cut, and it is a reform. It is both. So it is a massive tax cut, but then that runs against your pledge to not increase the deficit because you cannot , you know. No, because, no, because a tax cut will spur growth. Yes, that is true, and there is dynamic scoring The growth, the growth will be so much that it'll be-- Yes, but history has shown that you cannot just cut. It does spur growth, but it will not pay for itself. History has shown that. Well, history has also shown the opposite. I mean, you have had it both ways. It has shown both ways. Which time have you been able to cut and out of growth cut-- Well, during Reagan, during Reagan, during his cuts, he--tremendous growth. It spurred growth, but it also ballooned the deficit. My feeling is that we are losing so much business, and so many companies are leaving our country, and so many companies are doing so badly. Look at our steel industry. Look what is happening with our steel industry. Now I am going to give them additional help, as you will see later from economic development plans, because we are not going to let these industries be taken advantage of by the other countries. What has happened and what will be happening is not only will we have massive tax cuts and reform. Not only will we have the largest regulation cuts in the history of a presidency--there has never been a president who has cut regulations anywhere even close, and I am not nearly finished. You know the ones I have done. And I am actually doing one next week, which will be massive. But we have cut. Now, I believe in regulation, by the way, but it is got to be reasonable regulation. It cannot take 21 years to build a highway-- Right. --to get approved. Right. It cannot take, to put up a structure someplace, 15 years before you find out that you are not allowed to build it. You know, that is what is been happening. You saw what I did with Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline, approved within 24 hours--approved. In fact, the one is now built, and the other one's under construction. Forty-eight thousand jobs. Now we are going to have massive growth. We are going to have massive job production. We are going to, I think very, very importantly, help the companies because I am going to be following this up with a bill that makes it more fair for our companies. One of the unfair, probably the--I will not even say the worst aspect, but one of the bad aspects--was taxes, but we have worse because some countries treat our companies so unfairly that it is almost impossible for them to compete. And we will be straightening that out in a different bill which will be coming, which I have never really discussed publicly very much, but which will be coming fairly soon after the tax cuts... . We have cut, we have cut regulations, or deregulation, but we have cut regulations more than any president ever in history, and it is not even close, and this is only nine months. And there is more coming. I do not know if you saw when I held up that highway chart a few months ago. Yes. Where it took anywhere from 17 to 21 years. We have highways that have been under negotiation for decades. Roads, bridges--you know you cannot build. Those days are over. We are trying to get it down to a maximum of 2 years, so that instead of 20 it'll be a maximum of 2. And, by the way, they may not get approved. But if they do not get approved, you are going to know fast. You are not going to be going 20 years and then find out you cannot build. So besides your own vision for the Trump Organization and the success that you provide, you have always said talent matters. Talent you bring in matters. How do you feel that you have done so far with managing the talent that you have brought in to your White House, to your administration? Well, I think you have different kinds of talent. I have some that is terrific, that is unknown to the public for the most part, that has been incredible. Who have been your biggest successes? I have had a lot. I hate to point them out because then when I do not point somebody out they are disappointed. And then I have had some that I have been disappointed in. I have had some that I thought would be very good that I am not as happy as I thought. But I have had some-- Examples? --I have had some disappointments. Excuse me? Example? Well, I do not want to use examples now, but I have had some that I am not, that I have not been happy with and that frankly right now I am not that thrilled with. I was disappointed. I thought they'd be better. And I have had some that turned out better than I thought. What did surprise you about the ones that did not turn out better? Was it-- You never know when to fire. You can meet somebody, and you can see somebody sitting in front of you, and you can even look at their record to a certain extent. Do not forget one of your early questions is: How does this compare with the business? Well, it is a different set of skills. You need more skill for this. And you need more heart. You also need more heart. Because a lot of your decisions here are based on what is good for people, not just what is good for the budget or what is good for the pocketbook. But, so it is, there are tremendous skill sets from the world of business that are great. But you need additional skill. You also need political skill-- Where-- And you need political instinct. People in business, many people in business have no political instinct, or you do not know if they do. But I have had people that I am extremely pleased with, that I actually think have been better than I would have thought. And I have had some--I mean for the most part I got it right--but I have had some that I am disappointed. I have had some that I am still disappointed. You are very public about that. Do you think that is a positive? Yeah, I think it is positive. I think people understand it. That is the way life is, sure. Where are you today with Secretary Tillerson? He came out of a great company. A company that has been around a long time. I do not mind opposing views, but he and I have some opposing views. I think we have to be a much, much stronger in stance. And, ultimately, my view matters. That is the way life goes. But I have a very good relationship with him. And generally speaking, we get along very well. There are reports out today over the last couple days about him calling you a moron privately. Has he talked, reached out to you about that? Do you believe that he said that? Well, we may have to, if he did that--which he says he did not , by the way, he said he did not . And they announced with the State Department that he did not . I think it is fake news, but if he did that, I guess we will have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win. You have had a lot of turnover, you have had-- But so does everyone else. Yeah, you know we-- Well, one of the biggest advantages that I have, that somebody like me has, is that I was not in politics, so I have not gotten to know Washington for 30 years. I do not know everybody here. I have had to make new relationships. So that is -- So was that hiring mistakes or was it management mistakes in terms of-- No, in some cases it was not a mistake. It might just be a different style. But overall I think I have got it right, and I think that there is always a lot of turnover, especially in the early years of a White House. But overall, I think I have a great group of people. Hicks: I just, I know you have a speaking engagement soon so just one or two more . What time is it, 12:30? That is all right. Feel free. Hicks: Okay Okay, thanks. A lot of your appointments--you say this, and it is true--it has taken you longer to get them through the Senate, but you have also made fewer -- No, no, no, it is not taking me longer. It is taking the Senate longer to confirm It is taking the obstructionist people. Absolutely right. But you have also made many fewer appointments than other presidents at this stage. Is that an intentional-- That is because I do not need as many people. And that has to do with business also. And I have said that loud and clear, but nobody wants to write it. So is it that you are not going to make those appointments, ever? I am generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be--because you do not need them. I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it is totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people. And you look at--so the appointments, I have made some great appointments. You take a look at the appointments we have made. But two things that nobody mentions that I think are very important: judges. I have many, many judges in the pipeline. Already we have had approved a number. Federal judges. I am not just talking about Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court, I am talking about many federal judges. And I will have approximately 145 federal judges. I am getting praised--right, I mean, are you disputing that? It is approximately 145. That does not include the court-of-appeals judges, which will be about 17. So we have had a tremendous amount of judges. Many are in the pipeline, and we are being praised for the quality of the people we are putting on the court system. That is a very big factor. In addition, so if you look already in nine months, numerous judges have already been approved. Many are in the pipeline. Others are now, as we speak, being chosen. And our system is working very, very well. We will have made a stamp on the court system the likes of which I do not think anybody has ever been able to do before, because we have so many. Who do you call, who do you pick up the phone and call and say, I need to talk. I have a question. Well, I have friendships, I have relationships. Largely the relationship is where I am--in other words, now it is very much of a Washington relationship. I deal with people here. It is a very fair question. I do like to call friends. I do not have much time, believe it or not. I am definitely a working president. I come in early. I start very early. Today I have already spoken to the head of France and the head of other countries. And you know, I mean, this is very much of a, in fact I have my actual working desk inside. This looks very nice, do not let that fool you. But more family, I think, than anything else. Plus I have some very good friendships in business. And I do like to get opinions. I am somebody that very much accepts opinions from people that I know understand what is going on in the world. Is it at times lonely? It is a lonely position, because the decisions are so grave, so big. If it is a big--like, if you buy airplanes, it is tens of billions of dollars. It is not like you are buying a plane. It is hundreds of billions of dollars. But that is not--the decision I made on Syria, for example, going in and firing 59 rockets, missiles, into Syria. When I had to give the go-ahead for that, that is a very hard decision to make. You do not know. Every one of them hit their target with incredible technology--Tomahawks in that case, but incredible technology. And I was actually sitting with the president of China at the time, having dessert in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago. But you know those decisions are tough decisions. It is lonely. And you have to make them yourself. And the military is--we have the greatest military. And by the way, our military is getting so much stronger, so much better. And rapidly. But I will tell you, you make those decisions all by yourself. Did business prepare you for that decision? No, nothing prepares you for that. Nothing prepares you for-- when you send missiles, that means people are going to die. And nothing really prepares you for that. So where are you and North Korea right now, and what is the endgame? You spent your whole life negotiating, but you have not left any room for negotiation. So where do we go? There is not that much room left. There is not that much room left. Look, this should have been taken care of by four or five previous administrations. It certainly should have been taken care of over the last eight years. And every year makes it a more difficult situation. And right now, I mean President Obama told me--sitting right there, the two of us. He said that the previous--in the meeting we had prior to my coming into the White House--he said that was his toughest decision. But I said, but you did not make a decision, because you did not do anything. You let it go on. I just, I feel strongly you cannot allow him to have nuclear weapons. And you have kind of shut off, again with Secretary Tillerson. You have told him, stop wasting his time with diplomatic-- He was wasting his time. Let us hypothesize that there could be a good-cop, bad-cop scenario. How can somebody who is under you be taken seriously as any kind of cop if his boss has undermined his authority? Well, I am not undermining. I think I am actually strengthening authority. But in the case of North Korea, they have been talking for 25 years. Obviously, that does not work. Similarly, you inherited a lot of deals. Iran, TPP, Paris ... TPP, I am very proud of the fact that-- But do not you think, just the question-- Yes. Do not you have an obligation as CEO of America, even if you do not agree with these deals, to continue some of these deals-- No. Otherwise every administration is just undoing each other's deals. Well, TPP was not a signed deal. It would have been a disaster. It would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA, which is a disaster. I inherited the NAFTA. It is a disaster for this country. A lot of business loves, thinks NAFTA has been great, so-- No. You take a look at your car manufacturing plants, go down to Mexico. Hicks: Just two more minutes, we are wrapping up. Five more minutes. If you take a look at your car manufacturing plants, ENTITY, NAFTA has been a disaster for manufacturing in this country. We have lost so much of our car business to Mexico. NAFTA is a disaster as a deal. Now we are renegotiating it. I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we are going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you cannot negotiate a good deal. It is a terrible deal for our country. It is been a terrible deal. It was a mistake. TPP would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA. It would have been a disaster. It is a great honor to have--I consider that a great accomplishment, stopping that. And there are many people that agree with me. I like bilateral deals. But we are in a multilateral-- We would have gone into a hornet's nest. No, no, but you can have it this way and do much more business. And if it does not work out with a country, you give them a 30-day notice, and you either renegotiate or not. But TPP would have been a disaster for the country. Well, let us look at it differently. I also took things and made them happen that were not going to happen, like the big pipeline deals. Those were deals that were not going to happen--48,000 jobs. Those were deals that were not going to happen that I made happen, and I made them happen immediately. Is there a focus on deals versus policy? We are in a multilateral world--at least take something like the Marshall Plan or foreign aid. Are you still talking about cutting foreign aid even though a lot of people acknowledge that the Marshall Plan was actually great for America overall? As a single deal, it might not look great, but as a policy, it was incredibly effective. For me, it is America first. We have been doing that so long that we owe $20 trillion, okay? It is America first. We have to build up our country. I got elected. It is called Make America Great Again. We have debt. We have deals going. I mean, the deal we made, as an example, the trade deal we made with South Korea, is a terrible deal. We are renegotiating it. It is a terrible deal, and we are renegotiating that deal right now. At the same time, we are helping them militarily. But they have to treat us fairly, and other countries have to treat us fairly. As an example, we defend Saudi Arabia. I am very good friends with many of the people in Saudi Arabia, including the king. I have great respect. Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country. Why are we defending them, and not being properly taken care of economically? It does not make sense. Nobody ever thought of it. There are many countries that are extremely wealthy that we defend. Why are we defending them, and spending money to defend them, and they are not reimbursing us properly and fully? And I am doing that. At the same time, we will have better relationships than we have right now. You know, I have very good relationships with the leaders of countries. In terms of Russia, the Department of Homeland Security reached out to 21 states and confirmed that Russia was meddling with their elections. Do you think Russia meddled in the U.S. election in 2016? Well, they just announced that there was no vote change, number one. I do not think the question has ever been messing with the total tally. Really it is been influence. They just said there was no change in vote. They just said that. They also just said that there has been absolutely no collusion. They just said that. Yesterday. Two days ago. Senate. There has been no collusion. I did not speak to Russians. Everyone knows that that was just a statement put out by the Democrats so that they could have an excuse for losing an election that in theory they should have won because it is very easy for the Democrats to win the electoral college. And not only did not they win, it was 306 to--what was it?--223, if you could get the right number. It was 306 to 223. That was an excuse for the Democrats not winning the election. But now that you are in this seat, does it bother you that the Russians tried to meddle with the election? It would bother me greatly if that is the case. It would bother me greatly. And I look forward to seeing what the final reports are. And hopefully they will come out soon, so if there are suggestions, we can do those suggestions prior to the '18 election. But it has been taking so long, all of the various studies and reports, but I would like to see what everybody comes up with, so that we can, if there is something to do with respect to the '18 elections, which are right around the corner, we will have time to do it. Do not forget, we have those elections now in about a year. There is not that much time. So I would like to see that, because I do not want Russia messing with our elections, nor do I want anybody or any other country messing with our elections, that is for sure. Hicks: I am so sorry, we do have to wrap up. If you have one closing question to just kind of tie everything together. So Las Vegas, hurricanes--nothing like that happened in your business of that magnitude. What were you able to bring from your former business career that helped you deal with that kind of thing? Well, I have gotten very high marks for the hurricanes. And I think I really feel that the reason is because of what I have done, to a certain extent, in business. We mobilized. I put some excellent people in charge of FEMA. We have some excellent people that I worked with. We had fast mobilization. We had mobilization before the hurricanes even hit, which other people did not do. You probably noticed that in terms of signing emergency orders, they were signed immediately as opposed to waiting for long, long periods of time, and then, by that time, it was too late. And you had catastrophes that had lasting damage. I think, yeah, I think that there is a natural business instinct for that. And we worked closely with the governors, and we have had some really great governors to work with. Governor of Texas. The governor of Florida. We have really had some, I think, great relationships, but the mobilization went very, very well. And you look at what is going on in Texas. They are rebuilding. They are going to be back very soon. Florida is going to be back, way ahead of schedule. I have done a very good job in Puerto Rico--have not been given the same kind of credit, but if you speak to the governor of Puerto Rico and other representatives, you will see that they were thrilled. Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands--people do not even talk about it, but the governor of the Virgin Islands, Governor Mapp, gave us an A+. He said the job we have done has been incredible. He said that yesterday, very officially. Governor Mapp. Kenneth Mapp, terrific guy. But yeah, we have gotten very high marks for that. Then we had the tragedy in Las Vegas, which is a whole different thing. That was a very, very sad occurrence. I was there. I was in the hospitals. I met some incredible people, though horribly wounded. They were horribly wounded. But it, in one sense, taught me how great our country is, the fact that they can get back on their feet so quickly Thank you. Yeah. We have some great--the people of this country are just great. I mean, more than anything else, all of the hurricanes, the Las Vegas tragedy, it teaches me how great the people of our country are. Do you support these initiatives about the bump stock? Oh, we are going to look at that very closely. This has just come up. And we are going to take a look at that very closely. Last question, related to what ENTITY just said, you have pretty much never had a boss. In some ways, now you do have a boss--the American people. How has this changed? I have about 330 million bosses. Right. So how has this changed how you operate as an executive? It does not change, because all I want to do is the right thing. You will see that I will make decisions that are not politically popular, but they are the right thing to do. So I do have all 330 million bosses, but it does not matter, because I am going to do the right thing. I think that is another thing that maybe you will do more as a businessperson than you would as a politician. A politician is going to do the politically correct thing. I am going to do the right thing for the country. Hicks: Thanks guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you, ENTITY.

{"id": 203, "text": "First of all, let me say that I am delighted to be joined here by the Foreign Minister of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Ambassador to Greece to formally congratulate these two countries on the agreement they signed yesterday in New York, agreeing to normalize their relations. I want to say a special word of thanks to a great American, Cy Vance, who is here, who represented the United Nations; and my Special Envoy, Matt Nimetz, for the remarkable role they played in bringing these two countries together. As you know, the United States has had troops stationed, since I became ENTITY, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to try to help to prevent the spread of the Balkan war. And for these two countries to work out their longstanding differences and look forward to relationships of permanent peace and commerce and accord with one another is an enormous step forward in our attempts to find a comprehensive peace in the Balkans. Now, I also want to tell you that we have some reason to hope that we are making progress, thanks to the determination of NATO and the United Nations, in securing Bosnian Serb compliance with the conditions the U.N. and NATO have set forward for the cessation of the bombing campaign. And we are working on that, will continue to work on it hard today. And obviously, if there are any developments, we will announce them. Do you have Russian acquiescence to place troops around Sarajevo? Well, let me say, first of all, we are working on the details of the agreement. When they are worked out, we will then say what they are and answer all the questions. But sir, is there an agreement for the Serbs to pull their artillery from the positions around Sarajevo? That is what we are attempting to secure at this moment. We are working through that. There is been some progress in the last there is been some reason to hope for progress in the last several hours, beginning last night our time. But we are not prepared to make a final announcement yet. When we are, we will, and we will answer all the questions. The Speaker of the House today said that the Democratic position on Medicare is to scare 85-year-olds, and he called the party morally bankrupt. Well, you know, I think it is questionable to use words like morally bankrupt, but let us look at the facts. For 2 years, I said the Medicare Trust Fund was in trouble, and Mr. Gingrich and others mocked me and denied that it was in trouble. All by ourselves, with no help from them, we added 3 years to the life of the Trust Fund. We have proposed legislation which would add 10 years to the life of the Trust Fund and will get Medicare out of trouble. I do not want to use a term like morally bankrupt, but I think it is morally questionable at least to propose vast Medicare cuts which would increase the cost of Medicare to elderly people living on under $24,000 a year and claim that it is going to the Trust Fund when they know not one red cent of the money being paid by seniors will go to the Trust Fund. It will go to fund a tax cut that is too big. And they should tell the truth to the American people that they want to charge the providers more money and put that in the Trust Fund. They want to charge the elderly people of this country more money and put that into the tax cut. Now, that is the truth. And if we are going to talk about what morality requires, morality requires them to tell the truth to the American people.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspriordiscussionswithrepresentativesfromgreeceandtheformeryugoslav", "title": "Remarks Prior to Discussions With Representatives From Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-discussions-with-representatives-from-greece-and-the-former-yugoslav", "publication_date": "14-09-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 305, "text": "ENTITY, it is 2 days to go until the deadline in Northern Ireland obviously a crucial week, the politicians still at loggerheads apparently. What is it that you want them to do now in this make-or-break time? I want them to remember how strongly the people voted for peace and for the Good Friday accords and to find an honorable resolution of the admittedly thorny problems. Because whatever the difficulties of going forward, they are very small compared to the difficulties of letting the peace process fall apart. Now, you say there are thorny problems, and that is the difficulty and especially the problem of decommissioning. Would you be urging the Sinn Fein to do what Ulster Unionists are urging Sinn Fein to do, to namely sign up to a timetable for disarmament and give a categorical assurance that the IRA will have disarmed completely by May 2000? I think that all the parties should fully comply with the terms of the Good Friday accords, and that is what I would say. I think that they all have to find a way we know what the problems, the legitimate problems the Sinn Fein have with the decommissioning issue. But it is an important part of the Good Friday accords, so there has to be a resolution of it that enables the leadership of the Unionists, Mr. Trimble and the others who have fought for peace, to survive, to sustain their position, and to go forward and get everybody on their side to honor the Good Friday accords, too. They can find a way to do this if they decide that the price of failure is far higher than the price of compromise. And I think there is a good chance they will do it; even if it is 11th hour, I do. Well, what about the Ulster Unionists? Their position has been that there has to be guns handed over, actual hardware, before Sinn Fein can go into government. Do you think they should be considering moving ahead on the basis of pledges rather than actually looking for the armaments? Well, I believe that on that score, Mr. Trimble is satisfied in these talks with whatever commitment is made, and I think they should give it a chance to work. One thing I would say to the Unionists is that they can always walk away from this if the commitments are not made at a later date. And they should keep in mind they can bring this down at any time by simply walking out if the commitments are not kept. So I think that if Mr. Trimble can be satisfied and they can work it through, then I would hope the Unionists would support him and give him a chance give this thing a chance to work. Now, this political deadline is also coinciding with the annual deadline that there is in Northern Ireland of the Drumcree march. As we speak, an announcement on the Drumcree march is imminent. There are extremely strong indications that the Orangemen will not be allowed to go down the Catholic section of the Garvaghy Road. How concerned are you about what the impact of a refusal to let the Orangemen go down Garvaghy Road could be, both on the streets and on the political process? Well, as an outsider, you know, to me this looks like the most difficult of decisions because it is there is enormous emotional content on both sides. It is not just a matter of a lot of people walking on a certain road. And I think however it is resolved this year, the most important thing is that the parties themselves try to find a larger, omnibus resolution for this that reflects the spirit of the Good Friday accords. Keep in mind, I mean, the spirit of the Good Friday accords is that both sides should have respect for and get respect from one another, and that no one should have to give up his or her heritage or traditions, but they should be pursued with some sensitivity to how others feel as well. So I think that they are in a terrible bind now because the Drumcree deadline is coming up against the negotiation deadline. And so, however it is resolved, I think that what the leaders should be thinking about is, what is the long-run resolution of this? How can we show one another the necessary respect and sensitivity that will put this marching issue in the context of the commitment of the Good Friday accords, which is to push toward reconciliation and equality within the principle of consent? At the time of the Good Friday agreement, you waited up through the night in Washington, inside the White House, seeing how the negotiations were working out. You went on the phone personally and spoke to the main parties and tried to coax them forward. This week, with a new deadline, are you willing to do the same, to intervene personally? Oh, absolutely. I will do what ever I can to help. You know, this means a lot to me. It means a lot to the American people. We have tens of millions of Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants who are deeply invested emotionally, and many of them financially, in Northern Ireland, and would like to be more involved. And I also believe, as I have said many times, that if this can be resolved if we can get over this next hurdle and go forward I think it will give courage to the advocates of peace in the face of religious and ethnic problems in other parts of the world. You know, we are just getting off the ground with our efforts in Kosovo. There are many difficulties there, and the accumulated grievances there, from mass killing and mass uprooting, are deeper, if you will, just in terms of human loss than all the things that have happened in Ireland. But people have this sense that the divisions in Ireland go back such a long time, that if they can be overcome, I think it would give great heart to the proponents of peace in the Balkans and Africa and the Middle East, because the new Prime Minister is about to announce a government there; we have a chance again to make progress and peace in the Middle East. And I think that from my point of view, as someone who is interested in not only the country of my roots but the rest of the world, I think that it is hard to overstate; it is hard to overstate the impact a positive or a negative outcome could have on such actions in the rest of the world. Finally, ENTITY, there is only so much that you or, indeed, the British and Irish Prime Ministers can do to coax people along. Is this the time when Northern Ireland's political leaders have to stand on their own two feet? Well, I think they can know that we can coax them, and we can stand with them, and we can support them, and we can bring them benefits in all kinds of ways after this is resolved. But in the end, the leaders have to decide. Their people have voted for peace. But that is a general principle; the particulars are always difficult. And again, I would say, I think the important thing is to keep this going. Somebody if there is the necessary commitment given by all sides, and then, later, any of those commitments are not kept, this thing can always be brought down because the commitments were not kept. But I think it would be terrible to let it come apart now, before we get to see and feel how it really works. ENTITY, thank you very much.

{"id": 108, "text": "Good morning, ENTITY. Good morning. How are you? I am fine. How are you? I am all right. Let me ask you something. What the hell is going on down there in that White House? What do you mean, you have lost your focus? I have not lost my focus. You have just been seeing me through the foggy lens of television instead of the direct one of radio. There is a big headline in the Washington Post today, Clinton Wins Third Major Victory In Congress. I think we are doing fine. You know, we lost one bill, and a lot of people think it is like the last days of Pompeii. I mean, if you are going to fight for change, you have got to be prepared to lose a few as well as win some. But I think we are well on track. Let me just point out that when the Congress adopted my budget outline, it was the first time in 17 years that they'd adopted it within the legal time limit, faster than they have moved in 17 years. Everybody complained about the appointments process. When 100 days went by, it turned out I'd made more appointments during the period than my two predecessors did. We just passed the motor voter bill yesterday, a big issue for younger voters, making it easier for them to register to vote. We have got the economic program on track. I feel good about the way things are. But you know, change is not easy and people-if you want to keep score after 100 days, where we had 4,500 days of trickledown economics, you know, I have not done everything I meant to do in 100 days, but I never promised to do it in 100 days. I think we are doing fine. I think that looked good last night, breaking that Republican filibuster, because it looks like Bob Dole-it is like the Friday the 13th movies, you know, where you think you have finished him off and then next thing you know that hand comes popping up out of the lake there and, of course, in this case there was a pen in it. But this is an indication that it does not look like the Republicans are going to be able to waylay everything you are trying to do, does it? Well, I do not think so. You know, the filibuster on the jobs bill was an unusual thing, I think, not that they tried to do it but that they never let the majority vote. And I think the American people have got that figured out. And there are always going to be Republicans, or most always, that agree with some aspect of what we are doing. And when you reach out to them and you try to work out compromises, there are, almost always, there are some who want to go for the national interest over the partisanship, and that is what happened here. We worked out some problems with that motor voter bill, and it rolled right through. The same thing with family and medical leave. So I think if we just keep working at it, we will have some success. We have had 12 cloture votes-that is the attempt to get 60 percent of the Senate just so a majority can vote their will-12 already in the first 3 1/2 months. So I imagine they will make us do this a lot, but I think there are always going to be some Republicans who want to be part of a bipartisan movement for change, and I am encouraged by it. Or Republicans who want to be President. There are always going to be people who want to be President, and some days I like to give it to them. But if I did that, at least I'd have a telephone conversation with you before I give it up so you can call me President Bubba. See, I have been waiting for this all this time. Well, ENTITY, I do not know what you have heard about what is been going on in this program, but it is always been very respectful. And anything you have heard to the contrary would just be further evidence of the collapse of the intelligence community in this country. And I mean, these guys did not even know that the Berlin Wall went down until they saw it on CNN. So you cannot trust what you hear from them. I was talking to my friend Jeff Greenfield over at ABC, and he had a good observation. He said, is this economic program of yours tougher to sell now, you think, because for whatever circumstances you were not able to run on it? No, I do not think so. The difference in the program that we are advocating and the one I ran on over a 5-year period is not very great, but what happened was after the election-I want to emphasize this-after the election the Government came out-the previous administration-and said that the deficit was going to be $50 billion a year bigger than they had said before in 3 of the 4 years of the term that I now occupy. So I had to do more to cut the deficit, and we had to put that up front. And it is worked pretty well so far. You know, ever since we announced serious intentions to cut the deficit and were specific about it, interest rates began dropping very steeply, mortgage rates were at a 20 year low. You are going to have a $100 billion-that is a lot of money-in refinancing of home mortgages and business debt and other things which I think will really help the economy. But that meant we had to put off some of the plans or scale them back in the early going and put them back into the later years of my term to invest money in things that I think are also important. But we have got to get control of this deficit. It is been spinning out of control now, getting worse and worse for a dozen years, and we do not have the funds we need to invest in jobs to grow the economy, and I think it is very important. I think William Greider pointed it out in Rolling Stone-and you either agree with it obviously or do not -that during the campaign that the focus was on and the debate was on jobs. And it seemed that because of Bush cooking the books and not realizing that the deficit was going to be a little bit bigger than it was, that then the agenda switched to this 5-year plan to reduce the deficit. Let me ask you- But wait, let me make one point. I think they are two sides of the same thing. That is, if I did not think that reducing the deficit over the long run would help us to create more jobs and if I did not think we could also get some increased investment in new technologies and education and training and to rebuild our cities and to do these things that have to be done, I would not be doing this. I think they are two sides of the same coin. I think until we show we can get control over the Government's budget and we can make some spending cuts, as well as restore some of the tax loses that we had in the early years of the trickle-down revolution, I do not think we can get a job program going in the country. So I think this getting the deficit down is part of a long-term job growth strategy. Jobs are the issue; reducing the deficit is a means to get control of our economic future. The whole purpose of it is to put people to work. To talk about it just a second, this economic plan and some of these numbers that we see now suggest that the public is-about half, 50 percent of them do not think it is going to work. And let me tell you what filters down to people like me, you know, aside from the esoteric proposals and figures and stuff that many of us do not understand, but what we hear is that the numbers we hear is that, for every $3 and so in new taxes, we are looking at about a dollar or so in spending cuts. And there are some people that think the ratio's even higher than that. Is that accurate? No, no. But I will tell you, if you look at this thing over a 5-year period we have more spending cuts than we do tax increases. And that is true even though we have some targeted increases in investment, in education and training, and new technologies. Now, the people who argue this the other way, they play clever games. For example, if you are going to cut a program that is in place, you may have to phase in the cuts over a 5-year period; if you raise a tax, you can raise a tax immediately. You have got to look at this whole budget. In this budget we have more spending cuts than tax increases. We do have some spending increases, but if you do not believe that there are differences in different kinds of spending, I do not know what we can do. We have some spending increases to give a nationwide apprenticeship program to help retrain the work force. We have some spending increases to get into new technologies to make up for defense cuts because we are losing a lot of high-tech, highwage jobs. You know, up in Connecticut we have had a lot of employment dislocation because of defense cutbacks, but you have got a whole highwage work force that needs to have something else to do. And every other government in the world is investing in new technologies to try to create those jobs for their people. If we do not do it, we are going to be left behind. So we have to target some investments. But this budget has over 200 very specific budget cuts over the last budget adopted in the previous administration. And if you look-it is 5-year budget, that is what the law requires us to do, to adopt 5-year budgets-we have got more spending cuts than tax increases, and we should. Is it important what the ratio is? And if it is, what should it be, do you think? I mean, because that is the-you know, that is kind of the way we relate to it. Well, the issue is how many cuts can you get without pulling the economy into a recession. What do you have to cut, how many cuts can you get without unfairly cutting the elderly? The same people who say we do not have enough cuts are also often saying we should not cut what we are cutting. And the truth is, if you want to get to a balanced budget through spending reductions, the only way to do it now is to get control of health care costs, and that, basically, in the later part of this decade, if we can adopt a national health system and-you know, Hillary has been working on that with hundreds of others-and we can bring the Government's deficit down to zero, but you cannot do that overnight. And the biggest part of our deficit growth now is in health care costs and interest on the debt. We are not spending a bigger percentage of our income on Social Security-our national income-than we were 10 years ago. We are spending a smaller percentage of our income on Federal aid in education than we were 10, 12 years ago. What is happened now is we started cutting defense, but health care increases overcame the defense cuts. So what I am trying to do is to cut everything I can now, get health care costs under control and look toward not only cutting the deficit but bringing it down to zero over a multi-year period. You just cannot do this overnight. You know, we took the national debt from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in 12 years with a $300-plus billion a year deficit when I took office. You cannot just eliminate that overnight without having serious economic dislocations. You have got to do it in a disciplined way and take it down. There is already been some compromise with some members of your own party in Congress. Do you anticipate any more of that, or is it- Well, I think there have been some changes that make it better. After all, we put this plan on the table only 30 days after I had taken office, and I invited people to comment on it but to keep its essential features intact. That is, we had to have the spending cuts before I would agree to tax increases. The tax increases had to be largely progressive; that is, they ought to be on people at higher income levels whose tax rates went down in the 1980's while their incomes went up, that we ought to have a earned-income tax credit. That is taxpayer jargon for giving a tax break to working class people with children, particularly who would be especially hard hit by the energy tax, and that affects people with incomes up to about $29,000 a year, where they will get an offset on their income tax to make up for the energy tax. And there ought to be some incentives for investment in the American economy, either mine or some others. And we emphasize small business, and we emphasize new plant and equipment for big business. And those things are all going to be in the ultimate tax package. So I feel good about it. I think that, you know, the changes that are being made basically, at least so far the ones that have been discussed with me, do not in any way undermine the fundamental principles of the tax program and the spending cut program I laid out. There is a dramatic picture of you and an agonizing Lyndon Johnson on the cover of the current issue of Time magazine asking the question if Bosnia is going to be your Vietnam. One, let me ask you, do you think it has that potential? And two, what is the United States policy in Bosnia? Well, let me answer the first question. There are similarities to Vietnam in the sense that there is a civil war and there is a national dividing line, that is, between Bosnia and Serbia, which does not fully coincide with the ethnic cohesion of the Serbs in Bosnia and Serbia; same thing on the other end of the country with Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a very complicated thing. Those folks have been fighting with each other for a long time. There are also some differences, however. You have the continuation of a principle of ethnic cleansing that you did not have in Vietnam, people getting killed or raped just because of their religion, just because they are Muslims and because of their historic conflict in that area. And you have a United Nations resolution which has, in effect, given a military victory to the Serbians. That is, the U.N. imposed an arms embargo which had the effect of opening up for the Serbs the entire arms cache of the Yugoslav Army and denying weapons to the Bosnian Muslims and to a lesser extent, the Croatians. So the international community has been involved. The third and the big difference from the point of view of the average American is, I have made it very clear that the United States, unlike Vietnam, is not about to act alone. It should not act alone. This is a European issue. It is an issue for the word community to address. We have worked very carefully with our allies to make the sanctions tougher and to keep the pressure on to try to do two things: to try to contain the conflict and to try to put an end to the slaughter. And our policy is that it is in the United States national interest to keep this conflict from spilling over into a lot of other countries which could drag the United States into something with NATO that we do not want and to do everything we can with our allies to stop the slaughter and to end the fighting. And that is our policy. Our policy is not to do what we did in Vietnam, which was to get in and fight with one side in a civil war to assure a military victory. That is not what we are involved in. We are trying to promote a settlement, and we have signed on to a plan-two of the three political factions in that area have signed on to it, and we have committed ourselves to working with our allies. So the policy is very, very different than the policy the United States pursued in Vietnam. Any scenario, anyplace down the road-this may be a dumb question, but I ask a few that you see ground troops somehow getting involved there? Does it ever reach that point? Say all the allies get on board and- We believe that there could be a United Nations force which we could take part in that could help to enforce the peace agreement or keep the peace. We have been involved in peacekeeping operations of this kind in many places. But the United States is not going to unilaterally enter the conflict on the side of one of the combatants and do what we did in Vietnam. That is not our policy, and that is not what we are going to do. You know, I agreed with you when you said during the campaign that history has shown that you cannot , allow the mass extermination of people and just sit by and watch it happen, and that re, ally is driving this, is not it? Yes. It is a difficult issue. Let me say that when we have people here who've been involved in many previous administrations that are involved in national security including, obviously, a lot of people who were involved in the two previous ones-everybody I talk to believes that this is the toughest foreign policy problem our country has faced in a long time. And I am trying to proceed in a very deliberate way to try to make sure there is not a Vietnam problem here. But, also to try to make sure that the United States keeps pushing to save lives and to confine the conflict. I do not think we can just turn away from this. Just because we do not want to make the mistake we did in Vietnam does not mean we should not be doing anything. There are things that we can do, and we are trying to do more to try to push this thing toward a settlement. I, also think that in terms of our clear self-interest, in addition to the humanitarian issue, if we can stop this conflict from spreading, and it has powder-keg potential, that that is clearly in our interest. You know what I have always wondered, ENTITY, you read the editorials in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal and you read these op-ed pieces-do you ever read one of those and then call Al and say, Man, that is a good idea. Why do not we do that? Often. Actually, I do. Do you? Absolutely, I do. I also often read editorials that question our policies or op-ed pieces that question our policy, and I send it to the Vice President and to other people in the administration, and I say, If we do not have an answer to this we should not go on. This is the best case against our policy. What is our answer to it? I think that is important. You know I do not mind, frankly, I do not mind criticism. In fact, I welcome it when it is rooted in ideas, when people are questioning whether a policy is right or wrong. But what I try to do is to have a new spirit of possibility here. I want a sense that, you know, we stop all this sort of political give-and-take and real harsh partisanship and calculating personal advantage and just talk about the ideas and the issues at stake and try to keep our focus on what is best for the American people. We are really in a new and unchartered time in many ways. It is very exciting. There are, all kinds of economic opportunities out there for the United States, but there are also a lot of very, very stiff challenges that we have to meet. And I think in order to do the right thing, we are going to have to keep our minds open and our ears open and be willing to experiment and to try some things until we find a course that will clearly work, that helps to support the security of the American people. You know, I was talking at the beginning of our conversation, ENTITY-I was actually just kidding about this focus issue-but you know, what looked great was when you and Hillary went up to Capitol Hill and when you had that first town meeting in Michigan, and now you are-in Cleveland and Chicago and this telephone call. You know, it began to look for a time-I remember I was watching Willie Nelson and Neil Young out there at Farm Aid, and they were talking about you and Al Gore, and they said, What change? And I think, you know, from the outside looking in, it is like we had 8 years of watching old Reagan get on and off that helicopter, and we wanted to see you do stuff like this. And I think this is great, and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate you calling. But I would say this: Let us not wait until these approval ratings get down to single digits before you call me again, because- Let me tell you, one of the things I did, though, and you may think this is a mistake, but I mean-put yourself in my position. Partly, when I get out of focus with the people is when I am not communicating directly with them, when I am just answering other people's questions, and I am at the mercy of whatever is on the evening news. But I came to this city with a determination to work with the Congress and to try to get some things done. In the first 3 months, I thought that, having been out across the country for the last year and a half, I should spend a great deal of time in intense efforts to develop the economic package, a health care package, and to get the basis of our national security and foreign policy down so that I would have a framework to proceed in. Most of the time I have been here, I have spent on the economy and on health care. In other words, my time has been sharply focused. I do not think the American people know that because I have not been out here talking to you and people like you out there. But there is been a big difference between the way I have spent my time in the efforts of the administration and, I think, what the perception is. That is my fault, in a way, and I am going to get out and correct it. But I had to spend a couple of months, I think, just going to work in the office, getting the details down, working through the procedures, making. sure I understood how the thing worked. And now I can go back on the road and do the things that I think are important to connect the American people to their Government. And I recognize that that is my responsibility. Only the ENTITY can do that, and if I do not do it, it will not be done. I know, ENTITY, you are coming to New York this afternoon. Do you want to go to the Knicks game tonight, or- You are betraying you are all-sports radio. I know you are trying to convince your listeners that you know something about this. You are trying to get your approval ratings up on sports. I know that. Actually, I'd like to do it. But I am going to speak at the Cooper Union this afternoon. And then I am going to a Democratic Party event tonight. So I cannot go to the ball game, although I'd like to. I am a big baseball fan, as you know. Well, of course, this would be basketball, ENTITY. Oh, did you say Knicks? I thought you said Mets. No, nobody wants to see the Mets. Are you kidding? Let me tell you something. My wife grew up in Chicago as a Cubs fan. Once you get for a baseball team, you cannot quit it just because it does not win. Well- I thought you said Mets. No, I'd love to go to the Knicks game, but I am otherwise occupied. I watched two of those games last night on television. Do you think the American people would think less of me if they thought I stayed up late and watched basketball? No, I do not think that; in fact, I read you have been watching the Houston Rockets and the Clippers. You know, I will let you go here. Just one final observation that I thought was kind of funny. Did you see any clips of Strom Thurmond interviewing one of those gay sailors? Here he is-I do not know if you saw this or not, but he was saying, Have you seen a psychiatrist? - -and I thought, man, if I could be 90 years old and have it that together, there really is not any other goal. Let us hope the same happens for you, ENTITY. Since we are on an all-sports network, let me give Senator Thurmond a plug. He still works out for 50 minutes a day, and that is why he is still out there doing it. So if everybody listening to us will start spending 50 minutes a day taking care of themselves, a lot of them will be 90, 91 and still plugging away like Strom. May I ask you a question about your jogging? Sure. What are your mile splits? We have an estimate here that is right around 12 minutes. No. When I ran with the Boston Marathon runners, we ran a 5k, and this is allergy time for me so I have to start out slow. We ran the first mile in 9 minutes, the second mile in 8 minutes, and the third mile in 7 minutes. Man, that is a lot faster than I do it. When I run here in town, I average probably about an 8.5 minute mile. But I can run it faster. On Valentine's Day the Vice President and I did 2.5 miles in a Heart Association run at about 7.5 minutes a mile. That is terrific. ENTITY, thank you very much. Thanks for coming on, and good luck. Thanks.

{"id": 520, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for taking the time to do this with us. We know you have a busy schedule, and we appreciate the gesture. The first question: Dissidents in China recently issued many open letters hoping to meet you during your stay in China. Why you cannot meet them and what message do you want to send them now? Well first of all, I have determined to try to meet with as many different kinds of people as I can when I am in China, but I also want to make decisions based on what I think will maximize the impact of my trip for all the objectives, which include the advancement of human and political rights. One of the things we have pushed very hard for is the adherence of the Chinese Government to the U.N. Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which President Jiang has said he will sign in the fall, in September or October which, as you know, will among other things require China to begin to admit on a regular basis international observers to talk to citizens, including political dissidents, on a regular basis to try to make sure that they are not abused in the practice of their civil and political rights and that they begin to be integrated into the mainstream of society. I want this trip to advance that cause. And I will structure my meetings and also the meetings of all my staff people appropriately. But I am glad to see so many of these dissidents speaking out and feeling free to speak out. It is obvious that they have concluded, some of them probably at some risk to themselves, to do this. I do believe, as I told President Jiang when he was here, that free political speech and expression is plainly a precondition for any modern state. And over the long run, it is essential to the strength of a country. I mean, we live in an information age where people's ideas basically grow the economy. So I think that this is a long-term battle that we are all involved in, and I believe we are on the right side of it. And I think in the end, the Chinese will agree. But ENTITY, the dissidents say that it is disheartening for them that you are not taking this opportunity to make a statement by attempting to meet with them or the families of the Tiananmen students who fell. Well, I will make a lot of statements. I worked very hard to get a lot of the dissidents out of prison, and I will continue to work very hard on that. And I will do whatever I think will increase my impact. And I will not do anything that I think will actually undermine my ability to get real results. But keep in mind, we also have some other very important objectives right now. Not objectives we will sacrifice for our human rights agenda to but objectives that we will pursue in addition to that. We have very important nonproliferation concerns which have been given new urgency because of the nuclear tests in India and Pakistan. We have very important concerns about trying to stabilize the economic situation in Asia, which if it got out of hand could have an enormous destructive impact on hundreds of millions of people in China, and a number of other issues that we are working on. So, I will do my best to pursue all of our legitimate concerns and never to minimize the human rights issues, but I have to structure the way I spend my time on this trip in a way that I think is most likely to further the interests of the United States as well as the values we have that we want to and the things we are trying to do for Chinese people. ENTITY, when you are being welcomed in the Great Hall of the People adjacent to Tiananmen Square, will the image of the one lonely man standing in front of a tank trying to prevent it from mowing down students in Tiananmen Square flash through your mind even for a second and cause a twinge because you have accepted the invitation to be welcomed? Well, first of all, I have thought about that one man a lot. I think that is one of the obviously one of the most vivid pictures of the last 20 years that anyone has seen. But I think it is important for me, if I am going to go to China, to not expect that just because I am the American I should be greeted in any fashion different from any other world leader that would be greeted there. And even I noticed that many people, including the Dalai Lama and Wang Dan and others have said, You know, you should go. You should be received in the way that the Chinese have always received world leaders. That is been the center of their Government for hundreds of years now. And you should speak your mind about human rights, religious rights, political rights. I think that is the right thing to do. I do not think we should confuse ceremony with substance here. I think that for me to say when I invite someone to the United States, our welcoming ceremonies, unless there is some physical reason to move it, for example, the back lawn is covered, it is always at the back lawn of the White House unless it is bad weather or unless the whole lawn is covered with something else. I could not very well invite someone to the United States and say, Well, I would like for you to come see me on a state visit, but I will not let you come to the back lawn of the White House. And I think that it is important to distinguish here between hundreds of years of history that has occurred at that spot and within those walls, of which what happened at Tiananmen Square is definitely a part, but it is not the only thing that is ever occurred there. And I think that it would be wrong for me to expect the Chinese Government to change the way they welcome all world leaders. On the other hand, it would be equally wrong for me to go there and take no notice of the continuing difficulties with human and political rights. So I expect to honor the ceremony, and I expect to advance what I believe in there and what America represents. The Chinese Government has officially denied the visa of three of us. If the administration cannot negotiate successfully over such an issue, how do people expect that your Government come up successfully with the other complex issues as the human rights issue? Well, for one thing, visas are normally not negotiable by anybody. We do not negotiate with anyone else over who gets a visa to the United States. Our problem is that you were denied visas, we believe, for the wrong reasons. I supported the establishment of Radio Free Asia. It exists because in no small measure because it was a significant issue in the campaign of 1992. I talked about it repeatedly, and I have done my best to expand the operations of Radio Free Asia. The very purpose of Radio Free Asia was to beam honest, open debate into Asia so that, as you know, just as we do these interviews, you know, you ask me whatever questions you wish to ask and you press me on matters that you wish to press. And I think they made a big mistake. It was especially troubling to me that they denied the visas and thereby denied themselves getting any credit for having given visas to people that they traditionally have not given visas to. They were quite broad. The Chinese Government has always taken particular offense with my support of creating Radio Free Asia because they believe that we did it for the purpose of undermining the Government of China. The truth is we did it for the purpose of advancing freedom of the press and freedom of debate and freedom of speech throughout Asia. And all governments that do not recognize these things should feel that, in effect, we are opposed to them, not because of particular policies apart from the idea that we think everybody ought to have free access to ideas. So, I think they made a mistake. But keep in mind, I would not that is not the same thing as negotiating over nonproliferation or economic issues or anything else because every nation reserves to itself the complete and unilateral right to decide its visa policies. I have a followup question. Our feed has been heavily jammed by the Chinese Government. Are you going to raise this issue when you are meeting with the Chinese leaders? Yes. Yes, I am. You know if you look at there are now 400,000 Chinese who have access to the Internet, but we estimate there will be 20 million in the next couple of years. If you look at what happened in Europe, in Communist Europe, and how it was basically flooded with tapes and CD's, as well as with Radio Free Europe, there is no way and if you look at the fact that as China's economy becomes more internationalized there will be more and more ideas coming to China. If you consider the fact that 2 1/2 million Chinese traveled abroad last year, and many of them were not part of any government if you will, censored government operation, it is a losing battle to try to keep ideas that are contrary to official dogma out of the public debate. It is, in the end, not in the interest of China. China will be you see I believe the Chinese Government missed a great opportunity, and I do not have the same attitude some people do. I do not think they did act in their long-term self interest; I think they missed a great opportunity; I think by giving you a visa and letting you come in and talk to people and emphasize the continuing human rights concerns, I think they would be showing strength because they would be showing the capacity to change. And I believe that that, in the end, is the ultimate test of any system of government. You have to have the capacity to change, to respond to legitimate human aspirations. You do not have to give up the society's dominant values or cultures. There are many things within the whole history of Confucian thought and culture in China from which all societies could learn many positive things. But we know from just studying the landscape of the last 50 years in the world that oppressive government in the end will be resisted by people and in the end is inconsistent with developing a free economy. You cannot say, We are going to have a free economy, but we are going to try to keep controls on what people know, what they hear, what they can say. And so I think from my point I had a slightly different reaction than you did, I know you are bitterly disappointed and angry, and I think you should be. But my view is that they would have shown strength and judgment by giving you the visa and letting you come in and talk to people who would criticize them. I do not think America is weakened because every day someone takes the floor of Congress and criticizes me; every day someone writes an editorial and criticizes me; every day there are I just do not believe that. I think that and of course all liberty, any freedom let me say this any freedom granted across the board is bound to be abused from time to time. It is in the nature of liberty that it is subject to abuse which is why the framers of the Constitution talked about how important it was for us to build responsibility internally into the character of our citizens. But in the end, we are stronger when we debate and differ, and we are more likely to get the truth than if we control access to information. So that will be a big yes, I will ask them to stop jamming Radio Free Asia. Thank you. ENTITY, another issue which has sort of been a losing issue is the issue of Tibet and the Chinese Government meeting with the Dalai Lama and negotiating greater autonomy with the Dalai Lama. The U.S. Government has in the past put pressure on the Chinese Government to do that. They have so far not done that. You have assured the people in this country and in Tibet that you are taking a message to the Chinese. What is new about this message? What in this message is going to make the Chinese listen and actually sit down at the table with the Dalai Lama? Well, I think it is first of all, let me say at this particular moment I do not feel free to say everything I am going to say to President Jiang because of some of the sensitive work I have been doing on this issue for the last several weeks. But again I would say my general point is, not just to President Jiang but to the other influential members of the Chinese Government: Forget about our difference over what is right and wrong; we think it is wrong to deny the Dalai Lama access to his people in Tibet; we think it is wrong for the people of Tibet to be subject to any sort of religious, cultural, or economic discrimination. We have not advocated independence for Tibet, separation, civil war, anything disruptive. We have advocated, if you will, autonomy with integrity. It is supposed to be an autonomous region anyway. It is our understanding that that is the position that the Dalai Lama has taken. So my argument to them, the larger message will be, let us lay to the side for the moment the fact that I believe what is happening is wrong, and they do not . I do not believe it is in China's interest. China has been very was adroit in trying to find a balance between taking back Hong Kong without destroying what was special about Hong Kong. Now, I know Hong Kong is an economic engine, but a country is made great by more than its economic engines. And the Tibetan Buddhism as a religious faith, as a culture and a way of life, the ability of the Tibetan people to be free of any kind of economic or other handicaps and the signal it would send to the rest of the world about China's attitude about human dignity and diversity and difference of religion, race, and opinion the gains to China from doing this would far outweigh any marginal extra tension they might feel about the long-term future of Tibet in this context. So my argument is going to be, you know, from the point of view of the pure self-interest of the Chinese Government: This is an easy issue; this is not a difficult issue; doing the right thing here is plainly in the interests of China. That is the argument I am going to make. But they do not see it that way, ENTITY. This argument has been made in the past. They obviously do not They do not see it that way because they continue to believe that the only that it is just one step to losing part of China. I think it is important for Americans to understand that this is something that I have learned not just in dealing with China but in dealing with all other countries. Countries are like people; they have a collective memory. And in order to deal with nations effectively when you have differences with them, it is important to understand what their worst nightmare is. Because if we are dominated by our nightmares, we make decisions that are not rational in the eyes of other people. For example, when dealing with Russia in trying to expand NATO, we had to remember that the Russians were invaded by Hitler and by Napoleon. And that even though no one is now alive who was alive when Napoleon invaded Russia, it is something that is deeply embedded in the psyche, in the consciousness of the Russian people. So that if territorial changes are made along the border of Russia, you have to be sensitive to that and work it out. China is the Government of China, the leaders of China, their worst nightmare is disintegration, you know, because they have these memories of when China was weakened and vulnerable to foreign attack, vulnerable to government by warlords, vulnerable to the opium trade, vulnerable to everything because of the disintegration of the central authority. Therefore, to an outsider who knows nothing of China's history, the importance to China, which is so large and so big, of the one China policy vis-a-vis Taiwan, of getting back Hong Kong, of making sure that nothing could ever happen and Tibet to promote any separatism. To us, we see only the downsides of those things. To them, a lot of the things they do which to us are unacceptable, they do, I believe, because they are too much in the grip of the historic memory of disintegration. And one of the things I have to do is to not lose my patience or my determination, to work until I help to create for them a new and different historic reality so that they feel more confident in doing what I believe is the morally right thing to do, as well as what is in their own self-interest. But I think it is important to recognize that you cannot assume that none of these people would be in positions of influence in the largest country in the world if they were without intellectual ability, without sensitivity, without the capacity to be effective. So when they do things that the rest of us think are completely irrational, we have to try to understand what it is that makes them do that. I just think they could get more goodwill in the rest of the world, for less effort, by doing the right thing on Tibet than nearly any other issue. And I think that getting them to the point where they will see it that way depends upon their having a clear understanding of what a resumed dialog with the Dalai Lama would lead to, not just in a year or 2 years but in 10 or 20 or 30 years. And I am not sure the United States has ever had the kind of systematic effort on this that I have been expending for the last few years and that I will continue to expend as long as I am in office with the fond hope of being successful. I intend to continue to work on this very, very hard. It is obvious that we have no power to compel them to do this. There is no tool, no incentive, no anything because nothing is as important to the Chinese as the territorial integrity of their country nothing because of their history. So I have to find a way to argue my case and prevail, and I will keep doing this. I care very, very much about this, and I have been working on this hard for the last couple of years, and I will continue to do it as long as I am ENTITY. How high is it on the agenda for this trip? Well, for me it is a big thing. It is a big thing because I think countries I think all countries I think the United States has done this, too. None of us are you know, we all make our mistakes, and we all have our memories, but I think when a great country, because of an inaccurate reading of the facts of a situation or being in the grip of a historical nightmare, makes an error, the consequences can be quite severe. For example, it took us 2 years and a few months to get the American public to the point, and our allies to the point, that we could go in and end the Bosnian war. Now, a lot of people looking from the outside in said, Look at this terrible situation in Bosnia. Why do not they just go and do something about it? Why are they taking 2 years? Well, the people who say that did not live through the experience that our military and our people did in Vietnam. Bosnia was not Vietnam for a lot of different reasons. An outsider could say to all of us, America, why do not you understand this is not Vietnam? But it took us a while to work through, as a people, and with our allies, why it was not , what it was, and what we had to do, what our clear moral responsibility was, what was in our national interest. We did the right thing. And in the lifetime of a country, 2 years is not very long to take to do that but it took it was a lot of hard work. And you would be amazed in the debates and the discussions, if you just go back and read things that were in the public in the beginning there were a lot of people who were afraid, Oh, this is Vietnam all over again. So I am I have developed some patience in working on this. I am impatient to get the results, but I understand what it is like to try to change the mindset of a nation, the psychology of a nation, when it has deeply embedded historical experiences that become a part of the way the leaders of a nation look at everything that happens thereafter. So, from Tibet to the Korean Peninsula, what do you expect to accomplish from this trip over the Korean issue? Are you going to appoint a special envoy to the Korean North Korea? Well, right now I think the what I would like to do is two things. First of all, I want to get a reaffirmation of the partnership we have with China in the four-party talks. I want to send a clear signal to North Korea and to South Korea that we are prepared to do our part, but I also want us to clearly support the bilateral efforts that are now going on. Since Kim Dae-jung was inaugurated in South Korea, I have been quite encouraged at the attitude he has taken toward, you know, reaching out directly to the North. It appears to me, based on the work we did to end the work that we did with China together to end North Korea's dangerous nuclear program, which had a lot of involvement from Japan and Russia and other countries all supported us. It appears to me that there are some of these matters that divide the North from the South that will have to be resolved directly between the two Koreas. And then there are other things that they will actually need the framework of the four-party talks to work through and the active involvement of China and the United States. We will be talking about that. But again, this whole matter has acquired greater urgency because of the nuclear tests on the Indian subcontinent. You know, we have to keep the commitment of North Korea in place not to have a nuclear program, particularly since they have such facility in building missiles. It is a very, very big issue. And I think this is one issue that the pace of the resolution of this depends a lot on the calculations of the people in North Korea and South Korea. We actually could move rather quickly on this, or they could drag it out the way they have been. But for the United States and China, what we have to do is to keep the lid on it, if you will, and keep it moving in the right direction. And I think we are committed to do that. I think we will be successful there. What about the special envoy? Are you considering a special envoy? Not at this time because of the level of direct involvement between the North and the South and because right now it would not be consistent at this moment, at least with the nature of the four-party relationship, where it is a partnership with the United States and China working with the Koreas. If there came a time when I thought it was the right thing to do, I would obviously discuss it with the Chinese and with the South Koreans and decide. ENTITY, I know we are running out of time here so what critics of this trip you are going to make to China in a short while have said that this is going to be more about symbolism than about substance what exactly substantially do you hope to achieve on this trip, and are you planning to make some strong speeches on the issue of human rights and freedoms when you are in China, including at the welcoming ceremony at Tiananmen? Well it is interesting, a lot of the critics who say that then turn around when you ask them what they want me to do, what they want me to do is to make it even more symbolic and give up any substance. So all my critics who say this is about more symbolism than substance when you ask them what they want me to do they want me to make it even more symbolic and give up the substance. I believe we will make some progress in a number of areas. I think we will make some progress in nonproliferation. I think we will make some progress in dealing with the Asian financial challenges; I hope we will. It is a very big issue that could directly affect the lives of Americans. I think we will make some progress in dealing with energy and environment issues which are very, very important. You know the pollution in China has now made respiratory problems the number one health problem of children there. And it is a huge issue. I think we will make some progress in our scientific cooperation, which has already yielded some significant benefits. And I hope, whether it is obvious or not at the end of the trip, that we will advance the human rights dialog. In a structural way, let me say I think it is important that we advance the rule of law cooperation that we have developed we have begun with the Chinese. And let me explain why. If you can get a country like China to change its legal system, even if the leading edge issue is commercial, it is in the system of law that protecting commercial rights and protecting rights of free speech and citizenship tend to merge. And one of the things that I would like to see over the long run is that I would like to see us move to the next step where China moves from reassessing its position on this or that or the other political dissident from timeto-time and releases them, to the point where we have a systematic change in the way people are treated. I think that should be our longterm goal. Those things will not make as many headlines, but they will change more lives. So I would expect there to be some advances in this whole rule of law cooperation we have been doing. And if we show progress in all these areas, I think the trip will be very much worthwhile. What I am trying to do is to have I do not mean to say I think symbols are important, actually, but I think it is important that in the end what matters is results. Are lives changed for the better? Is the direction of the country better over the long run? This is a difficult trip because of the differences between us, but it is also an important trip because of our common interests and because so much is at stake. It seems to me that the chances of doing good for the American people and for the stability of the world far outweigh the dealing with the difficulties presented by the trip. I have seen the Chinese work with us, for example, with great reliability I could just mention a few things on the non-proliferation treaty, the comprehensive test ban, the chemical weapons treaty, the observing most of the Missile Technology Control Regime's requirements, stopping cooperation with Pakistan and Iran on a lot of their nuclear programs, other programs. It is not they have been very good allies in many of these areas. They gave great leadership to our meeting the other day on the Permanent Five statement on the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests. And I think if you look at the areas where we have made progress, they make the argument for a continued, disciplined engagement where we try to advance our interests, but we never pretend that our interests are only security issues or our issues are only economic issues where we merge our human rights and our political concerns with these other matters. And we just pursue the whole agenda, and we do the best we can. I think it will produce more results than any available alternative. A strong speech at Tiananmen? A strong speech at Peking University? There is no speech at Oh, there is no speech at Tiananmen? At the arrival ceremony, which is well, you know where it is, right off Tiananmen Square. There is no speech, it is just you know, and by the way, the United States is the only country that I am aware of where we have little remarks at the arrival ceremony. Every country I go to, it is the same thing. I get out; you go through the ritual; and then you go in and begin your meetings. But I will say what I have to say in other forums. Thank you very much, ENTITY. We appreciate your time. I enjoyed it. And we hope you will wear this hat. I love this hat. It is quite pretty. Hey, you look good in it.

{"id": 182, "text": "Well, we appreciate your taking the time to, in effect, chat with your neighbors through us. That is a very nice thing to do. Well, please do it. I was pleased to see in the bulkhead back there that the temperature in Santa Barbara is 74 degrees, and we were joking that with the wind chill factor, it is 78 degrees. So, now that you have got the houses built for your guests and for Lee Clearwater, and I guess the irrigation ditch is either finished or almost done, what is your next big project at the ranch? Or is there one? Well, it is been quite a time since the last one. Yes, we finished the irrigation project, and right now I cannot think of anything else to fence in. There are always some little things to do around there. But there is always firewood. And the last 2 years there has been, I must say, an ongoing project which can fill in any time that we do not have a special thing like the irrigation to do. A couple of years ago in April, you will remember, there was a freak snowstorm up in that area. Yes, indeed. And that was about an 8-inch wet snowfall at our ranch. And during the night, Lee told me that it sounded like an artillery barrage with those live oak trees, the limbs breaking off. So, wherever you go in the woods, to this day, I think we could spend the rest of our lives there are these downed limbs all over. And so when there is nothing else to do, why, we pick another spot go in, clear it out, and cut the brush off, stack that for burning in the winter; and then whatever's usable, make into firewood. We are trying to clear it up, because it really it was just you cannot imagine I have got some 8 by 10 photos for an album from the ranch what it looked like, scenes of some of them. But it was just, well, it was a disaster. We tried to leave your privacy alone as much as we can. But under the circumstances, I remember that morning when I heard about snow, I called Lee up at the ranch, and I said, Lee, did you get any of that snow, because we can see it from downtown. He said, We got 8 inches of snow up here, 9 inches. And I said, Come on, you have got to be kidding me. No, he says, 8 inches outside the President's side door there. And so I ran a little piece in the paper, and Not only downed, but then there is some that, you know, that the lumberjacks call widow makers and that is the limbs that have broken off, and they are still hanging up there. We never know when one of them is going to come in. Right. What is it exactly that keeps pulling you back to the ranch? I mean, what do you get from attacking all that innocent wood? Well now, remember though, the environmentalists, I am sure, will be happy to know we do not cut down trees for firewood. We have to cut the firewood, because the only heat we have are-come from firewood and such. But, no, we do not cut down trees. We have done it by things that are down, and there is always in as much woods as we have there is always trees that come down by themselves, that nature takes care of. And those we cut up, and sometimes some judicious pruning, where we think we can improve the tree with a little pruning. Is it the sheer physical enjoyment of doing it? I mean, when you are doing this, are you really thinking about anything else, like the Mideast, or are you really thinking about that log there? No, it is a real change. And it is not always that; I think part of it also is that there is always a kick into building something. And we did a lot of work all those wood fences that we put in that were not there, a lot of work on the house itself. It was a little, old adobe that was built in 1872, and we did most of the work ourselves there, fixing it up the fences. You get a good feeling out of what you have accomplished there. But the riding, of course, we like. But I will tell you, I think that particular place casts a spell on you. Maybe it is the fact that you have to turn into a kind of private road that just serves a few ranches; unlike the previous ranch we had down south where the highway went within 250 feet of the house. At Malibu. Yes. Yes, I was there one time. Well, in this one, when you get in there, the world is gone. I was lucky enough one time in the '76 campaign you took Frank Reynolds and Walt Zaboski and a couple of other people up there, and I went along, and so we got the tour of the house and a couple of things we have seen. We know that there is mountain lions and bears up there. Have you ever actually seen them? I have not seen a bear yet. I have seen the evidence tracks and so forth from the bear. And it is usually just a bear; they are pretty territorial. And the same with the mountain lions. Now, I saw one young one. Bobcats you see frequently. But the closest adventure that we had with a mountain lion was one day, early on they had Secret Service, and there was a big one station up on the hill above the house, looking down the pasture to where they could survey everything. And the fellows would take turns up there and with a camp stool sitting and watching. And one day one of the agents came down, and his eyes were as big as saucers. And he did not know whether what he saw was just to be expected or whether it was unusual. But he had sat there, motionless, while a mountain lion strolled by about 30 feet away. Wise. And he was wise to stay motionless. But that was the closest contact any of us have had with one. Someone told me that I ought to ask you about snakes, because they heard that awhile back, maybe right after you bought it, you and Lee Clearwater bagged, I guess, some rattlesnakes and dumped them in some place called Snake Lake? We named it Snake Lake after what we'd done. No, they were not rattlesnakes. We had some these rattlesnakes. In California and that kind of country, you are going to. We had a pond there that The one next to the house? that used to be temporary. It would go dry in the summer, and we fixed it so that now it catches the drainage, and we have a year-round pond. And all of a sudden, there must have been a hatch of snake eggs of the kind that I do not know what you call them it was a kind of a gray snake with black and red vertical stripes on it, and it seemed to be a water snake. They headed for the water. But this hatch they were all about 12, 14 inches long. And if you'd come out the door, they'd scatter across the lawn; you'd see them going. And to the women on the place, that was not very attractive. So one day, Barney, Lee, and I I said, I have got an idea. Now, I have never liked to pick up a snake. I have always heard that people who handle them herpetologists will tell you that if you ever do, you will lose any of that feeling about a snake that once you have picked it up it is firm and a cool body; it is not slimy or anything of that kind. But I headed down I got some big paper bags like they use, the markets use and we put on gloves, and then we went out. We started catching them, putting them in the bags. Well, pretty soon we missed too many. We'd grab, and with those clumsy work gloves on so I peeled off the gloves, and I found out the herpetologists were right. After picking up a few, well, we'd pick them up and stuff them in; we had a bagful. And then I did not want to go around, you know, slaughtering them and-bloody, awful bloody to do that. So, we put them in a jeep, and down we'd go. Way back down the back corner, there is a pond just off the our border, the ranch of our border. So, we dumped these snakes there and kept wanting to get the big ones, because I figured they have to do this every year if we did not and eventually came upon the two adults. And we captured them the same way and dumped them down there. But one day when we were getting them pretty well, we kept count. It was over 120, 120-odd snakes that we picked up and dumped. But the last half-sackful, we were this was before the helicopter, still had agents I had a half a sackful and no time we were leaving the ranch that day to go down to Snake Lake. It was the wrong direction. So, I just put it in the car. And we' started down the hill and two agents in the front. And you cross a stream about three times on the road down. So, at the first crossing, I said, Pull up, stop. And they tried to stopped. And I got my sack and got out and dumped the snakes. And I came back, and three people were just staring at me those were in the car all the time. Was that while you were campaigning or while you were President? It had to be from the campaigning because, the other I was we have the helicopter now. You were talking about shooting a rattlesnake one time. Which story do you want? The one where you shot the rattlesnake. Oh, well, I was still Governor when we took over the ranch. And some of the people, my staff they loved to come up there with us on a weekend, come down from Sacramento. And they'd come up, and they'd pitch in. We were doing all this work. And one of them he is now an architect he and I got in the jeep and went down the back country looking for some type rocks there is rock everyplace up there, but a lot of rugged kind but one of those rounded things for something we were doing up on the lawn; then we did not locate any. And we started back, and he said, There is a snake. There was a kind of a ditch beside the road and then a bank going up, and then rocks are all up on the bank. And I stopped, and I got out and started around the front of the jeep. And I said I do not like to go around killing things, but I said, If that is a rattler, I am going to have to. And he had started to get down on his side, the side where the snake was. And all of a sudden, he was backing up right onto the jeep. And he says, Kill it! Kill it! And sure enough, it was about 4 feet long, and it was a rattler. And it was trying to get up the bank. I looked and I could not find anything to get it. And there was a rock about the size of a lime nice, oval, smooth rock there in the road. And I picked it up, and just desperately I let go. I hit it right on the head, and it was just squashed. I never said a word. I just came back around, got in the jeep. We started back down. When we got to the house, I went in where Nancy was, and I heard him outside telling: And then, he says, then he picked up this stone, and he threw the stone, and he hit that snake right on the head. And Nancy's listening to this, too. And I turned to Nancy and I said, And he will never see me throw a stone again as long as I live. Is there something on the ranch that you call the hanging tree? Yes. What is that? Well, there is a great history about that ranch. Yes, I am familiar with a lot of it. It goes back to the old Refugio Pass. Originally part of it went right through our ranch. Now it goes around the Yes. But the trail is still there, the evidence of the trail. And all of this history and you know the bandit Oh, yes. The famous romantic bandit I know the one you mean, with the Spanish name. He traveled it. And when we came there, when I first saw the place before we actually bought it down this canyon, a friend of Ray Cornelius, who had the ranch Ray showed us this big oak tree. Now, on one side of the tree was a face carved on the side of the bark. And it looked like the pictures that you see of Jesus. It is gone now. The bark, you know, got old and peeled away. Only a little sliver shows a part of it Right. But on the other side, not gone, is a cross, and then some notches. And Ray thought it was a clue to some kind of treasure. And he used to go down there trying to figure out these notches what do they mean? Well, I took one look after we and I said, I know what that is. Got to doing some reading of the history of the area there is a great big limb comes out of there and I said, That is a hanging tree. That must have been where they did their own justice in those days. So, we have just named the canyon Hanging Tree Canyon. But there those notches are, how many? About 9, 10 of them. Do you still run cattle on the ranch for the agricultural preserve status, or is that not the case anymore? No. Well, I did run when we got up there, it was what they had done before me, and they had grazers. Bring them in at the beginning of the grazing season yearlings keep them, and then sell them for the increase in weight. And, naturally, that would not meet the cost of the ranch. And then something in the Treasury Department happened where they began naming ranches hobby ranches, and they were no longer deductible. And but, also, this move-why there was just no way to keep on doing that, being away as much as we are. So, I quit. But what I do do is bring in a few yearlings now and then and butcher them for our meat and so on Well, you still qualify for the California-the Williamson Act Ag Preserve status? Well, yes, because we are not subdividing or anything else of the land Right. So, yes, this meets those terms. There is been some criticism by people saying that, Gee, on the one hand President Ronald Reagan may get some significant cutbacks and some Federal tax breaks that are enjoyed, but son of a gun, he is still taking that California tax break. Well, that is the only break we have. But that was on there 10 years before we came there from the time that the act went in. The County Board of Supervisors in California can designate certain land, that if you will sign a contract I think they are in 10-year stretches sign a contract that you will not develop that land, you will not, you know, sell it for tracts and that sort of thing, and keep it in its present condition, then it will be taxed on that basis, not on its best potential value. The truth is, I do not think very many people could afford to do this without that act. I think it was one of the great land preservation things that is ever been done in California. It was there in effect when we came, but It is been very successful, certainly in our county. There is half a million acres in Ag Preserve, and yours is just a little Yes. And I love it the way it is, and I do not want to change it. But I would not be able to afford to stay there if somebody said, Oh, how much would it be worth if it was a subdivision? Right. Real value. It sort of brings up security. You made clear that you wanted as little security as possible commensurate with your new position when you became President. You have still got the guy sitting outside at night on the vehicle, and you have got dogs around you know, the whole bit. Down at Point Mugu, when you come and go, there is some personnel, you know, you wave to who are across the street. And then there is a little disgruntlement. They say, Well, gee, we have got all the super secret clearance, you know, they do the missile work and that kind of stuff, and yet now they have got buses parked there, so it is very difficult for them to see you know, they say, Why is all that really necessary? Well, I will tell you, I have never intervened in any of the security things that are done. And when we land at a military base, not only that but some kind of other ones, sometimes the families of the personnel are turned out, and I say a few words to them; and sometimes not. And I have never asked who does that, or who determines that. But today I have been told that there is going to be a whole turnout there at the base all the families and everything-going to be Maybe they will let them back in closer to, say, where the press is. I have never even inquired or intervened in anything like that or who makes those decisions. You leave it to the pros? Yes. Or whether it is the local base. Your home is about the size of a Goleta tract home. It is what, 1,500 square feet? Other places you live, such as the White House and down at Pacific Palisades, that are a bit larger do you ever miss any of the amenities at Rancho del Cielo in that very modest house? It was very wonderful to get in that size house. It is you have said it; I think I heard you say it is about 1,500 square feet. Well, this is one of the benefits of going up to Camp David. There you go to a and you spend a weekend in a normal size house, where you can open a door and go out in the backyard and things of that kind. No, the White House there is no question about the luxury and all of that, but you can get a kind of a bird-in-a-gilded-cage feeling out of it also. So, you like rattling around, obviously, in that small house? Yes. The house itself, of the ranch, I guess, may be possibly the most isolated, geographically, retreat of any President in modern times. I gather you do not feel the isolation? No, no, not at all. You do not feel out of touch at all? I cite the passage: And I look to the hills from whence cometh my strength. I assume that you and Mrs. Reagan have given some thought to what happens in that glorious day when you return to California after the second term. What are your current plans about retirement? I remember you told Barbara Walters that you did not think the ranch would be your full-time retirement home. No, I have never thought that. I think then that would be too secluded and so forth. No, we have always loved living in Los Angeles, and we just assume that we will find ourselves a home in Los Angeles and then, just as we did before, go to the ranch and So, somewhere in the L.A. area? Yes. Did you give any thought to Palm Springs? No, no, that is nice to go to at certain times, but I have never been a-Gets a little hot out there. I have never been a great aficionado of the desert. Well, are you and Mrs. Reagan actually looking for a house at this point, or is that something that is far in the No, I think we will wait for awhile, closer to the time when Occasionally we run a letter to the editor, wondering why does President Reagan have to come out to California so often at substantial cost of the flights and all of that. And some of them say, Well, we understand that, but could not it be once or twice a year, instead of five or six? So, this is your chance to give a direct reply to those letters to the editor. Yes, and I would like to very much. Let us look back over the history of previous Presidents. I do not know of any of them that did not have some place, sometimes even more than one, that they liked to go. I remember the same criticism of Jerry Ford because of Vail, Colorado, and his wanting to ski. Certainly my immediate predecessor seemed to get back to Georgia a lot Georgia quite a bit. But before them, there was President Eisenhower in Augusta, Georgia; there was Nixon and his home in Biscayne Bay, Florida, in addition to the California Right house out there. No, I have to say that, first of all, I think Nancy put it once better than anyone else: Presidents do not get vacations; they just get a change of scenery. And you are still President. The job goes with you. Now, an awful lot of this cost is a cost that would go on anyway, if you stop to think about it. This plane now it is been many, many weeks since we have been on this plane but this plane does not just sit there. This plane has to get so many hours that it is put in flying. And this just takes the place of those. The salaries of the people and so forth, those would go on the staff who're going along whether they do that or not. Yes, there is some cost of while they are away, out there living expense and all. But as I say, the job goes with you. And I find, and I guess every President before me has found with Franklin D. Roosevelt it was Warm Springs you find that there is, there is something that you need. And I look at it in another way: At my age, how many more years do I have to go to the ranch and enjoy the ranch? You give up an awful lot in privacy and so forth in these positions, and I think you are entitled, as long as you are still President, are still faced with the problems that I have spent some days at that ranch, the better part of the day, on the telephone. Well, let me ask you a couple of questions about oil, which is of some interest to us out in Santa Barbara. Is there any spot from your property that you can actually see the oil platforms out in the ocean? Oh, yes, because those that are up, further up I am always tempted to say north, but actually it is west, as the coastline there runs Right, exactly. A true Santa Barbara resident knows the directions. But, we can see them, because from our ranch and that is one of the reasons why, when you asked a little while ago about Palm Springs no, I could not get that far from the ocean. There are spots on our ranch for riding when we can see both the Santa Barbara Channel and the Santa Ynez Valley at the same time. We just have to turn our heads. Can you see as far as Goleta? Like Storke Tower on the campus? Or is that a little too far down? No, we cannot see that, never see that, but we see all the way to Anacapa, out to the Anacapa rocks That is very good the coastal islands. We are at we are about 2,400 feet at the ranch. But we see those derricks. When you see those, obviously, you must think about this business of the drilling in the channel. Some people in Santa Barbara, including some businessmen, say, Well, let us explore find out where the oil is, but not drill, not actually put it out. Let us hold it in reserve, because of the danger to the economy if there were another spill. Obviously, do you think that is possible, or realistic? I think they are ignoring one thing we found out at the time of the spill, because I was Governor at that time. And we sent incidentally, that was a Federal lease that leaked. And we found out at that time and they, themselves, told us that had they known the regulations on State leases, had followed the same regulations, there never would have been a spill. So, the Federal Government at that time the Nixon administration they adopted for Federal leasing we still do the same standards and requirements the State imposes. Now the Federal Government has about 16 platforms off the coast of California, as increasing by some and they seem, we seem now, the Federal Government, to be getting all the attention and abuse. But there are several hundred wells that are State leases that have been there for quite some time. But when we sent the experts in and they were not buddies of ours we sent scientists from the university campuses of California in to study this whole area and the problem. And they came back with one unanimous recommendation drill, get the oil out. They said the bottom of the channel is badly fractured. There are 16 permanent oil slicks that have been there as long as the memory of man. Yes. And they said the safest thing you can do is get that oil pumped out of there because there could be a natural disaster I am sure they were speaking of an earthquake at that fractured bottom that would create a disaster of such dimensions that you could never get a the previous off strike, or leak, as far as I can learn, was only about 790 barrels of oil. Now we are taking out tens of thousands of barrels. But their recommendation was drill, get it out, and remove that permanent threat that lies off the coast. But also, it is , of course, the policy of the administration to go after the off-shore oil, even though which reminds me that we have got a glut now in the world of oil that does not show any signs of slacking off. It may happen. And so a lot of people say and, again, we get letters to the editor But we do not Why drill with this glut? Well, we have offered oil lands for lease, and they have turned it down. There have been no takers. But here is another thing. The same people cannot scream about the trade deficit, the imbalance of trade, when 50 percent of that is the oil that we have to import. Now, would not it make more sense for us we have already reduced considerably the amount of oil that we have to import, making ourselves closer to self-sufficient. But from a security standpoint, from even the balance in trade, it would make much more sense for us to be producing the oil ourselves than having to go out and buy it. There is an ongoing debate, I guess, perpetual in Santa Barbara some people say, Oh, those platforms are ugly as sin. Other people say, Well, they are not. Jeez, at night, they are beautiful. What do you think about them? Which side of the debate do you come down on? I have to say, you know, I think this is really reaching to say that some structure out there that far out in the ocean when you have got that whole expanse of ocean it is not as if you were looking at the ocean through a little frame, and now somebody put something in the way. And I once said to people that were complaining, I said, You know, we have got a lot of freighters, those liberty freighters, up in mothball. Why do not we bring down some and anchor them between the shore and the oil derrick? And then the people would see a ship, and they would not find anything wrong with that at all. Or they do not mind seeing piers that go out a half or a quarter mile into the ocean. And why, I do not find them and then, as you say, at night I know one lovely old lady there who automatically complained in the daytime because she could see this derrick from her place. And then it was one of them that I guess they no, it was when they were drilling, and then, when they evidently did not find oil, then they left. Then, she said, I miss the lights at night. Of course, the great solution would be to drill the rigs underneath the water, so we would not have to see the platforms. Yes. But, of course, the expenses of that are I know that there have been times when outrageous. There have been times when some people in the business have talked about the possibility of submerged parts. Of course, there, you look at it in another way, too, what if you have nothing's perfect what if you have an accident there and then how do you deal How do you exactly. Hundreds of feet down in the ocean. Tell me about the first time you saw the ranch. Well, you come in that private road. And now, you come down about a half a mile or so, and then you turn in the entrance road that was built before we got the ranch. But when we first looked at it, the entrance was way up here, right near that after you go through that gate. Right. Then you come in on a road. And you come in through the trees and everything. Well, Bill Wilson and his wife, knowing that see, we had to sell the ranch in order to be Governor because there was not a Williamson Act and the property taxes on that ranch there is no way I could be Governor and keep that. But we always knew we would want one. So, as we were coming to the end of the second term, we started looking for a ranch. And Bill knew us very well, and they had a dude ranch down at the bottom of the pass. And they knew the kind of thing that I was looking for. So, one day we were up visiting them. And Nancy and Betty got in the back seat, and he and I got in the front seat, and up the mountain we went, up Refugio Pass. Of course, pretty soon, you know, all you are going through is that chaparral and Yes. goat land. Right. And I was kind of thinking, gee, you know, maybe somebody's got a house up here on the mountain with a view and calls it a ranch. But it does not look like there is any space up here for a ranch. And Betty had never been up the road before. And Betty was saying, Bill, turn around. There cannot be anything up here. He just silently kept driving. And all of a sudden, as we came up close to the gate, suddenly here is a kind of a meadow of smoke trees beside the road-and I think, well, then, maybe he does know what he is doing. And then we came to the gate where we turned in at the private road. And we came in through that second gate, now, and we are winding on this little gravel road through all of these trees. But it is, you know, kind of looking like rolling land and heavily wooded and suddenly you come out of those trees, and there is this saucer. Right. Down there you could see the house and the barn and so forth, and then you could see this thing. It is a 600 and some acres of meadows and oak and the-forests and rolling hills. And there are some very steep canyons and so forth also. But I just took one look, and I said, Let us buy it. And Bill said, Hey, do not talk that way. We have got to talk with the couple that is selling here. He says, Quiet down. But then we got down there, and Ray Cornelius and I they had horses, and we got on the horses. And we took a ride and That did it. And I tell you, it is just unbelievable. It really is. Well, it is a fabulous place, and, you know, you are very fortunate to have it. And I think you got a pretty good deal on it, too, myself. I do, too. I went back, and I looked at the deed at the courthouse to see what was on it. The ranch at Malibu. Bob Taylor is alive. Bob, Ursula, and their son, Terry. And they came up to the ranch, and Bob and I I have always liked to plink and I am not a great hunter. I have never killed a deer or anything. But I do not mind killing rodents. And ground squirrels in California are an official, you know, pest. In other words, you can call the State, and they will come in to eliminate them. Absolutely. And with the horses I mean, we were infested at that other ranch. So, Bob and I because he was a hunter-well, we decided we'd go down and Terry, his son, came with us to a place where I knew there was a colony and where we could lie in wait. And all of a sudden the boy, Terry, was wandering around, came running back in, Snake! Snake! So, we went over, and sure enough it was a rattler. And it was heading toward the rocks also. Well, I looked around, and there was a stick. And I grabbed the stick, and I swung at it, and the stick broke. And it was almost to the rocks and getting away. Well, now, I always at the ranch wore boots and britches, English-type boots, and I knew you can be pretty brave about snakes with those boots on. There is no way they are going to get through those boots, and they are not going to strike that high to get above. So, the stick broke, and he was almost getting away. I stomped on his head with my heel and then looked down. I had sneakers on. Oh, my God. Just entertaining them-had not ridden that day or anything, waiting for them to come up. I'd forgotten all about it that that day. I just put on sneakers and a pair of jeans. And I am looking down at my heel snake's head just if I'd missed him But you nailed him, huh? that was the end of Between your sneakers and the rock, you know, the Pentagon might be interested in a new weapons system, it seems to me.

{"id": 513, "text": "Well, let me say at the outset of this interview that this visit is in no way intended to complicate the situation there rather to show American interest in Poland, to support the general desire that we feel for Poland to have improved relations with the United States and with the West in general. It is, obviously, as I will in every country give me a chance to give our views freely and openly about freedom and things of that nature, but it is not a visit that is trying to complicate matters between the Soviet Union and Poland, or anything else. It is in keeping with my view that Europe should be whole and free, and in saluting the changes that have taken place, and hopefully in contributing to Poland's quest for more democracy and economic reform. So, we are going in a constructive vein, not in some critical vein or not in some mode of trying to complicate things for somebody else. ENTITY, this group here the composition of this group is actually a testimony to the progress of pluralism, because we have Solidarity here on the Government's side. Yes, and is not it, ENTITY, very interesting that you were in Poland about 1 year and 9 months ago, and now you are going to Poland again? Is there any particular reason that you make the second trip in such a short time? Well, in the first visit, we had an opportunity to meet with Mr. Walesa , and certainly I was accorded wonderful hospitality by General Jaruzelski . At that time, as you point out, Ziggy, there was no real communication between Solidarnosc and the leadership. And again, I, in that visit, did not try to involve myself in the internal affairs of Poland. But by being there, and by being permitted to speak on the television and say what was in my heart, and able to meet with Jaruzelski I mean, with Walesa, even though Solidarnosc was then outlawed, it opened up for us a strong feeling for Poland, and you could sense the indications of change. And now there has been change; there has been an evolution in these relationships. And so, it is appropriate that we go back and talk respectfully to the leaders about their aspirations for economic reform, my aspirations for an era of what we call in our East-West relations beyond containment, and in terms of the evolution of the moving of countries toward the West as much as they feel comfortable with. So, it is a visit that makes sense because things are evolving, things are moving in the direction that we salute. And also, going there as Vice ENTITY, I am sure, is quite different than being There is only one ENTITY, and true, there is only one Vice But that is not seen the same as the ENTITY going there to say how much an evolving relationship means to the United States. So, let me ask maybe more precisely, ENTITY, what would you tell the Polish Nation about the American attitude toward our efforts to achieve self-determination, about all those free elections which took place recently in Poland, about our achievements in gaining free speech and the restoration of our free will in Poland? Yes, I'd simply say the visit is a symbol of our support for Poland as it moves toward greater democracy. And I had a chance to make that point a couple of years ago and will make it again. So, it is symbolic. I will state that we are encouraged by changes. I will try not to look like I am fine-tuning the internal affairs of Poland. I am not going to do that, but I think I have every right to say I am encouraged by the changes we have seen. Obviously, we followed the roundtable discussions and agreement, and salute that agreement. As you know, we are committed to representation by the people, of the people. And so, we see changes in the way elected representatives are chosen and go forward to represent their people we salute that. So, it will be in this vein, this thematic vein, that I will be talking. And in Poland, you know, there is an historic opportunity now to help end the postwar division of Europe. I mean, Europe has been divided. And if we handle ourselves correctly with the Soviet Union and if the changes continue that we are seeing, we could see a Europe that is freer and more whole. That is what you said in 1983 in Vienna in your Yes, and I talked about differentiation there. And, indeed, that Vienna trip led to my feeling very comfortable going with a similar message to Poland. So, it is evolutionary here. ENTITY, already during the first few minutes of this interview, you used, several times, the word change, because everybody now sees the changes taking place in Poland. For some, the changes are too slow; for some, are too quick. Yes. But as a very experienced politician, you certainly know that good policy requires not only change but also some elements of stability that prevent the change from erupting, from being blown up and leading to some kind of a deep crisis. Would you like to comment about what elements of continuity in central and Eastern Europe would you like to see? Well, I'd like to see respect for the will of the people. And I think as we I do not want to well, let me start over. I will stand by that, obviously, but I would like to see very candidly I'd like to see Soviet troops we are talking about Poland now out. I do not think anyone, anymore, thinks that there is a danger of invasion from the West into Poland, for example. And I would like to see a continuation of the change that would result in the Soviets feeling comfortable in taking their troops out of there. Having said that, I will not be trying to inflame change so that it does what you are talking about. The people seem to be handling it very nicely now, with elections and with discussions around a table. And I do not want to do something that would inadvertently do what you are talking about, or that you asked about; and that is, to have some crisis that will compel other answers. And I do not want that, and I am not going to deliberately do anything that is going to cause a crisis. I am going to feel free to speak out about as I did right now at the Iwo Jima Monument about what we hold dear and what Polish-Americans think and what we want to see about a freer, a more whole Europe. And so, I think we can do this, Daniel, without exacerbating tensions that I know exist in Poland. We are realistic; we know there are tensions still. But this shall mean that are you in favor of withdrawing foreign troops from all Europe, from all countries? I would like to see the start be withdrawing of the troops from Poland, because I think there is no danger at all of an invasion of Poland from the West. And I do not think anybody in Poland thinks there is a danger of invasion of Poland from the West. But what I will do, in answer to your question, is to press forward with a very bold plan that we have laid on the table at NATO which substantially reduces U.S. and Soviet troops deployed outside their borders, and that sends a good signal. And then we go for whatever the next step might be; but as long as we have this tremendous disparity in Soviet-deployed troops or bloc troops versus NATO troops, it is pretty hard to visualize eliminating all troops. But I think we are on the right track, and we are on the right step here. And so, we will go down that road. ENTITY, let me go back to your coming back to Poland, if I may. In September you had a chance to talk to General Jaruzelski, who is both the man who introduced martial law, but also the roundtable talks and the first honest elections since the Second World War. What are you expecting of your conversation, of your forthcoming conversation now, with the General? Well, obviously, we have got a baseline. We have a point of departure, because with respect, he gave me probably a disproportionate amount of time. I was the Vice ENTITY; he was the head of the whole country. And thus, I remember with sincerity what I thought was great courtesy to me. And through that courtesy, we had more than a passing conversation; we had a conversation about a lot of things that now have changed. We even had a chance to talk about Solidarnosc with Jaruzelski, his knowing my view and his making very clear to me his view at the time. Now there is been an evolution of views. And what I think we ought to do is pick up from where we started and then say: All right, we have come along here. We want to help you in an economic sense. Some of that will not be easy, because the concept of reform economic reform to get full cooperation from these international institutions, monetary institutions, is essential. And I expect he will be saying, I have tried to make reforms, and do not push me too far on all this. And I will understand that, but I will say: Please understand my position. We want to help you with OPIC; we want to help you with privatization; we want to help you in the international institutions and with special trade benefits. But we need to know that you are going to be able to not only continue existing reforms but expand on reforms so that the economic system that works will be given a chance to work unfettered. And that is a big key, and that is not easy for a lot of regimes all around the world. It is not just Poland and Hungary and Eastern Europe; it is many countries. And so, I know that what I will be talking about will not be easy for the regime to accommodate or, indeed, even for those who have been in opposition. And I am talking now about newly elected people, too. But I think I owe the people with whom I meet our honest assessment, and I owe them my frank view of what we can do, and what it is going to take for us to be able to do it in terms of economic support. Just pressing this a bit, ENTITY, will you intend to set any specific conditions for the U.S. aid to Poland, and would you like to have control over implementing such conditions, if any? Not control we cannot try to control the internal affairs of another country but we have got to be clear that to get the kind of financial support from the outside world and the kind of private investment that I think can be enormously helpful, that certain reforms must go forward. But I am not going there in an arrogant mode, trying to say we have got all the answers. I mean, he might turn around and ask me about our debt and then I'd be embarrassed. I have, ENTITY In fact, he might; and if he did, that would be fine. I will tell him what we are trying to do about it. And one of the things we are trying to do about it is to live within our means, and that gives us less money available to do many of the things I'd like to be doing around the world, you know. So, then we are kind of on a catch-22 on that one. I sometimes get the impression that both sides, Poland and the Western alliance countries, are expecting too much from each other. The West is expecting from us to change the system, to change the economic system, to introduce pluralistic democracy and, at the same time, to preserve the necessary level of stability and prevent the country from collapse. On the other hand, our country expects from the West such a significant assistance that would make all these changes possible to happen in a country which is so heavily indebted and its economy is in such a mess. Well, I think you raise a very interesting point and very carefully phrased, I noticed. But that is why I keep saying I do not want to exacerbate tensions. I do not want to make competing forces move apart inadvertently. I do not want to say something that would complicate the move that is taking place towards democratization and economic reform. I feel confident enough that both of those things are necessary for Poland for Poles to enjoy the freedoms that I think most Poles aspire to. But I am not going to say hey, you have got to have a Senate with 100 people and a Congress with 435 and a ENTITY and a Vice ENTITY and 50 States. I mean, that is our system. But I am going to say we have got common thoughts here. I think of the Polish people as treasuring freedom. I think of them fighting having a tough go there in World War II and standing up to the hordes that finally just were too much. I think of the patriotism of Poland. I think of the affection that Americans of Polish heritage have for Poland. And I'd like to try to have the interlocutors, the people I talk to whether they are labor or whether they are in the regime understand that we want to help and that we do admire the changes that have taken place, and not put it into a great East-West mode all the time. We have problems. I am keeping my eyes open, but we are going to try to improve relations with the Soviet Union. But I cannot look at these outrageous differences in conventional forces, for example, and then say to everybody in the United States, hey, we do not need to be concerned about Soviet intentions. They are modernizing their intercontinental stuff, their nuclear weapons. They have got disproportionate advantage in conventional forces. And so, I am not going to be naive in suggesting that we have no differences between us, as it relates to the Soviet Union. And when Gorbachev talks about a European house, we say, yes, but let all the doors be open; let it be done so people can move from room to room in that house and that should not antagonize anybody. ENTITY, you have been known as a conciliator, as a consensus-builder, as an adversary of extreme solutions. Can we write that ENTITY, the ENTITY of the United States, is unequivocally in favor of an evolutionary change in Poland without outbursts, without breaking down of the dialog among the different social forces? Can we write that? Yes, you can write it. I do not want you to write it in such a way that I seem to discourage those who may have differences. In other words, I do not want to discourage those that have felt out and are trying to get in, those who did not participate over the past many years in elections and are now able to participate. I do not want to endorse the status quo I mean, that is not my role. Nor do I want to do what you are talking about, that your question asked about, which is exacerbate tensions. What I want to do is say, Here is what we stand for. Here is what the United States stands for; and here are our aspirations for a relationship with the Soviet Union, which obviously is the superpower there. And here are my aspirations for Poland that come from my heart, because I can feel it strongly how those who came to our country from this country feel about their homeland. And I'd leave it there, Ziggy, rather than try to endorse the status quo. But I have to exhort and encourage as much economic reform as possible, as much political freedom as possible. And if I do not do that, I will not be leveling with the Polish people, and I will not be being a good ENTITY for my own for the United States. So, I do not think it is as delicate as perhaps before, but I and it is important. You see, I have no hangups when Gorbachev goes to Germany or France fine, let him go. The better hand he gets and the better he is received there they are saying, Atta boy! Keep it up! Keep what up? Keep reforming up; keep changing up. Who would have thought you'd hear lively debates in their own political process 2 years ago? So, it does not bother me as ENTITY of the United States that he gets a good standing on the applause meters over there in Western Europe. Nor should it bother him when I take this message of freedom and democracy to Eastern Europe. In my view, that does not come under the heading of his business, just as it does not come under the heading of mine if he goes to France or Germany. And so, it is in that vein I go to not competitively. Saying you want one house? Fine. Let us get all the rooms open so we can all move around in there. And let us find out what works in the economy, what works in terms of free unions, what works in terms of free politics. And we think we can speak to that because we have had some success. We are not saying we have no problems in the United States, but in these things moving around, freedom to say what you think, freedom to form a union, freedom to have a voice in the politics by the people we think we know what we are talking about there. We want to share it with you. So, it is in that spirit that we will be going. ENTITY, I think that Daniel has one personal question for you. Just one. ENTITY, last question of a little personal character. If you were a young Pole, would you now queue in front of an American consulate to emigrate to the United States, or would you rather stay in Poland and fight the difficult fight there? Well, I do not know what a young Pole would be thinking, but what I think what I'd like to think he'd be thinking is, look, I am living in a time of dynamic change. This is the time of most hope for my country in a long, long time. And I want to be a part of it, and I want to participate. I want to run for election; I want to join a free association; I want to be a part of a government to bring economic relief to my people. And I want to see Poland appreciated around the world its art, its culture, its heroism. And I want I, young guy Stanislaw, whatever my name is, at 21 years old I want to be a part of this. And that is the way I'd like to do it that is the way I would hope that some young kid could look at it. Now, maybe that is a little much, because in economically difficult times, people kind of think, hey, the grass looks a little greener over there; the ocean does not look quite so wide. If I could just make it to Chicago, maybe I could do something. But even if he makes it to Chicago, he is got to have, beating in his heart, the love of his homeland. And so, I would hope that most would say, look, I want to be a part of the change that I feel in the air, you see. Thank you. Thank you all.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpolishjournalists", "title": "Interview With Polish Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-polish-journalists", "publication_date": "30-06-1989", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3, "text": "ENTITY, John Yoo, a lawyer in the Bush Administration who gave President Bush some powers through a legal memo that the White House interpreted back then to combat terrorism and the role of Commander-In-Chief without necessary congressional approval, said: Obama has adopted the same view of war powers as the Bush Administration. Do you share that view? No, I do believe that when we passed the authorization in 2001 following Afghanistan, it was to narrow the war powers then. When our country is - when someone strikes our country as was on 9/11, it enables, it triggers any and all powers of the Commander-In-Chief. What we did with that resolution was to narrow it to the purposes. I have it right here, but if you read it, you will see that it is a narrower interpretation. What the Bush Administration, how they interpreted it and for how long is another issue. But he is not relevant to right now. What we are talking about right now is: ISIS is a threat. We have to work together to destroy them, and that is the subject at hand. I did not approve of anything said or did when he was in office, much less care about his opinion right now. But you do not think that President Obama is following his opinion right now? I mean I think the President is following the law. Yes, ma'am. Given the threat the President outlined that ISIS posed and you mentioning it, does not Congress have a bigger role beyond just voting on the narrow authorization for Title X? Is not it shirking its responsibility by just focussing on that issue alone? Well, Title X is really an important part of this and among the initiatives that the President talked about last night, the idea of our training Syrian moderates to fight ISIS in Syria is an important part of it and it is very timely. That is why we are talking about that now. I would hope that it would be in the CR because that is the train leaving the station, and that is - the President needs this to happen now. There is talk of people doing it separately, but that takes longer than just putting it on, again, the CR that is leaving the station. But that is by no means to say that that is the limitation on our involvement in this. In factthere is a presidential request for two billion dollars for meeting needs in Eastern Europe related to Ukraine, Iraq, and other concerns in the Middle East. But in terms of this authorization, this is a big debate. We are having a brief right now. As I leave here, I will go to another briefing on the subject. And again, yes, I do believe Congress has a role. What I did say, though, was what the President is doing now, I think he has the legal authority to do. I know he does. I have studied this issue for a very long time. Yes, sir? You have been in the Intelligence here for a very, very long time. How far do your concerns go as we take new steps to confront ISIS about the aftermath - the potential aftermath of the Saudis arming their Sunni assets in Iraq? The Iranians arming the Shiite militias anew? Us arming the factions in Syria, all that come at ISIS sort of in a triangle here? And eventually, there will be a lot more armed people in Iraq, not only weapons but battle hardened people with - have their incentives changed at all? What is your vision of the aftermath after we do this? Well, I started my comments in praise of the President about the establishment of a different government in Iraq, which I think, if that had not happened - so then the situation that you are describing, I believe, would be exacerbated - although your concerns go beyond Iraq, I understand. It goes into Syria. So, to have a government that understands its responsibilities - that it is not just about who the Shia in charge, the Shia rule and we do not pay any attention to the needs of Sunnis or the Kurds - that provides fertile territory for some, especially the Sunni, to be responsive to ISIS when they were originally coming through. When you are arming people, you are always concerned. And also, ISIS, I am concerned, is a mutating thing, you know, what is it that it becomes and what emerges out of all of this. So that is why it has to be comprehensive. The Europeans are very interested because they have thousands. We may have up to 100 foreign fighters from the U.S. who have gone there. The Europeans have thousands, more than 10,000 maybe, who have passports from their countries, who are citizens of their countries who have joined the fighting force. So the concern goes beyond our concern about our homeland; that is our primary responsibility. But this is a very big deal and we have to deal with it in a way that is not just - and Aaron talked about it - the use of violence. Yet people think one more act of violence is going to end it, but it is just an endless flywheel. No, we have to be smart about it as to how we go forward so that we are having not just military initiatives but political initiatives and diplomatic initiatives, too, so that we reduce the fertile territory for more recruitment of terrorists. Then what level of confidence has been transmitted to you, ENTITY, from the Administration that Iraqi coalition 2.0 or whatever we are on now is actually going to work this time? Well, we have to support it. And one other part that I did not mention was continuing the humanitarian assistance in some of those regions. As you see what the U.S. did to help those people on the mountain was lifesaving, but it was also helpful in having people understand that we are there to help the people. We are not there to help the government. But to have a government that is there for all of the people is essential for us to be putting in resources because your question is exactly the right one. This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. It is challenging and it is complicated. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. Yes, sir? On the Continuing Resolution, two questions. One: how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to the Ex-Im Bank separate from the December 11th end date for the CR? And then the Senate: there is some talk of trying to set that end date for the CR actually in the next year. How do you feel about those and how do those affect the Democratic support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for this year is very appropriate. That is what the CR does: to get us past the October 1st beginning of a new fiscal year. So the end date in December is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for the next year. I do not think we should delay it any longer. What are the choices? I mean, we know what the decisions are that need to be made. If they do not think that they can be made within the next 10 days, then they should be made within the next couple of months. In terms of the expiration date for the Ex-Im Bank, I am totally opposed to that. I think that the Ex-Im Bank is a formidable instrument for competitiveness for the U.S. businesses, large and small. I think that it affects every region of the country in terms of job creation and stability. I think that it has already having an impact on contracts because of there is uncertainty about the longevity of the bank and even its existence and that if you put the date to next June, you are effectively putting a marker as to the demise of the Ex-Im Bank. So, let us just go forward. I like the Heck bill that has a long term authorization for the Ex-Im Bank, and I would hope that those forces outside the Congress - communities that are affected, businesses that are affected and the rest - that this is about job creation; this is about keeping America number one; it is about facilitating our exports. To play with this is really damaging, because you are dealing with a bank and you are talking about a few months and a few months and a few months, you are not talking about the stability and the certainty that businesses need. And some of these are very big contracts. So again, as far as the forces outside the Congress, I do not know why they are not more active with their Republican friends to say: this is not something to mess with, because I do not believe that it is good. Yes, sir? ENTITY, there never really has been much hope for peace dividend following the, you know, 9/11 mindset and foreign policy, et cetera, as we wound down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Do some of your Caucus members, though, worry that as this fight against ISIS gets expanded, we will siphon off a lot of dollars for social programs? Yes. That they may favor? Yes. Well, there is some necessities that honor our responsibilities to meet the needs of the American people. I do not think we are getting - I do not think with the evidence that I see before me, I judge, that what we are talking about is by no means of the scale of where we had been before. This is focused, targeted, discreet, and it is not engaging in hundreds of thousands of troops being deployed. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of that. But certainly, every time we talk about an initiative or the use of force or initiation of hostilities, it is a question of resources, and we have so many unmet needs in our own country. It is really, what is more of concern to Members when we were building roads and schools and hospitals and all the rest in Iraq and Afghanistan, when we had unmet needs in our own country, but actually that part of the diplomacy is important to security as well. But in answer to your question: yes, there is a concern, and it has been brought up at our meetings, but we have a first responsibility to protect and defend. That is the oath we uphold. I think I only have time for one more question. Yes, ma'am? ENTITY, has there been a concern raised in the Democratic Caucus in voting for this authorization and ending up in a situation potentially in the future where you have sort of a political pushback much like you did with the authorization for Iraq? Well, we did not vote for the authorization for Iraq, so we did not get to take - well, and House Democrats overwhelmingly voted against the Iraq initiative in 2002. October initiation was in 2003, of hostilities. But right now we are watching, observing, and judging. The President made - we have briefed. The President made his speech last night which was very strong and convincing. Our Members are proud and support the President. We are being briefed right now, once again. And so the question is: what is the challenge? What are our resources? How do we engage other countries? What is the country that we are dealing with in terms of having a new government? And what is, you know, what is our definition of success? But it is not about, you know, whether we take a vote or not. We are not at that point because we believe the President has the authority. And so it is deliberative; it is open to new information - that is what our Caucus is about - and I am very proud of the thoughtful way that they have approached it. I will go back to where I began on this subject, and that is, that a matter of a couple of months ago we did vote and we got an amendment on the floor. And I think I have it right here and what it says: The President shall not deploy or maintain United States armed forces in a sustained combat role in Iraq without specific statutory authorization for such use, and that is after the date of the enactment of this concurrent resolution. So, hopefully we do not have to go beyond what the President is doing now and we will not need that vote, but we stand ready to have that discussion. Thank you all very much. I have to go back to work.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiweeklypressconferencetoday6", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Weekly Press Conference Today", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-weekly-press-conference-today-6", "publication_date": "11-09-2014", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 465, "text": "And now to our exclusive conversation with We sat down on the White House or at the White House on Monday to talk about the passage of his landmark health-care legislation and the nasty political tone in Washington these days. But I began by asking ENTITY about Sunday's surprise visit to Afghanistan and why he felt it was important to go now and not earlier, when he was making his decision about a troop surge. Well, keep in mind that as I was making the decision about troop strength, Afghanistan was still in the midst of an election or the post-election jockeying that was taking place, and it was very important to make sure that president of the United States does not look like he is parachuting in and changing the outcomes there. And I thought it was important now not only to send a strong message to the troops that we are fully behind what they are doing -- I think we have seen some progress, and I wanted to mark that progress that is been made -- but also it is an important time for President Karzai. He has made some important steps in the right direction, in improving governance, reducing corruption. But there is a long way to go. And as our troops are on the front line, as they are going into places like Helmand, potentially into Kandahar, how the Afghan government performs is going to be just as important as how the Afghan national security forces perform. I am curious to hear you say there has been progress, because I was in Afghanistan with Secretary Gates back in December, and he told me, when he met with President Karzai, he talked about cracking down on corruption and cracking down on the drug trade, the very same topics you talked to President Karzai about. And I am curious. Do you think he is listening? Is he getting it? I think he is listening, but I think that the progress is too slow. And what we have been trying to emphasize is the fierce urgency of now, that on all of these issues, whether it is making sure that farmers are actually getting help on their irrigation, whether it is emphasizing the need to make sure that police and prosecutors and judges are operating fairly, in terms of making sure that in these provinces that the governors are actually looking out for the best interests of their people and what kind of appointments are being made -- on all those issues, we have got to make progress faster, and we cannot dilly-dally around. And so, look, obviously this is a country that has been stressed and in war, in one way or another, for decades now. It is not going to transform itself overnight. But my hope is that President Karzai can recognize the incredible opportunity he has to be the father of a modern Afghanistan. Let us talk about health-care reform; health-care law now we can talk about. It is seen as a huge victory for you, your presidency, for Democrats. It is a tough pill to swallow for Republicans. It is been described in a lot of different ways. Your vice president described it in colorful terms. How do you describe it? I think it is a critical first step in making a health-care system that works for all Americans. It is not going to be the only thing. We are still going to have adjustments that have to be made to further reduce costs. Now what we have is a system in place that preserves the employer-based system but says, number one, insurance companies, they have to behave themselves. We are going to have a private system in insurance, but you cannot bar people from getting insurance because of pre-existing conditions. You cannot drop people when they get sick and need coverage most. So you cannot game the system. The second thing is we have set up what is going to be called an exchange, but it is basically just a marketplace where individuals who right now have to go out on their own and buy insurance and have no leverage are suddenly going to be part of a pool of millions of people, including, by the way, members of Congress. And that gives them more buying power, the same way Wal-Mart has more purchasing power when it buys from its suppliers. That will force insurance rates down for the vast majority of people. So what we now have is the basic principle that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should have to go without basic health care. My hope is that this year we are going to see some very concrete benefits that people get. Small businesses are going to get billions of dollars in tax breaks to provide insurance to their employees. Parents are going to be able to put their children on their health insurance up to the age of 26. Insurers are not going to be able to just drop people from coverage because they feel like it. This version of health-care reform did not receive one Republican vote. You almost have to say that again Yeah. -- to let it really sink in: Not one Republican vote. And a lot of people wonder how a bill, or now a law, could be good for the American public in general when it did not receive one single Republican vote and when a recent poll said 50 percent of people are not in favor of this plan. How do you respond to that? Well, look, I think that the Republican Party made a calculated decision, a political decision, that they would not support whatever we did. There was a quote by a well-known Republican senator who said, This is going to be Obama's Waterloo. This is going to we are going to bring him down just the same way that we brought down Bill Clinton, by making sure that health care fails. And I think that is unfortunate, because when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas. I mean, a lot of commentators have said, you know, this is sort of similar to the bill that Mitt Romney, the Republican governor and now presidential candidate, passed in Massachusetts. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation. And so So you think it is all politics. Well It is not about the inner workings of the bill. It is all politics. I will say that any objective observer looking at this bill would say that this is a middle-of-the-road, centrist approach to providing coverage to people and making sure that we are also reducing costs. I am frustrated that Republicans, who I think had an opportunity to help shape this bill, declined that opportunity. That is not to say that on specific provisions there might be legitimate concerns that they had, philosophical concerns that they had. Some of them, I think, sincerely believe that we should do more on this aspect of the bill or that aspect of the bill. But the overall architecture of it was actually something that was right down the middle. Daniel Henninger, who is the deputy editorial-page editor of The Wall Street Journal, had an interesting take on it, ENTITY. He said, If you produce a bill that even Olympia Snowe of Maine cannot vote for, you have not produced legislation for the generations. You have produced once-in-a-lifetime legislation that no Republican from any constituency across America can vote for. What is your response to that? And my response is -- well, number one, the Wall Street Journal editorial page generally is not favorable to Right. -- much of what I do. But I think what is interesting is that if you actually break down the specifics of the bill, you will see that this historically has had a lot of Republican support. There historically was a lot of Republican support for the notion of an individual mandate, that everybody should take responsibility. There was historic Republican support for the idea that we should make sure that entitlement reform exists within Medicare. There was historically a lot of Republican support for the idea of the exchange, which is the centerpiece of the bill. So if you actually look at the particulars, these are all things that in the past others, including the Wall Street Journal editorial page, have endorsed. And yet, oddly What you keep coming back to is that the fix was in is what you are basically saying. I think what happened is that they made a calculation, which, if you are thinking in terms of short-term politics, you can see the argument. Their attitude is, Look, if we stop this bill, if we paint it as stop this president here. -- and we stop this president here, then that will give us a lot of political benefit in November. What I have tried to say throughout is I will continually reach out to Republicans. I will continue to incorporate their ideas even when they do not vote for the ideas that I have presented. But what I am not going to be dissuaded from is us going ahead and taking on these big challenges that are critical in terms of America's long-term economic health. When we announced that we would be sitting down here with you at the White House today, our in box filled quickly with e- mails from viewers all around the country. And Jeff in Minnesota asked a question I'd like your response to. He said, ENTITY, the CBO just issued a statement this past week that Social Security had reached the tipping point a full six years earlier than they originally had estimated. With that said, how can we believe their figures on your health-care plan that says we will save $138 billion over 10 years? The reason that the tipping point was reached a little bit earlier is because the recession was so devastating. And presumably if growth picks up, then you will see that adjustment made again. Now, Social Security generally has to be reformed to ensure long- term sustainability. But in any given year or any given period, it might end up being way off from estimates because of something like the financial crisis. Here is the interesting thing, though. The Congressional Budget Office historically has actually underestimated the savings whenever Medicare has been reformed, whenever we have made changes. And that was true the last time it was done. So we actually feel pretty optimistic that not only is $138 billion going to be saved in the first 10 years, but more significantly, a trillion dollars is going to be saved in the second 10 years. Let us talk about where we are politically right now. And I do not have to tell you that this passage of this bill and turning it into law has left this country as politically divided as I think it has been in a long time. You might be able to cite some other examples. But the vitriol, the rhetoric, the sniping, the threats -- how are you possibly going to continue with any kind of legislative agenda when your opponents have said to you, I am not going to cooperate with this president, with these Democrats, unless it is a matter of national security ? How do you move on? Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the rhetoric has been overheated and overblown. And this is what happens in Washington when you have a big debate. Suddenly the passage of this bill is Armageddon. And as I pointed out, the next day, after I signed it, I looked around and no asteroids had hit the planet -- -- and no cracks had appeared in the earth. This is a bill that is going to help a lot of people and help to lower costs of health care, but it is not a radical departure from what we have done in the past. Let us talk about faith a little bit, all right? There is been a lot of tension, and had been in the previous year, about your family's choice of a church here in Washington. As of yet, I have not heard that you have settled on an exact church. Where do you stand on that? And how important a decision is it for your family? Well, you know, what we have decided for now is not to join a single church. And the reason is because Michelle and I have realized we are very disruptive to services. Now, there are a whole bunch of churches who would say it is okay, but when every other member of the congregation has to be magged any time that you attend -- so what we have done is we occasionally go across the street to St. John's, which is a church that a lot of presidents traditionally have gone to. We love -- the chapel up in Camp David is probably our favorite place to worship, because it is just families up at Camp David. Right. There is a wonderful chaplain up there who does just a great job. And so usually when we go to Camp David, we go to church on Sundays there. And in the meantime, what we have done -- there was a prayer circle of pastors from across the country who, during the campaign, would say a prayer for me or send a devotional. And we have kept that habit up. And it is a wonderful group, because it is a mix of some very conservative pastors, some very liberal pastors, but all who pray for me and Michelle and the girls. And I get a daily devotional on my BlackBerry, which is a wonderful thing. It is spirituality meets high tech. Yeah, . That is pretty good. Your girls have been here in the White House for more than a year now, along with Michelle. And when I spoke to Mrs. Obama not long ago, I said, You know, the normalcy thing, how is that going? Here comes summer. Yeah. A lot of kids -- Okay, I am going to summer camp. Yeah. I am going to go to sleep-away camp, Dad. Have you gotten that question? I have. And how do you handle it? I have. And I handle it like every other dad, which is saying, Do not you want to spend it with me? Yeah. No, I want to go to sleep-away camp, Dad. So the -- you know, the happiest thing about the past year and a half has been the girls' adjustment. They have just been terrific. They are doing well in school. They are not as constrained. They can wander around. Their Secret Service protection is a lot more low key. And so, you know, they have got soccer. They have got basketball. They go sleep over at their friends' houses. Right. They have got -- you know, sometimes I have got 12 little girls screaming on the third floor of the White House. And they have made a great adjustment. And during the summer they are going to do what their friends are doing. If I was not in the Oval Office -- So it is possible to have a normal summer as a first daughter. It is. It is. Now, I get a little worried about them when they are teenagers, because I think that is the time when you are already embarrassed about your parents. And then imagine if your dad's -- He is president of the United States. -- in the newspaper every day and people are calling him an idiot. You know, so I feel a little worried about that. On the other hand, Malia and Sasha have just turned out to be unbelievably well-adjusted kids. And the thing that is most important to me is that they are so respectful of everybody and have not gotten on any airs. And I attribute that directly to Michelle, because she would not put up with any of that stuff. All right, four names, okay? Butler, Duke, West Virginia, Michigan State. How is your bracket look, first of all? It is completely blown up. It is a sign that I was paying singular focus on health care. That is your excuse, and you are sticking with it? Well, you know, I had done great in the first several rounds. I was in first place. I think ESPN calculated I was in the top 98th percentile. Yeah. And then every single -- Then the bottom fell out. Every single number one seed except Duke -- and Duke's the one number one seed I did not pick -- To get to the Final Four. -- at least to get to the final eight. But if you think about what we have left, you have got three schools that represent states you carried in the election. Absolutely. You have got one school that represents a state you did not carry. Right. So who are you picking? Well, I am not going to pick now. Oh, you have to pick now. No, you just -- When I was here for the Super Bowl, you picked then. You just explained to me why it was such bad politics. But I will say this. Just to show that I am not biased, I actually think that West Virginia's got a great chance. And I did not win that state, but they have got a really good team. So West Virginia over Duke -- I think the winner of West Virginia-Duke will end up winning the championship. You do not see a number five seed -- I do not . -- winning the championship. Good luck with that. Thank you. We sat here a year ago, Super Bowl Sunday. Right. And at that time, we were talking about hope and change. Right. And you were going to change the dialogue and the tone in this country. And you said, Matt, it takes time. It does. We have to build trust with the Republicans before the tone can change. Things now are worse. If you look at historically what happens is that a party that is out of power, oftentimes in those first few years out of power end up reacting very negatively. Their base ends up being very agitated. And it may take the next election or the next presidential election before things settle down. I think what is important is that we recognize, A, we can disagree without being disagreeable; B, that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, have a responsibility as leaders to set the tone -- to not exaggerate what the other side is trying to do, to not suggest that they are bad people, to assume that they want what is best for America, even if we disagree on the particular approach. And so my hope is that the Republican leadership will take that tone. Certainly that is the tone that I want to take. And I think that when you look at the issues that are still out there -- we still have to have an energy policy in this country that reduces our dependence on foreign oil; we have still got a broken immigration system; we still have financial regulatory reform, a major issue that I have been talking about now for several years, where we have got to figure out how to prevent the same kind of situation where a few reckless banks can bring down an entire economy. And on each of these issues, I am going to actively seek Republican support. But there are going to be areas where we disagree, and I will continue to maintain a tone where, if they have got good ideas, I am going to take them. Right. But if we disagree, then we will fight it out -- We are talking a lot about -- -- on the floor of the Senate or the House. We are talking a lot about Republican disagreement. In your opinion, do Democrats deserve any of the blame for the tone in Washington right now? Well, there is no doubt that Democrats are known to play the same game, which is to exaggerate the venality -- -- of the other side. There are times where Republicans do things I do not like, but, you know, my working assumption is that they are doing what they think is best for the country. And I think there have been times where Democrats do not confer that same benefit of the doubt onto the Republicans, and I think that is a tone that all of us should take. When I look at the division right now, I was thinking of President Bush in preparing for this interview. And I remember, he came to office saying, I want to be the uniter. And by the end of his second term, people were calling him the opposite. They were saying, You are a divider. And I am sure President Bush would argue that the country was divided because he had to tackle some very difficult issues and make tough choices. Having been through what you have just been through with health- care reform, do you now have a different opinion of the job that George Bush did in this office? You know, I think that, having sat in the Oval Office as president, I am much more sympathetic to all presidents generally, because what is true is that there are big, tough decisions that you make, and you know that unless you try to avoid those problems, whatever you decide is going to make some people happy and some people unhappy. And I think there are some things that George Bush has done that were smart and the right thing to do. I have said that before. I do think that we now have a pattern of polarization, not just with George Bush, but also previous to George Bush with Bill Clinton, where the political culture gets so wound up. Frankly, Matt, it gets spun up partly because of the way the media covers politics these days, in the 24/7 news cycle and the cable chatter and the talk radio and the Internet and the blogs, all of which tend to try to feed the most extreme sides of any issue instead of trying to narrow differences and solve problems. Is it solvable? Well, I do think it is solvable, because I think that when I go around the country and I talk to folks, they do not think in ideological terms. They do not think in terms of Republican- Democrat. They think in terms of Is this good for my family? Will this help my kid go to college? Is this going to help me keep a good job that pays the rent or pays my mortgage? And if we can demonstrate, as an administration, that, regardless of whatever the day-to-day news cycle is saying, that we are staying focused on the big picture and helping families, and the results are good, then I think that will show that it is possible to be principled and stick to your convictions and not worry about the polls, and ultimately be rewarded politically. And, you know, nothing succeeds like success in this town. If other politicians watch and it turns out that taking a common-sense approach to problems works, suddenly, lo and behold, you might see more of that. Let me ask you about the tea party. This is a movement, this is an organization, that did not exist before you were president. And now they are in the headlines almost every day. Some say they are a legitimate movement. Others think they are a fringe group. Where do you fall? You know, I think that it is a still loose amalgam of forces. There is a part of the tea-party movement that actually did exist before I was elected. We saw some of it leading up to my election. There are some folks who just were not sure whether I was born in the United States -- -- whether I was a socialist, right? So there is that segment of it, which I think is just dug in ideologically. And that strain has existed in American politics for a long time. Then I think that there is a broader circle around that core group of people who are legitimately concerned about the deficit, who are legitimately concerned that the federal government may be taking on too much. And last year a bunch of the emergency measures we had to take in terms of dealing with the bank crisis, bailing out the auto industry, fed that sense that things are out of control. And I think those are folks who have legitimate concerns. And so I would not paint in broad brush and say that, you know, everybody who is involved or have gone to a tea-party rally or a meeting are somehow on the fringe. Some of them, I think, have some mainstream legitimate concerns. And, you know, my hope is that as we move forward and we are tackling things like the deficit and imposing a freeze on domestic spending and taking steps that show we are sincere about dealing with our long-term problems, that some of that group will dissipate. There is still going to be a group at their core that question my legitimacy or question the Democratic Party generally or question people who they consider to be against them in some way. And that group we are probably not going to convince.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday0", "title": "Interview With Matt Lauer on NBC's Today", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-matt-lauer-nbcs-today-0", "publication_date": "29-03-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 446, "text": "Good afternoon to you there, sir. Hello, ENTITY, how are you? I must tell you, ENTITY, when people heard that you were coming on this morning, their already broad beams grew broader. People are very, very delighted that you have taken the interest, sir, and the direct concern that you have with the suffering out here. But it is an inspiring morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning. It must be inspiring. The courage, the determination demonstrated by the school's administration, faculty, and students to get the campus back in operation so quickly, just a month later, is very impressive. I want to compliment President Blenda Wilson and everyone else who worked on it. I think she is there along with Cal State University Chancellor Barry Munitz. And I just have heard so much about it. FEMA spent a lot of time out there. I think Dick Krimm's with you there Yes, he is. He will be on shortly. and we have had so many reports from Henry Cisneros and Federico Pena and all the people I have had out there and all the people from California who work at the White House who have been out there. I could not believe that you sustained $300 million worth of damage. And all of your 53 buildings were damaged, and you are back open a month later. It is a real tribute to you. So I am glad to hear the California spirit alive and well. I can hear it in the background from all the clapping and everything. It is here. The Vice President is coming out to Northridge on Wednesday to inspect the damage. And I hope you will all go see him. He is younger and has less gray hair than I do, so more college students should like seeing him. Did he write that comment, ENTITY? No, no, but he might have. I mean, he is got a pretty good sense of humor about it. We kid each other a lot. And his sense of humor is great, especially if the jokes are at my expense. ENTITY, why does it take an earthquake, a disaster of this magnitude to get such a generous response from Washington? I mean, should not some of the Federal aid and assistance be available to people who are dislocated by, for example, the closure of so many cold-war-related industries here in California? Absolutely. Absolutely, it does. It should happen. Since I have been in office, we have worked very hard to dramatically increase the amount of assistance in terms of job training and in terms of alternative development of jobs for use of defense technologies, for commercial purposes, and in helping communities put themselves back together. I came in here with a real philosophy that we ought to be spending a lot of money every year on defense conversion and on other things that dislocated people who wanted to work. So last year we spent $500 million on defense conversion. This year we are going to spend much more. And we need to do more. Now, keep in mind, one of the things that constrains us now is the enormous Government deficit, which the Congress is normally willing to suspend in the case of an emergency. So that is one of the reasons these things happen more quickly. But we are moving toward investing more in communities and in workers and in new technologies. And it should not take a natural disaster to get us to plan for and take care of the fundamental needs of our people. ENTITY, Mother Nature really has socked it to us and given most of the Nation a devastating few months. As you read and study the reports and you watch the news, do you have an overall comment that you'd care to make about the way that citizens impacted by hurricanes, blizzards, floods, fires, and now earthquakes have responded to these disasters? Well, I'd say the American people get an A-plus for the way they have dealt with this. You know, there was a 500-year flood in the Middle West. I visited there several timesjust stunned by it. Then in the last several months you have had the fires in California, plus the mudslides and the terrible problem of the earthquake, and of course, another earthquake and the problems in Los Angeles just a couple of years before that. So this is really an enormously difficult time for people, especially in California but in many other parts of the country. And then in the East Coast, you know, we had the bitterest winter in over 100 years and many, many people died there. But it seems that when these things happen, when nature reminds us that we are not in full control of our destiny, somehow people almost relax more, and they come together; they think about what is really important; they trust each other. I think it is fascinating in how many communities the crime rate dropped dramatically after this earthquake occurred, when presumably it might have been easier to go out and steal from people. People did not want to do it as much. I think that sometimes we need to remember what it was like in the midst of one of these natural disasters and see if we cannot behave more like that all the time and realize we need each other and we are a community, and when we pull together and work together, we can do unbelievable things in a very short time. When we fight with one another, when we are divided, when we are shortsighted, then none of us can become what we ought to be. ENTITY, I know you have toured the area. It is so easy to assess the damage and compare the scene with a war zone, but I think that is where the comparison ends. But this is a campus of 25,000 students who are hell-bent and determined to get on with life, to get on with their education, and they do not look like refugees from a battlefield. Sir, should Good. Good. ENTITY, should there be such a thing as automatic sort of mandated natural disaster insurance so that no one is left out when the hurricanes and the earthquakes, et cetera strike? Well, we are looking at that. Let me say, we are trying to do more to try to reduce the cost of people and property of natural disasters by doing a better job of thinking ahead, by choosing where we will build with an awareness of potential disasters, by constructing what we do build very well, by retrofitting where it is cost-effective. You know, a lot of the retrofitting that was done on the highway structures in California really worked. And if we had had another 6, 7 months before this last earthquake, we would have retrofitted more and had even less damage. So these are things that we have to really invest a lot more time and effort in. With regard to having a Federal disaster insurance fund, I think that you have to remember that insurance works when the risk is spread broadly. And that requires a lot of people to participate, including many who do not think they are particularly at risk and others who may not be particularly at risk. So when the taxpayers do it like this, we spread the risk very broadly across all of us who live in America because some of us are in trouble. If there were a way to use insurance mechanisms to do a better job so we would not have to increase the deficit, that would be better still. But we have to ask ourselves whether that would be putting even more burden on people who are really not at risk. We are thinking about it, and we are soliciting ideas. And there are a lot of bright people in universities all over California and in businesses who may have some good ideas about this. And I assure you thatthree or four have already been presented to us, and we are going to research them all very carefully and eagerly look for other options, because we have been very fortunate that we could get the money through the Congress to deal with the floods and to deal with the earthquakes. But it is a difficult thing. When we have health care reform, will the new system, whatever its final shape, better serve the masses in time of a major disaster? Oh, absolutely. I kept wondering, when I was out in California and I realized how many people were hurt or needed medical care or thrown out of their homes and maybe subject to overexposure, how many of those people did not have health insurance, whether they did not go to the doctor or did not visit the hospital just because they did not have any coverage, or whether they did, took medical care, and now wonder whether they can afford to pay for it or whether they are at risk of bankruptcy. If we would simply join the ranks of all the other advanced countries in the world and provide comprehensive health care that can never be taken away through a system of guaranteed private insurance, it would stabilize life for working families enormously. I also will say that according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office study issued about a week ago, small businesses would benefit perhaps more than big businesses because their premiums would go down and everybody would be covered. We have simply got to stop making excuses and saying, Well, America's the only country in the world that cannot figure out how to cover its folks. You have got almost one in four people living in California without any health insurancecitizens, never mind the immigrant population, citizens who do not have health care. We have got to do a better job. ENTITY, Blenda Wilson, who is President of CSUN, would love to ask you a question if she may. And by the way, I have just realized why it was difficult for you to get through to Boris Yeltsin, sir. He was worried that you might have been calling for disaster relief. I thought I might have to get on the phone and phone around the world to get enough money to deal with it, but we made it. ENTITY, we are delighted that you would join us on this opening of our spring term. While we have been talking about disaster relief and health care, I recall your work several years ago with the education commission of the States and found you to be a strong advocate of education, partly because, I think, you realize as we do that the young people and middle-age people, for that matter, who attend California State University will be those citizens and employees and employers and entrepreneurs that are essential to economic development. When you think about the relationship of disaster relief and higher education and work-study programs, which are very important to you, what would you say to the students that are gathered here at this public university? Well, first of all, I am proud of the fact that Congress was able to come up with the money to fully reimburse Cal State, Northridge, for the losses it incurred, along with a 10 percent match coming from the State. I am very proud of that. Secondly, I hope that during this clean-up effort, there will be even more jobs available in the short run, which will help a lot and which some of your students will be able to get. But thirdly, and perhaps most important of all, the average age of a college student today is a little over 26 years of age. More and more people recognize that if they want to get a good job with a growing income, if they do not want to have the kind of stagnant wages that most American workers have been saddled with for 20 years, they have got to have at least 2 years of post-high-school education and training. And we are busily engaged here in Washington in passing some education legislation and some training legislation which will make it easier for every person in America to get those 2 years of post-high-school education and training. That is the most important thing of all. If you stay there, if you see it through, if you go on and get a 4-year education, the more you have, the better your prospects are. But we know, based on the 1990 census, we actually now have hard evidence that the global economy is punishing high school dropouts, punishing high school graduates, and rewarding people who have 2 years or more of post-high-school education. So if we want to restructure the California economy and we want new jobs in high-tech areas without the guarantee of defense, we have got to make sure that every young person and every not-so-young person in California who will go to a place like Cal State, Northridge, does so. ENTITY, I cannot think of an occasion when a Chief Executive of the United States has aligned himself so immediately and completely with a Californian concern or issue, in this case a natural disaster. Our leader locally is Mayor Richard Riordan, of course. Is he there? Yes. I had to do it, otherwise he would have camped out on my doorstep here and never gone home. Well, I feel like you have been camping out on our doorstep. I'd like to thank you on behalf of not only the students, faculty, and staff of Northridge but all the citizens of L.A. for your A-plus effort and your A-plus team. We have had, I think, more Cabinet members in Los Angeles in the last month than you have had in Washington. Thank you, Mayor. ENTITY, thank you so very much, indeed, for taking our call on the spur of the moment like that, sir. Thank you, Michael. Let me just say one thing. I want to compliment the Mayor and everybody that we have worked with in California. I know you could say that they are so good at this because you are becoming experts at dealing with disasters. But let me say, I was a Governor for 12 years. I went through floods and hurricanes, I saw whole little towns blown away. I have lived through a lot of these things. And I cannot say enough about the leadership of the Mayor and the people out there. The work that they have done, it is just been terrific. And in terms of doing this radio program, you know, one of the things I said I'd do if I ever were fortunate enough to be elected President is to try to give this job back to the people of this country and their real concerns. And you know, I just left a very important meeting with the President of Kazakhstan. That is a long way away, but it affects American interests. But our interests can only be affected there if people in California can succeed, if the people who are listening to this radio program can succeed. So, I think I did my job today by talking to you, and I just loved it. I thank you for giving me a chance to do it. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

{"id": 300, "text": "ENTITY, thanks so much for sitting down with me today. Thank you. Here we are on the week that the Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 23,000, $5 and 1/3 trillion of market value created since your election. And largely, because of this anticipation and hope that your policies will get implemented. Tell us where we stand on the tax plan right now. We are doing very well. We will we had a fantastic vote, as you know, and was budget is indirectly passed. Now it is going to go through a little bit of an iteration but it is going to end up, I think, again doing very well. And I think we are going to get our taxes. I think it is going to be well, hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that. So there is a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country. And I think that there is tremendous appetite. There is tremendous spirit for it, not only by the people we are dealing with in Congress, but for the people out there that want to see something $5,000, almost. It can be $5,000 average per individual, per group. And so, I am really looking forward to it. Let us see what happens. It it could be quite historic. That is a big deal, that on Sunday, exactly. Do you think you have the votes? I think we have the votes. I think that Rand Paul actually is going to vote for the tax cuts. I think that other people you know, we had tremendous enthusiasm this time. Health care, I was told was tougher but it was close. I mean, so far, I would say it is not even a contest. And I will tell you speaking of health care, I believe we are going to get that also. It will be in the form of block grants to the different states. And it'll be a wonderful health care. It will be a tremendous health care, managed properly in smaller doses where you can really do it much more individually. So I think we are going to get that also. And a little bit later, probably in three or four months from now, but I do believe we will have that long before the election in '18. As far as taxes are concerned, you see what is happening. It is really doing well, great enthusiasm. Yes. You soured on the health care bipartisan plan a bit right from Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray? Well I have I have looked at it very, very strongly. And pretty much, we can do almost what they are getting. I I think he is a tremendous person. I do not know Senator Murray. I hear very, very good things. I know that Lamar Alexander's a fine man and he is really in there to do good for the people. We can do pretty much what we have to do without, you know, the Secretary has tremendous leeway in the under the Obama plans. One of the things that they did, because they were so messed up, they had no choice but to give the Secretary leeway because they knew he'd have to be he or she would have to be changing all the time. And we can pretty much do whatever we have to do just the way it is. So this was going to be temporary, prior to repeal and replace. We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I think we actually have the votes. People are criticizing me for saying that. I think we actually have the votes for that. You know, we were basically one short and I think we are going to have the votes for that also, ENTITY. Yes, I am interested about that because even your supporters say, you know, he is got fantastic policies. We want to see this through. But the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the way. So obviously the feuding with Senator Corker I think there is a personal thing going on between you and Senator McCain. Do you worry that this bickering and feuding gets in the way of your agenda? No, and sometimes it helps, to be honest with you. So we will see what happens in the end. But I think, actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they are supposed to be doing. And you know, that is the way it is. I just want what is right. And I think, for the most part, they want what is right too. So we will see what happens but I do believe we have the votes for health care at the appropriate time. And I think we are going to have the votes for taxes and I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think, makes the taxes easier. The republicans want to get it done and it is a tremendous tax cut. I mean, especially for the middle class and especially for business. We have we are loosing our companies. We have companies leaving and I have to say since I have been elected, that is really stopped, it is really slowed down. There is a tremendous enthusiasm for business in this country. So, a lot of things have changed. And, you see the job creation, as well this year. It is been fantastic. If they cannot get this tax bill done this year, should they forego Thanksgiving and Christmas? Should they be here if they do not have a bill on your desk by Thanksgiving? Well I think they should and I think they will. I think a lot of things are happening unless, you know, it is going to be right after that. But I do not even like them leaving. But I will say this, I want to get it by the end of the year but I'd be very disappointed if it took that long. It could be substantially less than that depending on what happens when we send the bill back to the House. You know, they will send it back and people are going to go and make 200 suggestions as opposed to maybe no suggestions because it is a great bill. It is going to be a great bill. And we are adjusting. We are adjusting so that there is no way that the middle class does not greatly benefit. Every once in a while there is a method under which, you know, it could be that some people in the middle class will not benefit as much as we want them to benefit and we are making certain adjustments but I think we are going to have it sooner rather than later. Paul Ryan did an interview this week and said you are insisting that they have a fourth bracket. It is on your insistence that they have a fourth bracket. I know that you are very focused on the middle class but do you want to raise taxes on the rich with the fourth bracket? Well, he really said that on the basis that I wanted it or was thinking about it because I want to make sure the middle class gets taken care of. So, in that way, yes, but actually we do have four brackets because we have a zero bracket and people are not including that. So, that would actually make it a fifth bracket as opposed to an eight bracket on the other side, on the other way. I call that our competition which is the competition from the past. No, I think that when Paul says that we may not have that. I would rather do that than do anything to hurt the middle class. But, see, that is what I do not understand and I followed your policies really closely. The state and local income tax deduction eliminations you take that away and then you go to a fifth bracket or a fourth bracket however you want to say it and you get a higher rate for their top earners. Right. If the top earners pay 80 percent of the taxes why are you so afraid to cut taxes on the top earners? I think this, look, you know, I am very happy with the way I have done part of this in my civilian life, all right. Of course. This is not about - Other people well it is about me representing rich people. OK. Representing being representative of rich people. Very interesting to me Bob Kraft was down. He was very nice. He owns the Patriots. He gave me a Super Bowl ring a month ago. And he - We will Putin took his Which was very nice. That is right. But he left this beautiful ring and I immediately give it to the White House and they put it some place and that is the way it is. That is great. He said to me he is a good man. He said to me you have to do us all a favor, give the tax decrease to the middle class, we do not need it. We do not need it. We do not want it. Give it to the middle class. And, I have had many people, very wealthy people tell me the very same thing. I have had very few say I want more, I want more. They really want to see you know the middle class has really not done very well over the last long period of time. And, so when Paul mentions maybe one more category which I'd rather not have, it may not happen. But the only reason I would have and he does say this, he is very plain on what he said is that if for any reason that the other middle class is not being properly taken care of. So, that is a big factor but we have so many things that are going to be so great bringing the corporate tax down maybe is the most important. And, we have a lot of most important but bringing it down from 35 down to 20 percent that is a massive that' the biggest that we have ever done. It is a big deal in the corporate rate for sure. That is a big deal for companies; that is a big deal for investment. I think one of the other ones is expensing, you know when you write something off in one year as opposed to you know over many years, I think that is going to be tremendous. We have so many things in this plan that are going to be for growth and you know your next questions going to be deficit so and on, and I fully understand that we all understand it, and growth, if we pick up one point on GDP that is $2.5 trillion if you think of. Two point five it more than pays for everything and I think we pick up much more than 1 point, and I have been the one that is saying we are going to hit 3 sooner later than later, in the last quarter we 3.2. Yeah. We have not been there real we have not been there in a long time, it is been a long time. As you know the previous administration did not hit it for the year for 8 years. In 8 years it did not hit it at all. Here we hit it you know an early quarter for me, and actually before that it was down in the ones, it was down in the ones. People got used to like 1.5% growth for a long time. Well, you know I call up I become friendly with leaders of other very, very large countries and say how're you doing, and they would say We are not doing well, we are not doing well. GDP is at 7%, GDP is at 8%, we are not happy. And I am saying you know we had it a 1% so I really think we can do much more than a let us see what happens, but 1 point is 2.5 trillion and millions of jobs. Let me ask about your courting of the Democrats recently I mean the reason that I brought up this other bracket is because I feel like the Republicans get bullied by the left, by this whole talking point of it is always tax cuts for the rich. Yeah. You been - By the way that is an automatic talking point. Exactly. I mean for sure I get along with Schumer - Are you getting bullied again, are you getting bullied again? I do not think so it does not seem like it we got the budget passed. I you get a fifth bracket, are you getting bullied? So here is the thing Schumer, I like Schumer, but before he even knows the plan he will say Oh this is for the rich so he does not even know what the plan is, and he is screaming it for the rich. He did it with healthcare too, he said This is for the rich, this is for the rich you are not going to get your coverage. Everybody is going to go into hospitals; that is going to be terrible, the world is coming to an end, OK. Do you know what the plan was. That is OK you know we are all learning politics right, and he said that well, he says the same thing because I saw him two days ago before he really knew what was happening, he said Oh no it is for the rich. So it is an automatic statement, it is like in business you ask for twice as much I mean. Right, well you go back with Chuck Schumer. I do. You both from New York You know I have always gotten along with him. Is this helpful in terms of negotiations? I do not think it matters, I mean I really do not , but I met with the Senate Finance Committee, I met with the Republicans, Democrats together right across the hallway two days ago we had a great meeting. Ron Wyden was is their Chairman we had a fantastic meeting, there is a lot of similarity they want tax cuts also ENTITY. They want tax cuts and they want them as fast as possible. Now they do not want to say it and their saying Oh gee, you know the the the middle class I call them the working people because they really are the working people, but the middle class does not benefit that is that is their standard but they know it they do benefit. They are the big beneficiaries, the other thing the other big beneficiary are jobs, wages - Right. Jobs. And that is been your priority. So it is been my priority and if you look at what I have done between regulations, I have cut more regulations in nine months then any president has cut during the entire term that they were nobody's cut that You are better than President Bush, I mean the Federal pages are down 30% under your leadership. Well, and and by the way I have just begun because So there are more regulations rollback - Well, there is a lot more I mean really lot more, I mean I think I can double it before it is over, but a lot of it is statutory where you have to give a 90 day notice and then you have give 120 day, we have given those notices I mean we are going to be doing a lot more. But you look at at you know Keystone Pipeline, Dakota Access Pipeline these were all dead projects that I approved them in my first few days I mean literally in my first few days 48 thousand - see I think that is why we have had a 3.1 percent GDP. Because of the regulation roll back that you did there are some industries that are not that regulated. I am wondering what you think about tech right now? Because you have these companies that are more powerful than ever before, they have got everything all the data on us. They are selling the data. To the tech companies these more regulated? Well I guess some people talk about freedom and other people talk about we want to know who is taking adds or doing whatever and I would imagine something's going to come down along the lines of like we are doing right now. For regular you know whether it is commercial or not for a normal broadcast company. It will be very interesting to see. You know that is a argument that is happening right now. It will be very interesting to see what there are two very distinct views on that. I can go honestly I can go either way on it. ENTITY who do you want to see running the Fed? Well as you know I I have been seeing a number of people and most people are saying it is down to two, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Powell. I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot. I really like her a lot. So I have three people that I am looking at. And there are a couple of others. I said I will make my decision very shortly, pretty shortly. Is not there a way that you can get Taylor and Powell in there? Because you have got a vice chairman opening as well, you can actually put them both in there. Is that in your thinking? It is in my thinking. And I have a couple of other things in my thinking. But I like talent. And they are both very talented people. And it is a hard decision. It is actually a very important decision. People have no most people have no idea how important that position is. That position is actually more a lot of people get rid of the Fed. Take the Fed out. That is a very important position. It is also important psychotically. If the right person is there a lot of good things can happen. I think I am doing a good job for businesses in that way. People are coming into the country; you saw what happened with Foxconn going to Wisconsin. You see what is happening with Apple where there I said to Tim I said to Tim Cook, I said Tim I want some of those beautiful plants that I see in China. They have to open in the country. You got to give me some big beautiful plants, it is happening. It is all happening. The auto companies are coming back into our country. Coming up to Michigan again, they are going back. We are not going to be taken advantage of. We were taken advantage of I would not say the companies so much, but by other countries. We were so badly taken advantage of. As you know we are negotiating with NAFTA. And they have an election right now, and lots of things. But at some point either NAFTA will be renegotiated so that it is fair to the United States or it will be terminated. It was very simple. People think that is a very tough statement. But it will probably be renegotiated but if it is not successfully renegotiated so it is fair for the United States, it will be terminated. Look you had a very good victory this week in terms of the Senate vote on the budget, I know that. But you have had all this money going out, new money that people were not expected, right? You have money now going to California with the wildfires, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida. Many have got defense you want to build up the military. You have said many times the present President Obama underfunded defense. Where does this money come from? And how are you going to get control longer term of the debt and deficit in this country? When is that conversation going to pick up? Well it is going to be all growth. Look it is going to be growth. I think that growth can be staggering. I also think we have a lot of waste in this country. And we will be doing other things. We will be doing welfare reform. I mean that is coming up. Okay, and whether people like it or not. You know people do not like having a house and working three jobs and having somebody nearby where their living better than the person with the three jobs. It is not fair. And that is all coming up, believe me that is going to be out there very soon. I want to get the taxes first. I want to get health care. We are doing a big infrastructure bill which will be a very positive thing. But we are going to have tremendous growth. Are you going to tie the infrastructure to the tax plan? I could tie it. I was thinking about tying it but there is too many honestly. You lose a few votes, you gain a few votes. I do not want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is. So the tax will come up, the infrastructure will come up, the health care will come up, I have an economic develop plan, that I would like to propose that I think will be, you know very, very good for our country. I think the growth in the country is going to be tremendous. I think we have tremendous potential, it is hard to believe because it has been, you know going for a long time. But the waste, the trade deals we have, that are so bad. You know, the money you are taking about is, peanuts compared to the trade deals. We lose with Mexico, almost 70 in terms of trade deficits, almost $70 billion dollars a year. We lose with China $100s of billions a year, we lose almost every country. If you look at I mean there is hardly a country. I can name two, and it is tiny surpluses, tiny. We lose with almost every country, we have massive deficits. And that is gonna change, we cannot allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not gonna happen, anymore. Are you gonna remove the budget caps, in terms of defense spending? Well I wanna do it, because one the one thing have do, is have to spend on defense. This is a very rough time out there. I was left a mess, whether the people like or not, I think we can say it in different ways. I was left a mess, whether it was North Korea or the Middle East, where we have made more progress against ISIS. Literally ENTITY, we have made more progress against ISIS in the last 9 months, than in the last 8 years, as you know. I mean as everybody You have had tough talk on everybody. I mean it is not a question of tough talk, we have also produced, I mean the Middle East is a whole different ball game right now as far as ISIS is now, is concerned. But, but we have towe are in a world, there is a lot hatred in this world. There is a lot of hatred towards us in the world. We need a strong military, stronger than ever before, and we are going to have that. So I do want to get rid of the caps at least at some point in the near future. Do you ever feel like sometimes, some of your unscripted Tweets, unscripted comments get in the way of the larger message? I have spoken with a lot of supporters of yours and while they love the policies; they say we, you know we feel like we are always defending something he said, that he really did not mean, to say that way. Do you think that is getting in the way of your agenda and the overall message? You need bully pulpit to tell the American people why tax reform is important It is such an interesting question, because I have friends that say, oh, do not use social media. See I do not call it Tweets, Tweeting is like a typewriter when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show. I mean the other day, I put something out, two seconds later I am watching your show, it is up You are right. We are watching your Twitter feed OK, and then, you know they are well crafted. I was always good student, I am like a person that does well with that kind of thing. And I doubt I would be here if were not for social media, to be honest with you. Because there is a fake media out there, I get treated very unfairly by the media. And I have a tremendous platform. I think I have a 125 million people between Twitter and Instagram and all of them and Facebook. I have a tremendous platform. So you So when somebody, says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never be get the word out. I had a big rally, we were in Texas for something and I then I went back unfortunately for the hurricanes. But one women was standing, I had thousands and thousands of people, but woman was saying 'keep tweeting, it matters.' It is sorta of an interesting I really believe, again I do not call it, I call it social media. It is not just the Tweets, Tweeting is good. I mean having that direct relationship. It is just tweeting on other subjects other than the message that you really want to focus on. You have to keep people interested also. You know, you have to keep people interested. But, social media, without social media, I am not sure that would be here talking. I would probably not be here talking. You definitely have an incredible connection to voters and to supporters They want me to the American people. Period. You know what I find; the ones do not want me to are the enemies. The people who really do not like, what happened with me and winning the election and all of the things. Those are the ones who say he should, I remember, I was in I was in a faraway land and I was tweeting. And I said very little. I said like, I am in Italy right now, you know, for the summits. So I am in Italy right now and the weather is wonderful. And one of the one of the dishonest networks said ENTITY is on a Twitter stomp again ENTITY. They say ENTITY is on a Twitter stomp within one tweet. It is such dishonesty. But without social media, I am not sure that I'd be here today, so I do not I understand. I do not think I want to take any chances. And we do get points out there I mean, we get tremendous points. I can express my views when somebody expresses maybe a false view that they said I gave. It is totally unconventional. But it works It works It just seems to work. I mean, it is a little unconventional. I have to ask you about that emotional press conference yesterday with General Kelly, your chief of staff. The way he came out and talked about his son and defended you getting criticism from the Gold Star family well, the media, really. Were you expecting that? He is a a very elegant man. He is a tough, strong four-star Marine. You are a four-star Marine, you have got something special to start off with, OK? General Mattis, General Dunford also, but very few. He he was so offended, because he was in the room when I made the call and so were other people. And the call was a very nice call. He was so offended that a woman would be that somebody would be listening to that call. He was he actually could not believe it. Actually, he said to me Sir, this is not acceptable. This is really not and he knew I was so nice. Look, I have called many people. And I would think that every one of them appreciated it. I was very surprised to see this to be honest with you. He spoke very well yesterday. And by the way, I spoke of the name of the young man and I it was a really it is a very tough call. Those are the toughest calls. It is a very tough These are tougher than dealing with the heads of countries, believe me. These are very, very hard calls. They are sad. And sometimes, you know, the grieving is so incredible. But he is just an elegant man and a wonderful man and he is doing a fantastic job as chief. The Congresswoman, Frederica Wilson, she said Oh, everything he said was because he is just trying to keep his job. He does not need this job. In fact, he did not really want this job. He was so happy, you know, he is a military guy. He was doing this incredible job on the border and elsewhere, you know, he ran homeland like nobody has ever run it, down 78 percent of the border crossings. That is incredible. That is before the wall he there is nobody close. You go to the original first day, there was nobody close to doing the job. And I said I'd like to take you. How would you like it? And it is not that he wanted it. Actually, he would have preferred doing and staying where he was. He is a man that felt it would be important for the country. He does it for the country. He is not doing it for what he wants. He does it for the country. He is a very unusual man. So when she made that statement, I thought it was sickening, actually. I just want to ask you before I lose you, about the border. And you have said you want a legislative fix for DACA. What else do you need to see in terms of the border? What do you want overall What we are going to see we are working on DACA, we will see if we can get something with DACA. We have to build the wall, we have to all you have to do is look at what is happening in Mexico. We have to build a wall. Going to stop drug traffic in to a large extent. I mean, what is happening with drugs and I will be making a big announcement on that next week. What is happening with drugs in our country and by the way, in the world. It is not like we are singled out. But it is never been like this. And a lot of the drugs come through that southern border. And we need a wall. We are going to have a wall. We have to I would like to do something with DACA and we are negotiating, right with the Democrats, and we will see if we can come up with a solution. But I can tell you, I and the Republicans are very open to it. We have to get something in return. And last week on this program we had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Right. He commended you. He congratulated you for decertifying Iran in what you did last week. Do you think they are going to get Europeans to support you in terms of sanctions, in terms of not selling technology to Iran? Honestly, I told them. They are friends of mine. They really are. I get along with all of them. Whether it is Emmanuel, or whether it is Angela, I get along I really like those people. I told them, just keep making money. Do not worry about it. We do not need you on this. You just keep making money. When Iran buys things from Germany and from France and from the various by billions of dollars, even us, they were going to buy Boeings. I do not know what is going to happen with the deal. We will see what happens with the deal, but but when they buy those things, it is a little harder for those countries to do something. Would they do it if I really was insistent? I believe they would. I told them just keep making money. Do not worry. We do not need you on this one. And on North Korea, is our policy with China just about what it does with North Korea or do we have a separate policy with China for something else? China has been I have developed a very good relationship with President Xi. President Xi is right now going through his Congress and it is going to be something very soon is going to happen. Right. That gives him something that few leaders of China have ever had, and I am really good with that. And to be honest with I told you on this, I want to keep things very, very low key until such time as he gets that. I want him to get that. I think he deserves that. He is a good man. But they have been helping us. They are closing off their banking systems to North Korea. They have cut the oil way down. Now, the banking systems we can see, because they all come through here as you know. The oil you can never really see what is going on, but the oil is way down. The oil is they are doing a lot of things. For the first time ever For the first time ever. Those are the recent article that said I have the greatest relationship of any president the two of us, and I think we do. I really do. I think I do not want to be foolish. He is for China and I am for the U.S., OK? So we start off with that, but we do have a very good I would say an exceptional relationship. And China's really helping us, and well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China. China is big stuff. I believe he is got he is got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We will see what happens. Now with that being said, we are prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you would not believe. You would be shocked to see how totally prepared we are if we need to be. Would it be nice not to do that? The answer is yes. Will that happen? Who knows, who knows, ENTITY. ENTITY, would you like to add anything else that I may have missed? No. I am not I think you have covered just about everything... When we end, then where we begin and that is taxes. You cannot tell companies what to do, right? Are you sure they are going to get that savings in the taxes in terms of bringing that $3 trillion back and use it to hire people? Or are they going to buy back stock? Well, I think whatever they do, it is a positive. Honestly, whatever they do, it is a positive. Even if they buy back, they buy back and they give people money and the people are going to go spend the money, okay? And that is okay too. So you know that people have said that, oh, supposedly, they keep the money or supposedly, they buy back stock. Well, they buy back stock, the stock the money's going to people and they are going to go out and buy a something I will not say I was almost going to say something, but I will not say it. We have minimum, in my opinion, $3 trillion Overseas Overseas or however you define it. In some cases not necessarily totally over - but overseas. We have minimum $3 trillion it can never come back. You know what is interesting? That is something that Democrats for years. Democrats and republicans agree the money should come back. Who is not going to say the money should stay there, right? Everybody agrees I would say unanimously, it was never done, it was never done. Because of lack of leadership. Because of something. Now, it was not only the high tax it was a very high tax, nobody would pay it. I mean, unless you were desperate to get money, you would not pay it, so it was a high tax. It was also bureaucratic boondoggle; you never saw anything like it. You could not I looked at the amount of work you had to do to get that money in, aside from the tax OK, all of that is going to be solved and we are going to have 3 trillion and I think it could be much more than that. You know, we have been saying 2.5 trillion for years you have been saying it. For years, we have been saying 2.5 trillion well it is not 2.5 trillion anymore, I think it could be much more than that and it could be up to five, we will see. We are going to know fairly soon because for the most past, with the deeming and everything else that is going to come in very soon, I think it is going to come in very quickly. But there is at a minimum three $3 trillion coming into our country and that money is going to put to work one way or the other. So the great thing is, it is a great plan, there is never been anything like it, it is the biggest and it is the best and I think you are going to be very happy, you will be impressed. ENTITY thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. Thank you very much, ENTITY. So appreciated. I am so excited to be here. Oh, yes, is not ' it great? It is incredible. Ready? OK. So ENTITY, it is been nine months, have you changed? Have you changed being president? Well, I think you see the extent of what we have to do. And it is far greater than anybody would understand, whether its countries, or whether it is war and peace, and protection. The most important thing is protecting our people. And you protect them from lots of different things and elements. We have done a great job with ISIS. We have done a great job with - I think our military is getting stronger, stronger, stronger. I want to have it to a point where it is the strongest by far that has ever been. But number one is always going to be protection. But if you look at the economy - what we have done with the economy has been great. And regulations down to a level that nobody's ever seen. I mean nobody's done anything near what we have done. We have actually had a lot of legislation pass. A lot of people say, oh, gee, you have to get the taxes - you have to get the healthcare. They are two very biggies, but we have - we have passed legislation that I think more than almost any, out of the four to nine month period, more than any other president, they said Harry Truman - You have - but now we passed Harry Truman in this very short period of time - I look at the federal registry, you are absolutely right. Yes. You are down 30 percent. You mentioned the tax planning side. Can you give us any sense of this fifth bracket? I mean if you do a fifth a bracket, is that a million dollars, is it $2 million? Yes. What is the number? I do not think we will use a fifth bracket. I only want to use the fifth bracket if at any reason I feel the middle class is not getting as much as I thought they would or as much as they are entitled to. They are entitled to a lot. This is about the middle class. It is really about the middle class and about jobs. And if I feel that the middle class is not getting what I want them to get, and that is going to be a lot, because I want them to get really a lot. Then I am going to do a fifth bracket, which will give them more. ENTITY, thank you so much. Thank you very much. It is really good to see you. Great to have you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariabartiromofoxbusinessnetwork0", "title": "Interview with Maria Bartiromo of FOX Business Network", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-bartiromo-fox-business-network-0", "publication_date": "20-10-2017", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Donald J.

{"id": 114, "text": "Let us start with how the campaign has been going. Ever since the first debate, Romney has abruptly shifted his position on a whole host of issues, from his tax plan to financial regulation. He made a strong sales pitch for what I think are really wrongheaded plans. But the facts have not changed. The fundamentals have not changed. The essence of this race is, Do we have an economy that is building on all the work we have done over the last four years - an economy where we are focused on growing a strong, vibrant middle class, where we are focused on creating a strong manufacturing base here in the United States, where we are continuing to cut our imports of foreign oil, not only by developing homegrown oil and gas, but also by making sure that we are developing and taking leadership in clean energy? Are we going to continue to make investments in education that ensure that every kid in America has a shot at success if they are willing to work hard? Are we going to reduce our deficit in a way that is balanced and allows us to continue to make the investments that help us to grow? That is what I am putting forward. What Governor Romney's putting forward is a return to the very same policies that got us into this mess in the first place: tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and rollbacks of regulations that we fought very hard against lobbyists and special interests to put in place, to make sure that we do not have taxpayerfunded bailouts, to make sure that insurance companies are not taking advantage of folks who need health care, to make sure that we have a strong consumer advocate in place to protect people from unscrupulous lenders. So what I am absolutely sure about is that we have got the better argument. And Governor Romney understands that. It is the reason why, after a year and a half of campaigning on plans that very clearly were going to involve $5 trillion worth of tax cuts, he is trying to fog up the issues, because he knows that the American people are not buying what he is selling. Many observers have commented on how Romney has misrepresented or even changed his positions in this last leg of the campaign - that he is been like a chameleon on plaid. Do you feel that he has lied to the American people? What I think happened is that we won the battle of ideas during the course of the last year. His argument for a $5 trillion tax cut skewed toward the wealthy - which would necessarily involve either blowing up the deficit or increasing taxes on middle-class families - is not a recipe for growth. It will not create jobs, it will not reduce the deficit, and the American people understand that. So two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, they had to figure out, Is there some way that we can fuzz up what we have been proposing? In the first debate, he made as good a presentation as he could on what is a fundamentally flawed economic theory. What we are going to be focused on is making certain that he has to answer for those theories - ones that will not be good for the middle class and will not grow the economy long term. But understand, there is no doubt that what he has campaigned on for the last year is what he believes, because we have seen it before. We saw it when he was the governor of Massachusetts: His efforts to balance the budget involved raising taxes and fees on middle-class families, even as wealthy families were getting tax breaks, gutting investments in education and forcing costs down to local school districts and local communities. We saw it in how he answered a question on 60 Minutes as recently as two weeks ago, when he said he thought it was fair for someone like him, who is making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or bus driver making $50,000 a year. His basic theory is that if folks at the top are doing well and are unencumbered, that prosperity will rain down on everybody else, because they will make better decisions about allocating capital. I have got a different theory. I believe that when middle-class families are doing well - they have got money in their pockets, they are getting decent wages, they have got some health care security - then we all do better. Because those are customers who are buying goods and services, so businesses do better. It goes back to what Henry Ford understood when he decided to pay higher wages to his workers: that meant those workers on the assembly line making those Model T's could end up buying those cars. That is how we grew a middle class. So more than anything, our task over the next four weeks is just to lay bare just what these economic choices are. The American people are going to understand which choice is better for them and what is going to be better for the country as a whole. Where were you when you first saw Romney's speech in Boca Raton about the 47 percent? What was your first reaction? We were out campaigning. I do not remember which state we were in - probably Ohio. Since we have been there so often, the odds are, it was probably Ohio. It took a while before we actually saw the full transcript of what he said. I think it was pretty surprising. It is an indication of a story that Republicans have been telling themselves for a while, at least a sizable portion - that somehow, half the country consider themselves victims and want to be dependent on government. Obviously, he was wrong on the facts, since the overwhelming majority of that 47 percent are either folks that are working every day and paying all kinds of taxes but just do not earn enough money to pay income tax; or are senior citizens who worked all their lives and did everything right so they could count on some sense of security as they got older; or they are veterans who have sacrificed for our country, or soldiers who are sacrificing as we speak on behalf of our country. But that sense that folks who have contributed to this country but are at the lower ends of the income scale are somehow looking for government to do something for them, or feel some sense of entitlement, is just fundamentally wrong. It does not jive with what I see as I travel across the country every day. Are there people who, both at the top and the bottom, are not pulling their weight and are looking for a special deal? Sure. But as was pointed out when this controversy erupted, there are a whole bunch of millionaires who are not paying any income tax, as well as people at the lower end of the income spectrum who may be taking advantage of the safety net that we have put in place. We should hold everybody accountable who is not doing their fair share. That is what the American people believe: They do not like bailouts, they do not like handouts, but they do understand that we have to have a government that ensures that if somebody is working hard and carrying out their responsibilities, that they can succeed and that they can give the prospects of a better life to their kids and their grandkids. What has surprised you the most about the Republican campaign this year? What was interesting was the degree to which Governor Romney was willing to embrace the most extreme positions in the Republican Party: on immigration, on environmental issues, on women's issues and on the economy. Frankly, I think that is telling when you start thinking about the presidency. If you cannot say no to certain elements of your party, if you do not have sets of principles that you are willing to fight for, even if they are not politically convenient, then you are gonna have a tough time in this office. It was only at a point where it was determined that the American people had soundly rejected those views that you started seeing him try to fuzz up those positions. But they remain his positions. He continues to believe, when it comes to immigration, that the Arizona law is a model for the nation, and that self-deportation is the answer. When it comes to women's health issues, he continues to believe that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. He would be supportive of a constitutional amendment overturning a woman's right to choose, would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, is supportive of legislation that would allow employers to make determinations as to whether women could get contraception through their insurance companies. Four weeks out from an election, you cannot hide from positions that ultimately are out of sync with how the majority of Americans think. I guarantee if you talk to not just Democratic women, but a whole bunch of Republican and Independent women, they will tell you they are very capable of making their own health care decisions. If you have a chance to meet these Dream Act kids, some of whom were brought here when they were two or three or five, and are American in every sense, except for their papers - love this country, have pledged allegiance to this flag, want to contribute - then you would reject the idea that somehow they should be deported to some country where they have never been. But those are Governor Romney's positions, and we gotta make sure that the American people understand those positions. Do you have any fear that Roe v. Wade could be overturned if the Republicans win the presidency and appoint another Supreme Court justice? I do not think there is any doubt. Governor Romney has made clear that is his position. His running mate has made this one of the central principles of his public life. Typically, ENTITY is going to have one or two Supreme Court nominees during the course of his presidency, and we know that the current Supreme Court has at least four members who would overturn Roe v. Wade. All it takes is one more for that to happen. How do you feel about Justice Roberts' ruling on the Affordable Care Act? Were you surprised? I was not surprised. I was always confident that the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, was constitutional. It was interesting to see them, or Justice Roberts in particular, take the approach that this was constitutional under the taxing power. The truth is that if you look at the precedents dating back to the 1930s, this was clearly constitutional under the Commerce Clause. I think Justice Roberts made a decision that allowed him to preserve the law but allowed him to keep in reserve the desire, maybe, to scale back Congress' power under the Commerce Clause in future cases. What made you so certain that the law was constitutional? It is hard to dispute that health care is a national issue of massive importance. It takes up 17 or 18 percent of our entire economy; it touches on everybody's lives; it is a massive burden on businesses, on our federal budget and on families. It is practiced across state lines. So the notion that Congress could not take a comprehensive approach to that problem the way we have makes no sense. I am very proud of the steps we have taken already: making sure that insurance companies cannot impose lifetime limits that could leave families high and dry if somebody gets a severe illness. Parents being able to keep their kids on their own plans until they are 26 years old. The rebates that are already going out to customers because we have said to insurance companies that you have got to spend the dollars you collect in premiums on actually providing care, not just on overhead and CEO salaries. The $600 a year that seniors are saving on their prescription drugs. The tax breaks we are providing small businesses in order to provide health insurance for their families. The cost-control measures that are trying to develop better ways of providing care. All those things are already happening. By 2014, people who have pre-existing conditions or individuals who are paying 18 or 20 percent more for health insurance than somebody on a big group plan - they are going to have a chance to get affordable care, and we will provide tax credits to the folks who need it. So this is a model that we know can work. It is working in Massachusetts right now - you have 98 percent of adults and 99.5 percent of kids in Massachusetts with health insurance. For the greatest nation on Earth not to make sure that people are not going bankrupt when they get sick - that was a blot on our society. And for us to take this step forward is something that is really going to make a big difference for millions of families for decades to come. It also gives us our best opportunity to start really going after the waste and inefficiencies of the system, so that we can start cutting back on the health care inflation that is driving our deficit and hurting families and businesses every single day. You said, a.k.a. Obamacare. Do you mind if historians call the achievement Obamacare? I will be very proud. Because I am confident that I am going to win this election, and that we are going to implement it over the next four years. Just like Medicare and Social Security, as time goes on, as people see what it does, as it gets refined and improved, people will say, This was the last piece to our basic social compact - providing people with some core security from the financial burdens of an illness or bad luck. You sometimes use the term fair shake. FDR had the New Deal, Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society. Is the Fair Shake something you'd be comfortable with to describe your legacy? I'd be comfortable with that, and hearing it from a historian, it sounds pretty good to me. But look, the key thing I have tried to communicate, and I will continue to try to communicate to the American people, is that when you talk about economic fairness, it is not just an issue of fairness - it is also an issue of growth. It is how the economy succeeds. Republicans, and certainly Mitt Romney, often tries to frame this as Obama's a redistributionist, whereas we want to grow the pie instead of taking from Peter to pay Paul. But look at our history: When we have been successful, it is because everybody is in on the action. Everybody feels a sense of ownership, because everybody is benefitting from rising productivity, everybody is benefitting from a growing economy. When prosperity is broad-based, it is stable, it is steady, it is robust. But when you have just a few people at the very top benefitting from what we do together as an economy, then growth gets constrained. On one end, you have got a lot of money in the hands of a very few people who are speculating and engaging in a lot of financial transactions that can get our economy in trouble. We saw that in 2007 and 2008. On the other end, you have got middle-income people and low-income people who are overextended, taking on too much debt, and that can create problems. You do not have enough customers to buy the products and services that are being produced, so businesses then pull back and you get into a negative cycle. When the opposite is the case, you get into a virtuous cycle, and that is what we are constantly trying to push. The success we have had, although we have got a long way to go, is based on making sure that everybody feels they have got a stake in the system. Look at what happened in the auto industry: You have got management and workers coming together, everybody making some sacrifices. Suddenly, what was an industry on the brink of collapse is now resurgent. GM's on top again, Chrysler is making profits like it has not made before, all the supplier chains that employ people all across the Midwest are benefitting. And that model, I think, is one that the American people instinctively get. The auto bailout helped rescue states like Ohio from economic disaster. What, in turn, have you learned from the people of Ohio during your many visits to the state? They just want to work hard, but they want to make sure that hard work is rewarded. When you go into these auto plants, you get folks who not only have been working at the plant for 15 years, their dad worked at the plant, sometimes their grandfather worked at the plant. It is not just a paycheck for them - they really take great pride in making great products, making a great car. One plant we went to, a bunch of workers had just won the lottery, and they were still showing up to work every single day. One of them had bought his wife one of the cars he had made, for her birthday, and he had bought flags for his entire town, because he was proud of his country and there was no place he'd rather be. That is what you see in Ohio, that is what you see across the country. People want to work hard, they want to feel like they are contributing, they want to feel like they are helping to build the country. All they want is just a chance. Have you ever read Ayn Rand? Sure. What do you think Paul Ryan's obsession with her work would mean if he were vice president? Well, you'd have to ask Paul Ryan what that means to him. Ayn Rand is one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we'd pick up. Then, as we get older, we realize that a world in which we are only thinking about ourselves and not thinking about anybody else, in which we are considering the entire project of developing ourselves as more important than our relationships to other people and making sure that everybody else has opportunity - that that is a pretty narrow vision. It is not one that, I think, describes what is best in America. Unfortunately, it does seem as if sometimes that vision of a you are on your own society has consumed a big chunk of the Republican Party. Of course, that is not the Republican tradition. I made this point in the first debate. You look at Abraham Lincoln: He very much believed in self-sufficiency and self-reliance. He embodied it - that you work hard and you make it, that your efforts should take you as far as your dreams can take you. But he also understood that there is some things we do better together. That we make investments in our infrastructure and railroads and canals and land-grant colleges and the National Academy of Sciences, because that provides us all with an opportunity to fulfill our potential, and we will all be better off as a consequence. He also had a sense of deep, profound empathy, a sense of the intrinsic worth of every individual, which led him to his opposition to slavery and ultimately to signing the Emancipation Proclamation. That view of life - as one in which we are all connected, as opposed to all isolated and looking out only for ourselves - that is a view that has made America great and allowed us to stitch together a sense of national identity out of all these different immigrant groups who have come here in waves throughout our history. If Americans re-elect you, what will be different in your second term? What is your plan to avoid four more years of gridlock? It is important for people to understand how much we have gotten done, because sometimes folks obsess with gridlock and the ugliness of the process here in Washington. We passed health care - something that presidents have tried to do for 100 years, and we will implement it. We passed the toughest Wall Street reform since the 1930s, and we will implement it and continue to strengthen it. We have put in place a Consumer Finance Protection Agency that is going to be an ongoing advocate for every American out there who is involved in a financial transaction, saving people billions of dollars. We have expanded access to college through the Pell Grant program and by keeping student loans low. The list of things that we have accomplished, even once the Republicans took over, is significant. Now, there are some things that are undone. We are going to have to get a handle on our deficit and debt, but we need to do it in a balanced way that does not simply stick it to middle-class families. I am confident we can get that accomplished, in part, because the Bush tax cuts lapse at the end of this year, and we will have a showdown about how we are going to fund the government that we need to grow in a sensible way, in a balanced way. Immigration reform I believe we will get done, because the Republican Party will start recognizing that alienating the fastestgrowing segments of our society is probably not good politics for them - not to mention the fact that immigration reform is the right thing to do. On energy and climate change, we will continue to develop oil and natural-gas resources, but we will build off the work we have done, doubling fuel-efficiency standards on cars and doubling the investment we have made in clean energy. There is a huge opportunity for us to focus on energy efficiency in our buildings, in our schools and in our residences. If we can make our economy as energy efficient as Japan, say, we would be cutting our greenhouse emissions by 20 percent and saving consumers billions of dollars every single year. And by the way, we can put a whole bunch of construction workers back to work in the process. Internationally, having ended the war in Iraq, I am now committed to ending the war in Afghanistan by 2014. Doing that in a responsible way will have a huge impact, because we are also going to be able to take the money we have saved on war to do some nation-building here at home. We are going to have a full agenda in the second four years, but people should not underestimate how much we can get done. Obviously, I'd love to see a shift in Congress where we are electing people who are less interested in the next election and obstruction and are more interested in getting stuff done. And that is true whether it is Republicans or Democrats. I just want to make sure that there are people who have some sense of service toward their constituencies. Forget for a moment about obstruction by Wall Street lobbyists and Republicans in Congress. If you could single-handedly enact one piece of regulation on the financial industry, what would it be? The story of Dodd-Frank is not yet complete, because the rules are still being developed. Dodd-Frank provided a platform to make sure that we end some of the most egregious practices and prevent another taxpayer-funded bailout. We have significantly increased capital requirements and essentially created a wind-down mechanism for institutions that make bad bets, so the whole system is not held hostage to them going under. We have to make sure that the rules issued around the Volcker Rule are actually enforced. So there is a lot of good work that will be done around Dodd-Frank. I have looked at some of Rolling Stone's articles that say, This did not go far enough, we did not institute Glass-Steagall and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. But there is not evidence that having Glass-Steagall in place would somehow change the dynamic. Lehman Brothers was not a commercial bank, it was an investment bank. AIG was not an FDIC-insured bank, it was an insurance institution. So the problem in today's financial sector cannot be solved simply by reimposing models that were created in the 1930s. I will tell you, the single biggest thing that I would like to see is changing incentives on Wall Street and how people get compensated. That ultimately requires not just congressional legislation but a change in corporate governance. You still have a situation where people making bets can get a huge upside, and their downsides are limited. So it tilts the whole system in favor of very risky behavior. I think a legitimate concern, even after Dodd-Frank, is, Have we completely changed those incentives? When investment banks, for example, were partnerships, as opposed to corporations, all those partners understood that if there was some tail risk out there - some unanticipated event that might result in the whole firm blowing up - that they were going to lose all their money, they were going to lose all their assets. They were not protected. These days, you have got guys who are making five years of risky bets, but it is making them $100 million every year. By the time the chicken comes home to roost, they are still way ahead of the game. So I think it is something that needs to be discussed. But that is not something that can entirely be legislated - that is something that also has to involve shareholders and boards of directors being better stewards of their institutions. Bill Clinton - how important is he as a surrogate for you? What is your friendship with him like these days? Our relationship is terrific. He did a masterful job, obviously, at the convention. He has been a tireless surrogate on our behalf. I am talking to him regularly, and he is given me good advice. Not only is he a great politician, but he is also somebody who has a lot of credibility with the public when it comes to how the economy works. Because the last time we had healthy, broad-based growth was when he was president, and people remember that. So he can say things that people immediately grab on to. And one of the things he said during the convention that I thought was very helpful was to put this whole economic crisis in context. The biggest challenge we have always had is that unlike FDR - who came into office when the economy had already bottomed out, so people understood that everything done subsequent to his election was making things better - I came in just as we were sliding. Because of the actions we took, we averted a Great Depression - but in the process, we also muddied up the political narrative, because it allowed somebody like Romney to somehow blame my policies for the mess that the previous administration created. Bill Clinton can point that out in ways that are really helpful and really powerful. Halloween's coming up. If you could have Mitt Romney dress in a costume, what should he be for Halloween? I do not know about this Halloween. Next Halloween I hope he will be an ex-presidential candidate.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdouglasbrinkleyrollingstone", "title": "Interview with Douglas Brinkley of Rolling Stone", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-douglas-brinkley-rolling-stone", "publication_date": "11-10-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 348, "text": "What is the most important thing you have learned about your two years here? : You know, I will get knocked down a couple of times; but whatever I am going through, it is nothing like what families around the country are going through. And if they are able to keep going, even when things do not go the way they want, then I sure can as well. We spoke to in the Oval Office exactly two years to the day after he was elected , and two days after he suffered his worst political defeat: : What I am going to do is I am going to reach out to Republican -- What can we work on together? But the Republican leadership is not eager to compromise, and finds himself reevaluating where he goes from here, and reflecting on his first two years in office. Do you think you were naive? is on a trade mission in India tonight, following a long flight, and an even longer week which saw him lose his Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and nearly lose it in the Senate. Although his name was not on the ballot, his performance in office was certainly a factor in the outcome. Late on Thursday afternoon, two years to the date after his election as the 44th , we sat down with him in the Oval Office and the mood was different. We talked about Tuesday's vote, the economy, and where he goes from here. The Republicans have said this was a referendum on you and the Democratic Party. Do you agree with that? : I think, first and foremost, it was a referendum on the economy, and the party in power was held responsible for an economy that is still underperforming and where a lot of folks are still hurting. At your news conference you seemed unwilling to accept the idea that this was a rejection, in any way, of your agenda and your policies. Is this defeat a reflection on your leadership? : I think that what happened over the course of two years was that we had to take a series of big emergency steps quickly, and most of them in the first six months of my administration. Each of them had a big price tag, and people looked at that and they said, Boy, this feels as if there is a huge expansion of government. And what -- Well, it was a huge expansion of government. : What I did not effectively, I think, drive home is that we were taking these steps not because of some theory that we wanted to expand government; it was because we had an emergency situation and we wanted to make sure the economy did not go off a cliff. I think the Republicans were able to paint my governing philosophy as a classic, traditional, big-government liberal, and that is not something that the American people want. The Republicans say the voters sent you a very clear message -- that they want a smaller, less costly, more accountable government. Is that the message that you received? : I think that the -- first and foremost, they want jobs and economic growth in this country. Are you saying, then, that this small -- idea of smaller, less costly, more accountable government was not what you think the voters were saying? : No, no, no. There is no doubt that folks are concerned about debt and deficits. I think that is absolutely a priority. And, by the way, that is a concern that I had before I was every sworn in. You lost a lot of your base on Tuesday. A lot of the people that helped elect you two years ago voted for Republicans -- women, senior citizens, independents; young people and African- Americans did not turn out in large numbers. How do you explain that? : Well, as I said, I think that folks are frustrated with what they have seen over the last two years. You know, one of the challenges we had was that we had lost 4 million jobs in the six months before I was sworn in; we lost 750,000 jobs the month I was sworn in; 600,000 the month after that; 600,000 the month after that. So what you -- what you had was the economy continuing to get worse in the first several months of my administration, before any of our economic policies had a chance to be put into place. Appropriately, I am held accountable for that. You ran as somebody who was going to come to Washington and change it, and in the end, as some of your predecessors, it ended up changing you -- : You know, I -- -- to a certain extent. : I am not -- You have not given up. : Exactly. I think it is fair to say it has not changed me in terms of my ideals. But I think that in terms of how I operated on a day-to-day basis, when you have got a series of choices to make, I think that were are times where we said, Let us just get it done, instead of worrying about how we are getting it done. And I think that is a problem. I am paying a political price for that. Well, to a certain extent, the Tea Party and some of the Republicans ran on the same message, or much of the same message that you ran on two years ago, which is, We are going to change Washington, and now you are Washington. : Well, that is one of the dangers of assuming power. And, you know, when you are campaigning I think you are liberated to say things without thinking about, Okay, how am I going to actually, practically implement this? Do you think you were naive? : No, I do not think I was naive; I just think that these things are hard to do. You know, this is a big country, and democracy is an inherently messy business; and Congress is an institution that has a whole lot of tradition, some of them that are not , you know, all that healthy; and there are a lot of special interests who've got a lot of power. It is a hard, long slog to push up against that. But I think you make a good point, ENTITY, which is that you now have a lot of Republicans who ran as outsiders who are coming in, and my hope is, is that we may be in a position now where the two sides meet and agree on some things that need to be changed. is talking about ear marks -- billions of dollars in political pork dispensed each year by the congressional leadership. The Tea Party and conservative Republicans want to end the practice, and is now ready to help them, even though he tolerated ear marks to pass key legislation. He says it was just one of his regrets. Are there things that you wish you could do over? : Oh, I think -- Pull back? : -- I think there are things every day that I think about doing better. I mean, I think that one of the areas that a lot of folks have focused on, obviously, is the health-care bill. Right. : Because, after we took a whole series of these emergency measures to save the economy -- the stimulus, the steps to shore up the banking system, the auto bailout -- I think there were some that argued, well, you should just stop and let people digest all these changes. And so you should not take on something as big as health care. And I will be honest with you, ENTITY, at the time, we knew that it probably was not great politics, because -- You were told that by your aides. : Absolutely. And the reason is, is -- there is a reason why our health-care system has not been reformed over the last several decades, why every president talks about it and it never happens, because it is hard. It is a huge, big, complicated system. I made the decision to go ahead and do it, and it proved as costly politically as we expected -- probably actually a little more costly than we expected, politically. In what ways? : Well, partly because I could not get the kind of cooperation from Republicans that I had hoped for. We thought that if we shaped a bill that was not that different from bills that had previously been introduced by Republicans, including the Republican governor in Massachusetts who is now running for president, that we would be able to find some common ground there, and we just could not . And that was costly party because it created the kind of partisanship and bickering that really turned people off. You have mentioned a couple of times the emergency that you faced when you came into office, and you have mentioned continually the unemployment problem and the economy. This emergency -- is it over? : Not for the people who are out of work. I think that the way to think about it is the dangers of a second Big Recession are now much reduced; the danger of us tipping into a Great Depression, I think most economists would say, is not -- is not out there on the horizon. What is a danger is that we stay stuck in a new normal, where unemployment rates stay high. People who have jobs see their incomes go up, businesses make big profits; but they have learned to do more with less, and so they do not hire. And as a consequence, we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the 8 million jobs that were lost. That is a danger. So that is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. Do you get discouraged? Are you discouraged now? : I do get discouraged. I mean, were times when I thought that the economy would have gotten better by now. You know, one of the things I think you understand, as , is you are held responsible for everything, but you do not always have control over everything; and especially in an economy this big, there are limited tools to encourage the kind of job growth that we need. I am constantly reminded that we have been through worse times than these and we have always come out on top. And I am positive that the same thing is going to happen this time. You spent nearly a trillion dollars on the stimulus package; you have got short -- short-term interest rates are zero -- practically zero, and still the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. What can you do to create jobs that has not already been done? : Some of this is going to be just a matter of the economy healing. There are some things we can do to accelerate growth. We still -- we have got a couple of trillion dollars worth of infrastructure improvements that need to be made around the country. I mean, there are construction crews all across the country that are dying for work, and companies that are willing to take a very small profit to get work done. And so for us to say, Now is the time for us to rebuild this country and equip ourselves for the 21st century, that is something that could make a real difference. But -- But the Republicans are not interested in spending and infrastructure right now. They do not want stimulus programs. : Well, you know, again, historically, rebuilding our infrastructure is something that has garnered Democratic and Republican support. I want to have a conversation with them and see if that is still the case. The political landscape has changed. I mean, how do you plan to govern? President Clinton found himself in a very, very similar circumstance, and he reacted by pivoting to the middle, and was successful in it. Is that what you are going to do? : Well, I -- what I -- You have to, do not you. : -- what I am going to do is I am going to reach out to Republicans, and I am going to say there is -- What can we work on together? And -- Have not you tried that? : Well, I have, but I am going to keep on trying. But, so far, the Republicans are not showing much interest. No sooner than had left on his trip to Asia, Republican Congressman John Boehner, the next speaker of the House, questioned whether had gotten the voters' message. Boehner and Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, oppose any new spending and vowed to repeal or decimate health-care reform and slash more than $100 billion from next year's budget. Tea Party activists are demanding even deeper cuts. The Tea Party -- according to the exit polls, four out of 10 voters on Tuesday said they supported the movement. How seriously do you take the Tea Party, and will it make the task of finding common ground with the Republican Party more difficult? : Well, it'll be interesting to see how it evolves. We have a long tradition in this country of a desire for limited government, of a suspicion of the federal government, of a concern that government spends too much money. You know, I mean, that is as American as apple pie. But you are still confronted with the fact that the vast majority of the federal budget are things that people really think are important, like Social Security, and Medicare and defense. I mean, we are going to have to, you know, tackle some big issues, like entitlements, that, you know, when you -- when you listen to the Tea Party, or you listen to Republican candidates, they promise We are not going to touch. Those are the choices that I think Republicans and Tea Party members are going to have to confront in a serious way. You have -- I would say, do not have a very close relationship with Mr. McConnell -- Senator McConnell and Congressman Boehner. What do you think of these guys? : Both John and Mitch are very smart; they are capable; they have been able to I think organize the Republican Caucus very effectively in opposition to a lot of the things that we tried to do over the last two years, and that takes real political skill. You know, my assumption is, is that we are going to be able to work together. And whenever we have had conversations -- here at the White House or over on Capitol Hill, they have always been cordial. It is just in the newspapers that they have been -- : Well -- -- less than cordial. : Okay, the -- during election season, I think the rhetoric flies. And by the way, I have been guilty of that; it is not just them. Part of my promise to the American people when I was elected was to maintain the kind of tone that says we can disagree without being disagreeable, and I think over the course of two years there have been times where I have slipped on that commitment. When we come back, talks about his upcoming negotiations with the Republican leadership over tax cuts, affecting nearly every American, that are about to expire, and considers whether, halfway through his term, he is lost his mojo. 's next big challenge, working with the Republicans, will begin in two weeks when he meets with the congressional leadership. The Bush-era tax cuts automatically expire at the end of year unless Congress renews them. wants to keep the tax breaks for middle-class families earning less than $250,000 a year; he would let them expire for wealthier taxpayers. The Republicans want the tax cuts extended for everyone to keep the economy moving. Are you ready to compromise on the Bush tax cuts? : I think we are going to have to have a serious conversation about it. Here is an example where I'd like to think we could at least settle on those things we agree on. I think both Democrats and Republicans agree that for people making $250,000 a year or less, the last thing we want right now is to see their taxes go up. Not only would it be bad for them, but it'd be bad for the economy as a whole. For folks who are making more than $250,000 a year -- you and me, ENTITY -- you know, the question is: Can we afford to borrow $700 billion -- That is what it is? : -- that is how much it would cost over the course of 10 years -- to give us an extra tax break? Look, you know, sometimes I think this debate gets framed as if I think rich people -- folks who are doing well, should be punished. Part of what America is all about is going out there and getting rich. And, you know, if you make a good product, you provide a good service, god bless you, I want you to do well. That is -- and then you can plow that money back into creating jobs, and building your businesses -- that is terrific. What I -- what I do not think makes sense is for us to borrow $700 billion to pay for that. And we do not have the money. I mean, everybody's already talking about our deficit; why would we want to add to it? Now, having said all that, I understand -- The Republicans want everybody -- : -- I understand the -- -- to get it. : -- I understand the Republicans have a different view. And so we are going to have to have a negotiation, and I am open to, you know, finding a way in which they can meet their principles and I can meet mine. But in order to do that, I think we do have to answer the question of how we pay for it. Congressman Boehner has offered you a compromise back in September. He suggested extending the tax break for the wealthiest for two more years, and rolling back the discretionary government spending to levels before the bailout in 2008. Is that something that you could live with? : I think that when we start getting specific like that, there is a basis for a conversation. I think that what that means is, is that, you know, we can look at what the budget projections are; we can think about what the economy needs right now, given that it is still weak; and hopefully we can agree on a set of facts that leads to a compromise. Do you want to make a counterproposal to him right now? : I think -- I have already invited them over to the White House, and, you know, there are going to be a bunch of discussions. But I think -- I think we can make progress on this. The point of view of a lot of people is why would you want to tax or raise taxes on the people who have money to spend -- not necessarily the wealthiest people in America; you are not talking about Goldman Sachs here, you are talking about small business people who maybe make $250,000 a year? : Well -- Why would you want to take that money back when you are looking to try -- and they have got money to spend, to put it into the economy? : Well, the truth is, is that the way this thing works out, it is folks who are millionaires and billionaires who get the biggest breaks. And it turns out that actually the people who are most likely to use that money and spend that money are actually people of more modest means. And if what we are concerned about how we can grow the economy, there are more efficient ways to recirculate dollars out there and get people to spend. This is a perception out there that you are anti business. : Well, I think there is no doubt that the relationship with the business community, over the course of the last two years, at times has gotten strained. And so I think that we have got some repair to do there. These were exceptional circumstances over the last two years. I think we have to make sure that people understand and business understands that my overarching philosophy is not one in which we have constantly increasing government intervention; although I do think that some of the provisions we put in place to protect consumers, to create a regulatory framework where we do not have a repeat of the kind of crisis we had in the banking sector, those have to be preserved. One of the things that is -- that drives business crazy is this idea that they do not know what is going on. They have trouble planning. They do not know what the tax rate is going to be. They are not convinced that things are getting better. : Well, there are two separate arguments here. I think a lot of businesses still do not know what the economy is doing -- there is still a lot of uncertain data out there; and we are still working through some big problems in the economy -- the housing market is a huge headwind. Now the second part of uncertainty -- and this is the one the Republicans focused a lot on during the campaign -- is we got a new health-care law, we have got a new financial regulatory reform law, we do not know what all these regulations coming out of various agencies might be, and so that is making people hesitate. And, you know, I think that it is entirely legitimate that -- in the banking sector, let us say, it is very important for us to write these rules in collaboration with interested parties so that they can start knowing how things are going to work; when it comes to health care, we need to be consulting with the insurance industry to make sure they know how things are going to work. There is this feeling, particularly among people who are among your most ardent supporters, who feel a little disappointed, that they think that you have lost your mojo -- -- that you have lost your ability, that touch you had during the camping to inspire and lead, that -- you know, everybody in Washington writes about the, sort of, aloofness that you have. And I am sure that drives you crazy -- that you have let other people define you, that you have not sold your successes well enough. : I think it is -- I think it is a fair argument. You know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, yeah, leadership is not just legislation, that it is a matter of persuading people, and giving them confidence, and bringing them together, and setting a tone. We have not always been successful at that, and I take personal responsibility for that, and it is something that I have got to examine carefully as I go forward. I will say that, when it comes to some of my supporters, part of it I think is the belief that if I'd just communicated things better, that I'd be able to persuade that half of the country that voted for John McCain that we were right and they were wrong. You know, one of the things that I think it is important for people to remember is that, you know, this country does not just agree with The New York Times editorial page; and, you know, I can make some really good arguments defending the Democratic position, and there are going to be some people who just do not agree me, and that is okay. One thing that is not been okay with a lot of people has been his eagerness to spread that gospel to the far reaches of the broadcast cable universe. It seems like he has been almost everywhere -- Leno, and Letterman, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, America's Most Wanted, and The View. Some find it demeaning and unpresidential. I do not know if you saw this cartoon. : Let me take a look at it. Body by Bam -- : Body by Bam -- -- from the Daily News. : The challenge right now -- and you know this better than I do, ENTITY -- is that it used to be ENTITY could call a press conference, and the three major networks would come, and he'd talk to them, and he pretty much reached everybody in America. And these days the closest I can get to that is being on 60 Minutes. But there are a whole bunch of folks who watch The Daily Show, or watch The View, and so I have got to adapt the presidency to reach as many people as possible, in as many settings as possible, so that they can hear directly from me. You know, but this is an example where, you know, on the one hand folks say, Well, you know, he is a little too remote; then if I am on The View, Well, you know, he should not be, you know, on some day- time TV show. My attitude is, if I am reaching people, if I am talking to them, I am willing to take the risks of overexposure on that front. You are halfway through -- just about halfway through your first term. What is the most important thing you have learned about, in two years here, about yourself, about the job? : You know, I think that I have learned that America is incredibly resilient. I think I have learned about myself that I am pretty resilient too; you know, that, you know, I will get knocked down a couple of times, but whatever I am going through, it is nothing like what families around the country are going through. And if they are able to keep going, even when things do not go the way they want, then I sure can as well.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevekroftcbs60minutes0", "title": "Interview With Steve Kroft on CBS 60 Minutes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-kroft-cbs-60-minutes-0", "publication_date": "07-11-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 273, "text": "Welcome back to another hour of The ENTITY Show. Great pleasure to have with us-the last time we had him on a radio show he was in a car in Detroit during the campaign, getting to the airport. In fact, he gave us a visual description of the highway. Do you remember that? I do remember it. ENTITY, a couple of things. First, Senator Phil Gramm last week on my television show said-the Republican from Texas-anytime, anywhere, anyplace he will come to The White House, he will meet with you, he will sit down to work out a deal on the economy from the Republican Party standpoint. He said, you invite him, he is there. What about it? I am always happy to talk to Senator Gramm, but the issue is, what are they for? I mean, there at least was a Republican budget offered in the House of Representatives, and more Republicans voted against it than Democrats voted against my budget. There was a bipartisan budget offered in the Senate Finance Committee which by common consent probably could not get 20 votes on the floor of the Senate. So what I want to know is, what are they for? I have met with the Republican Senators completely. I meet with the leadership of the Republicans along with the Democrats all the time. I am always anxious to discuss this. But we need to know what the specifics are. I mean, I put out a plan that has $250 billion in tax cuts in it that affects agriculture, veterans, defense, foreign aid, the Federal employee pay, Federal employee retirement, cuts huge amounts out of all these things. They have been trying to convince the American people that there are no spending cuts. Senator Gramm tried to do it in his own State of Texas in the recent election season. So, if we are going to have anything to talk about, we have all got to at least say what the facts are. All I am saying is I'd be happy to have any suggestions he has, but we have got to know where we are going on this. You are saying it would be pointless to sit down unless they come in with a preagenda? The Senate Finance Committee met last week on the economic plan and dealt with a lot of Republican amendments after they went all over the country saying the issue was spending. The Republicans tried to lower taxes in a lot of different ways, mostly on upper income folks. And everything they offered would have increased the deficit because they did not introduce one single spending cut amendment, because those are the tough and controversial things, because they know how much we have already cut spending in this budget. So, all I am saying is, you know, I will talk to Phil Gramm; I will talk to anybody. He may want to talk to me this week because I am trying to save the space station and the super collider in his State, two things I believe in. After having shaved down the space station by $4 billion and shaved the cost of the super collider some, I believe they are important for America as investments in science and technology. But there are a lot of people who are against these projects who are going to try to take his rhetoric and the rhetoric of the recent Texas election and use it against him because of the things they said. So, Senator Gramm may need me this week because I agree with him on this issue, and I hope we can save them for America's sake. But the political rhetoric of some of the Republicans in pretending that there are no spending cuts has made it tougher. So in other words, what everybody wants is, they do not want to pay new taxes; they do not want to cut any services. We just want a free ride. Yes, and we want to do it in a way that looks politically palatable. So they talk about, well, let us put a cap on all this spending or limits on all that and not come up with the specifics. My budget has 200 specific spending cuts over the previous Bush budget. A hundred of them are more than $100 million a piece. And I really have tried to take this thing on. For years we listened to all this rhetoric about how we could cut taxes and increase spending and somehow everything would be all fight. And we took the debt from $1 trillion to $4 trillion. We had astronomical long-term interest rates. Ever since we have been trying to bring the interest rates down by bringing the deficit down, you see mortgage rates at a 20-year low, housing starts at a 7-year high; construction employment is increased at the highest rate in 9 years. We have got 755,000 new jobs coming into the economy. Most of them are coming in because people are refinancing their debt and freeing up money to invest in the economy. So we are moving this in the fight direction. But of course, it is not popular to do these difficult things. You are going to have to go to Japan in a couple weeks. That is a major economic conference. Let us assume the Senate passes this; then they go to House committee, and that of course will not be settled by the time you go there. And you go to a country where their leadership is going to change. How much of a ball of wax is that? Well, it is going to be a challenge to get a lot done at this summit. But I am convinced we can. We have two or three issues that we really need to deal with. We are trying to come to grips with the need for a new trade agreement for the world, which I think is very important, will create more jobs in America. We'd have more jobs today if Europe and Japan were not in the bad economics conditions they are in. Their growth rates are substantially lower than ours. If they were in better shape, they'd be buying more of our products and we'd have more jobs. The second thing we are going to try to deal with is what we can do, each in our own countries, to promote global economic growth. The Europeans and Japanese have been telling America for years, Get your deficit down. So we are doing that. Now they have got to lower their interest rates in Europe so they can grow, and they have got to invest some more money in Japan so they can grow and buy more of our products. And if we do it together, we can bring this world out of the recession it is in, and that means more jobs for America. But what part does Japan play if they are lame duck? Well, I think that depends upon what all the political sides in the country will say about the negotiations that we are on. I mean, it is pretty clear to me that no matter who winds up being Prime Minister of Japan and what faction that person comes out of, that they are going to have to continue to open their economy to our products. And they are going to have to continue to stimulate their economy, because they do not have a budget deficit, they have got a surplus. What is happening in Japan now I think has more than anything else to do with the legacy of the various political scandals and the political corruption. I think their economic policy is going to have to take the direction that we support almost no matter who gets elected Prime Minister. They cannot withdraw from the world or shut us out now. They have got too much at stake in expanding into China and other countries and doing business in a very complicated world that simply will not allow Japan to be the only rich country in the world with $110 billion a year trade surplus. So you are hopeful, no matter who it is? Yes, I am. It presents a challenge to get done the things I wanted to get done in Japan at the conference. It will be more challenging, but I still think that we may be able to do that simply because of the limits on their economic options. During the campaign you told me, in fact, almost the day it happened, when President Bush signed it in San Antonio, you said to me the next day that you supported this fair trade concept with Mexico and Canada on balance. You had some questions. Do you still have some questions? Yes, but I am still for it. As a matter of fact, I feel more strongly today, if possible, that it is the right direction for us to take. The trade agreement, I thought, had some weaknesses. It was negotiated with a greater concern for our financial institutions and our intellectual property concerns, that is, patent and copyright concerns, than for new jobs and environmental cleanup, things that I thought were real important. So we are trying to fix that. We are trying to make sure that this trade agreement with Mexico and Canada has very strong provisions to guarantee appropriate investments in environmental cleanups, so we do not have more pollution in America or we do not have people going down to Mexico just so they will not have to have any antipollution expenses, and so we have some labor protections. But I think we are getting there. And I believe that the right kind of trade agreement can create jobs in America. I do not agree that it'll cost jobs. If you look just in the last couple of days, there was a notice from General Motors that they are closing an operation in Mexico, bringing it back to the United States, going to create 1,000 jobs in Michigan and higher labor costs because of the productivity and the nearness to the labor parts market, to the auto parts market. And I think you are going to see a lot of that. If anybody wants to shut a plant down and go to Mexico just because they have cheap wages, they can do that today. Nothing is going to change in the NAFTA agreement. But if you have more growth on both sides, then you will have less illegal immigration from Mexico, more people will be able to get jobs at home and stay with their families, their incomes will rise, and they will buy more American products. Last month, Mexico replaced Japan as the second biggest purchaser of American manufacturing products. We have a $6 billion trade surplus with them. That means we create jobs out of our trade with them. So I think it is a good deal for America, and I hope we can pass it. One other quick thing. L.A. Times Mirror poll out today says 51 percent of the public thinks the press has been unfair to you, more unfair to you than your predecessors. Any comment? You know, I always trust the people in the end. They pretty well get it right. You think that is right, about right? ENTITY I think the most important thing now is what I said at my press conference last week. The American people know if there is something going on and some tension that is not-does not have much to do with their interests. And I think that is what they have perceived here. And so what I have done, clearly, in the last couple of weeks, is to reach out a hand of understanding to the capital press corps here and to ask them not to stop criticizing me, because that is their job when they think I am wrong or they think there is a story to be pursued, but to approach this whole work that we have to do together with an atmosphere of respect and greater trust. And I pledge to try to do the same thing. I think the American people want to see the flaws in my proposal, want to see the contradictions if they are there, want to see me subject to honest scrutiny. But they do not like the feeling of feeding frenzy. They do not want that. And so, you know, I have done what I could, and I hope we will have the kind of response that the American people plainly want. Chelsea going to Japan? Well, I hope so. I think it would be educational for her, although some people have said that, you know, we ought to consider what kind of Asian press coverage she will get and whether that would prohibit her from learning anything or doing anything there. But there is a lot of precedent for previous Presidents' families going on trade missions. And I'd like to see her do it. I think she'd learn a lot from it if in fact she will be able to function when she is there. So we are going to try to figure that out in the next few days. Thanks, ENTITY.

{"id": 550, "text": "I was wondering if I can sort of start broadly and lead into it. I mean, the new economy, with the increase in productivity that is tied to technology and globalism, has really led the United States to sustained economic expansion that is been amazing in the decade and growth beyond just about anyone's predictions. I was just wondering if you are a believer in this new economy scenario. And then the second part was, why, if there is such a booming economy, do you think it has not trickled all the way down to some of these distressed inner cities and the rural areas? First, I do believe in the new economy. I think that technology is rifling through every sector of economic activity, in ways that have given us dramatic increases in productivity and potential for growth without inflation that I think most models have not accurately measured. And I think that, therefore, the most important thing for Government policy is to be fiscally responsible, to create the conditions in which people can prosper, and then to try to do things which will accelerate the trends that are already underway. I think that that is what we are trying to do with Internet II, for example, and what we are trying to do with having heavy investments in biomedical research. Now, why has not it trickled down to everybody? I think there are I'd like to make three points. First of all, there has been a remarkable amount of trickling down. We have the lowest minority unemployment rate, among African-Americans and Hispanics, recorded in the nearly three decades we have been doing racially separate unemployment statistics. And many cities Detroit, for example, has an unemployment rate that is roughly half what it was in '93. On the other hand, I think there are two reasons why it has not . One is, there are enormous premiums in this new economy for education and skills, so that people who do not have an education are both more likely to remain unemployed and, even more significantly, more likely to remain underemployed or relatively undercompensated, which I think explains the lion's share of why you have had increasing inequality for over 20 years, which began to abate about the last 2 or 3 years. In the last couple of years. You have begun to see comparable and, in some cases, relatively larger income gains in the lower 40 percent. I also think the wage inequality is also reinforced by the fact that people at lower income levels are less able to buy stocks, and an enormous amount of increased wealth has come from ownership as opposed to just salaried employment. So you see a lot of the companies, for example, that offer their employees, even their lowest wage employees, stock options, something that Wal-Mart, for example, has done for a long time. Those companies will have a better record of increasing equality because their workers can afford wealth. And I think that that is important. The other thing is, of course, what you are here to talk to me about. The third point is that I think there are still disincentives to invest in the neighborhoods and communities or people which still need to be brought in. They are either real disincentives or they are imagined ones. There are, you know we have these I think there are accumulated preconceptions about where market opportunities exist and do not exist. And what I am trying to do with what I have been trying to do from the beginning of my administration with the empowerment zones and enterprise communities, with a vigorous Community Reinvestment Act over $18.5 billion was loaned under the CRA in 1997, for example; that is the last year I have numbers for with community development financial institutions, with the microenterprise lending, with all these initiatives, we have tried to remove the institutional barriers and create mechanisms which would allow capital to flow to people and to neighborhoods where they miss. We had the tax credits for hiring people off welfare or for hiring people that were in the empowerment zones or the enterprise communities. Those are things that have already had an impact. But what we are trying to do, what I am trying to do now is to deal with what I think are both of the problems that have kept some of our inner-city neighborhoods and poorest communities from fully participating. That is, we have this new markets initiative, which is basically designed to put together a package of loan guarantees and tax credits to induce new investment in these areas at more attractive rates and also the psychological barriers. We are going to take we have got Sandy Weill and Hugh McColl and Dick Huber joining Republican and Democratic elected officials, and Jesse Jackson and Al From and, you know, all these people, to shine the light on the opportunity. You know, you have got a purchasing power gap over actual sales, retail sales, that averages 25 percent in urban areas throughout the country. It is 35 percent in Los Angeles and 40 percent in East St. Louis, two places we are going. Dick Huber actually made a kind of an interesting comment, only in jest, when we went to Atlanta to kind of kick off this program. He said, You know, he said, I may be the only guy that is kind of sorry you are doing this, because we figured out there is a huge opportunity out there and now all our competitors are going to know. Well, that is one of the things that I was curious about. I mean, some of these corporations and executives Citicorp, Aetna, NationsBank have realized this. But at the same time, it seems to be uneven in the corporate community Very. where others are sitting on their corporate hands. I was wondering what you can do as President or what could be done through legislation to try to encourage more companies to go into these areas? Well, I think there are two things we can do, and I hope to do both on this tour. The first is to actually make sure that all the people in positions to make investment decisions understand that there are very gifted, very hard-working, very creative people out there in these communities and that there are enormous opportunities there, just to shine the light on what is going on and what is out there, including the infrastructure we have worked hard to put in place in the last 6 1/2 years. And secondly, I hope to build bipartisan support for passing the new markets initiative which will, in effect, make it more attractive for people to invest in these areas by giving them a tax credit of up to 25 percent and making them eligible, making certain investments eligible for loan guarantees of up to two-thirds of the amount of the total investment. I mean, if you have Government-guaranteed loans on twothirds of an investment, you get 25 percent tax credit on what you put up, that cuts the risk considerably, in ways that I think are important. So I hope to achieve that. And if I could back up, I asked the people to think about this in another way. I think there is a moral logic here, which is that we do not want to go into the 21st century, at an alltime high in prosperity, leaving so many people behind. That is not right. There is also a very compelling economic argument. You know, we have got all the debates now about what is the Fed going to do and do they need to raise interest rates and all that. I do not want to get into that. I think Mr. Greenspan and the Fed do a perfectly good job, and we have had a good partnership by recognizing each other's appropriate roles. But let me no one believes, I do not think, that we have completely repealed the laws of economics, traditional laws of economics, that we have completely repealed any tendency for inflation in our economy, or that we have completely repealed the tendency to have some business cycle. But we have dramatically improved it through this technological revolution that is going on. So if you ask yourself you put yourself in my position, and you ask yourself: Okay, you have got 4.2 percent unemployment; you have got the longest peacetime expansion in history; the country may be able to have the longest expansion in history, including wartime, in the next several months. Now, how can you keep this going? How can you keep growth going with low inflation? And that involves, is there a noninflationary way to add more workers? Is there a noninflationary way to raise wages? And the answer to that, it seems to me, is there are only basically three answers. One is, we can sell more of our goods and services around the world, which is why I strongly favor new trade initiatives and not seeing America go back to protectionism. And that is a subject for another day, but you know I am hoping we can continue to push that forward. Then, secondly, you can look at discrete populations in America which are underemployed. There are basically only two now: people on welfare we cut the welfare rolls in half, but we know that there are still people on welfare who could work, but they are harder to place and the disabled. We are about to take a huge step in that direction, with almost unanimous votes from Congress, by allowing disabled people who get Medicaid health insurance to keep their Medicaid while they go into the work force, and that will bring a lot of extra people into the work force at competitive wage rates. The third big opportunity and I am convinced the biggest one, because it is a two-fer, you get more workers and more customers is going to the neighborhoods and the communities that have basically not participated in this recovery. So it seems to me that, quite apart from our moral obligation to do this if in fact, there are business opportunities there, which are there right now, in the tens of billions of dollars, and if there are ways to make those opportunities even more attractive by the passage of this legislation that this is a major, major opportunity for our country to keep our economy going and to keep it going with low inflation. So to me, it may be finally something whose time has come. I also think we have learned something in the last 6 years about what works, and of course, there were models out there before the last 6 years. In the 1960's there was this great effort, through the Great Society programs, to build up the poor urban and rural areas. And we found that, actually, they did a lot of good, in terms of providing nutrition for people, in terms of providing health care, in terms of providing educational opportunities. But the Government alone could not build a sustaining economy. You could not build an economic infrastructure with Government alone. In the 1980's, we learned that the stock market could grow, and we could create record numbers of new millionaires and billionaires, but the private sector alone could not do this, and that more and more people would fall further and further behind. So what we have tried to do is to apply our Third Way philosophy, that we should have a partnership between Government and the private sector that would literally empower people to change the dynamics of their lives in these poor neighborhoods. That is what the whole empowerment zone, enterprise community initiative, that the Vice President has so ably run, is designed to do. That is what these CDFI's are designed to do. That is what the you know, that is why we have been so vigorous in pursuit of the Community Reinvestment Act. As I am sure you know, over 90 percent of all the loans made under the CRA, even though it is been on the books for over 20 years, have been made during the life of this administration. So this is the next logical step. The problem with all that is it is sort of uneven, and it the CRA applies nationwide where there is available capital. But the CDFI's and the empowerment zones, the enterprise communities, they only apply where they are, and there are 125 of them, but they do not cover every place. And even in the places where they exist, they do not cover all the areas of need within the cities where they exist. So if we can dramatically increase the awareness in the business community of the investment opportunities, through the use of the bully pulpit with the tour we are about to take with the business leaders and others, and if we can pass the new markets initiative, it is literally it is a nationwide initiative. It would apply everywhere where there is an economically distressed area. So I am very, very excited about this. I have been talking to Sandy Weill, and he is a big backer of new markets initiative. He was saying that if the U.S. Government can create programs that help American corporations, protect them from some of the risks around the world, that it makes sense that something similar would be offered too, more incentives in the United States. I was wondering how much of this may be modeled on some of the OPIC or other programs that have been successful around the world, and if you have had any of the same kinds of thoughts in trying to model this? Yes. We actually what we tried to do is to create at least the same, if not greater, incentives for American business to invest in America, that we give them to invest in developing economies overseas. I have been a vigorous supporter of OPIC and the Ex-Im Bank. I think that they are incredibly important to our interests and to the welfare of the people of developing countries around the world, and I would and I have strongly opposed attempts to cut back on them in the last 6 years. But I think that it is I woke up one day and basically realized we started debating what we could do that American businesses could get lower risk to invest in developing economies overseas than they could in the developing economy right here in America. And I think that is wrong. So there is a the American private investment companies that we set up, which would be eligible for the loan guarantees $2 in loan guarantee for every $1 of unguaranteed investment put up by the private sector it directly came out of our attempts to parallel the incentives for investing overseas with incentives to invest here. You have mentioned both Al From and Jesse Jackson. I am curious what you think of the efforts that Jesse Jackson has made, working with corporate America Wall Street, now in Silicon Valley to try to encourage corporate America to hire more minorities, to invest more in minority areas, and to help underwrite minority businesses. I was wondering both what your sense is of what he is done and how it may have helped shape what you are doing here? Well, I strongly support it, and I think that you know, I have spoken to his Wall Street conference in each of the last 2 years. And I think he deserves a lot of credit. He is been out there trying to get this done for a long time. And it also influenced my thinking because Dick Grasso who, you know, sponsors this with him every year and the others who help have they really persuaded me that there was a lot more we could do, even within existing law. And I am hoping that I can support his efforts, that there will be that these things will be entirely complementary. You know, maybe this is just the moment at which years and years of accumulated effort by a lot of people will be bearing fruit. I have been interested in this whole issue, and Hillary has, for a long, long time, every since we first learned about the efforts of the South Shore Development Bank in Chicago, and we brought a development bank like that to Arkansas, with a microenterprise loan program. And I realized that AID was helping people like Muhammad Yunus, who is founded the Grameen Bank at Bangladesh, you know, to do this kind of thing around the world. And I thought we ought to be doing it at home. And we had some good success in Arkansas. And in the mid-eighties, I headed, along with the Governors of Louisiana and Mississippi, the Delta Development Commission the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission. And we looked at how to do these kinds of things in the Mississippi Delta, which is the poorest part of America. And so, as I said, there are lots of people have been out there working on this, trying to get this done for a long time. And it seems to me that we now have enough evidence that what we have done works but that we still have these two big barriers. One is, the business community is not fully aware of what opportunities they actually have to make money now, and the second is that there are, frankly, still some greater risks in these areas that we ought to try to overcome by putting in place a framework where there is much more incentive to invest and at least as much as we give to invest overseas. You have mentioned your upcoming trip that leaves July 5th and will go everywhere from Appalachia to Los Angeles. I was wondering if there are any kind of specific proposals that you see there, that will bring improvement to the communities you are going to visit? If you are I know that the idea is to leave rays of hope in each of the places, but I did not know if there were any specifics that you are looking to leave. We are going to do we will try to do three things. One, we will try to highlight initiatives that are working now, things that we like, we will have places that have benefited from the community development financial institutions, for example. Two, we will try to highlight how the impact of the new markets initiative, if the Congress were to pass it, would take these benefits and immeasurably increase them and do it on a national basis, wherever there is need. And the third thing we will do is to have a whole series of announcements by business leaders about things they are going to do on their own, because they would be profitable, and by the way, they will create businesses; they will create jobs; they will create opportunities in these areas. So we will have a heavy emphasis on that third area, because I do not think that, as I said, for a minute that this is primarily a Government initiative. This is a partnership initiative. But there are lots of opportunities right now, here, that people are genuinely unaware of. And I think most Americans understand how much prosperity we have and that no one could have imagined that the stock market would more than triple and that we would have now almost 19 million new jobs in the last 6 1/2 years and that all these things would happen and yet there would still be these pockets left behind. So I think there is a longing to see all of our fellow citizens caught up in this prosperity, everyone who is willing to work. And I think that, you know, when people actually know the facts, that there is a lot of money to be made out there just on the retail if you think about the retail issue alone, the fact that there is a purchasing power gap of 25 percent in these urban inner cities, that is a stunning statistic; and it is a bigger market than virtually all of our foreign markets; and that is just on retail; never mind the factories you could put in; never mind the other kinds of nonretail, small business services you could have. It is amazing. What is the status of the legislation? Republicans on the Hill say that they are still waiting for precise wording. It is pretty well known in general what will be in it. I was wondering if you have both timetable and game plan for going ahead and trying to get something done. Well, what I want to do, I wanted to do this tour first, and get I know there will be a lot of Republican legislators, I believe, will participate in this because this really is something that Republicans should like. It is a completely it is free enterprise. It is using the tax system to prove that the enterprise system can work in every community in America, which is what they believe. And so what I am hoping will happen and what I intend to do is, during the tour and then immediately after, I want to consult with the leaders of Congress in both parties, see if there is the kind of bipartisan support for this concept that I think there should be, and then we will quickly move to get the legislation up there, because we have got it all budgeted, and it is well within the budget. And it also would be well within the budget potential of many Republican initiatives. I mean, the interesting thing is, if you do loan guarantees and tax credits, they do not cost that much money for the enormous benefit that they bring. Mr. Durham. I guess most of the Republican the Republican approach where it differs is zero capital gains, they are talking about, or some further regulatory relief. That is sort of separate from these kinds of incentives, and I do not know if there is any room for that in the final package or But that would not do anything. You know, we had a capital gains reduction in the Balanced Budget Act. But that would not do anything to specifically increase the likelihood of money going here. Because what we propose to do is to increase the relative attractiveness of these investments, recognizing that the relative risk is still slightly greater for a lot of the things that we'd like to see done. So I think that those conversations ought to occur in the context of our larger budget negotiations. But on this, I think that we still should do this. Whatever we come up with, in the end, with a tax bill, this should be done on its own merits. We need to increase the relative attractiveness during this period, just like we are increasing the relative ability to hire people who are disabled because they can carry their Medicaid health insurance with them into the work force. Do you you were talking about growth, and perhaps the new economy and the changes of the recent decade would change the models of growth. Do you see, down the road, where you could have growth more than 2 percent, where it could be 3.5 percent or more per year? Without inflation? Without inflation. Oh sure, well, that is what we have had for the last 6 years. Yes, exactly. I do. But I think if we are going to do it, you have to find ways to find new customers and add to the work force in areas where there is an opportunity for growth without inflation. For example, I think suppose we did all this, and we got down to a 3.5 percent unemployment rate. It is not inconceivable to me that we could do that, if we target these population groups and these neighborhoods and these places, without a substantial increase in inflation. Then the next big step is, I still believe, is that we and the other wealthy countries of the world are going to have to really work in a disciplined fashion with well-run nations, developing nations, and maximize the use of technology. I think a lot of these poor countries, if they are well-run, could skip a whole generation of economic development because of technology. With the advent of the Internet, I think you could first of all, you could revolutionize all their schools. When I was in Africa, in these little villages in Uganda, which is the country in Africa that is done the most to cut its AIDS rate so it has it is a country with capacity and a sophisticated government, and I went into the little villages that had outdated maps that still had the Soviet Union there and all that. And I thought to myself, if we wired all these schools, if we hooked them up to the Internet, they could also have printers, and they would not have to buy new maps; they could print out new maps. And the government could cover the operating costs of the computers in the schools. They could just be printing you know, you just hook them up with a printer. They could print their educational materials. They could print their maps. There are things we could do, and I believe let me just say one other thing. I also think these countries can skip a generation of development in the sense that they do not have to, even in their initial stages, worsen their environment the way people did through the industrial revolution if they do it in a clever way. So I think the opportunities for new jobs, new growth without inflation, because of technology and because of what we know in these areas, are stunning. But in order to do it over the long run, over a sustained basis for 10 years, let us say we are going to have to have much more sophisticated trading links, which means that we are going to have to deal with the things I talked about in Geneva both times, in my two trade talks there and the things I talked about at the University of Chicago. We have got to somehow build a consensus on trade that makes the American working people feel that we are preserving the social contract, if you will, here at home, and that we are doing it in a way that advances the lives of ordinary people around the world. I think, if we can do that, if we can sort of adapt the world trading system on the theory of leaving no one behind and making maximum use of new technologies and what we know about economic potential I think that this thing can go on for an indefinite period. But if we do not , if we do not do that, if we do not deal with the populations and the neighborhoods here at home, if we do not do these things, then at some point, you will reach a floor in unemployment, and wage demands will occur and there will be some shortage or another around the world in some thing or another people need, and inflation will resume. Right. But I do think that the world is in a different place now. I think we whatever happens, about things we do not know about you know, no economist has an accurate model of how this has all changed the business cycle or what productivity has really done to growth. But what we know is that if we are fiscally responsible and we continue to pursue this course that you and I discussed here today, that we will perform far better than we otherwise would, that we will be better citizens in terms of our relationships with one another in America, and we will be better citizens of the world. We know that, regardless, we will get better performance and we will be a better society. So I hope that we can keep pushing all of this. I would not be a good BusinessWeek reporter if I did not ask about the trillion-dollar windfall, as it were, and if you see this as on opening to a possible agreement that would cover everything from Medicare, with the prescription drug benefit that you talked about today to, on the Republican side, perhaps tax cuts that would be larger than what you had spelled out in the State of the Union? I think it obviously, when you have more money than you thought you were going to, it should make it easier to have an omnibus agreement. And I hope it will. From my point of view, I want to caution, however, that all of this, what we have this year, we will actually have, everything else we are projecting that what will make the projections turn out to be facts is very disciplined, responsible management of the economy and the clear signal to the markets that we are managing our long-term problems. So this should make it easier to make an agreement on Social Security and Medicare and paying down the debt and still have more funds for education, medical research, tax cuts, you name it. But we have to have our priorities in order. We still do not want to go off and have a big tax cut and ignore the Medicare liabilities, the Social Security liabilities, or what I consider to be the enormous opportunity we have to pay off the debt of the country over the next 15 years. When I became President, we had a $290 billion deficit, and it was projected to increase forever. And now we project that next year we will have a $142 billion surplus, and we could actually be out of debt in 15 years. Now, I think it is important to note why that is. Again, in a global economy with global financial markets, I think that is quite a desirable thing, because it means lower interest rates for everything from business investment to car payments to home mortgages to college loans to credit cards. It means, therefore, more money for jobs, for growth, for wages; and it means we are relatively less dependent on global markets in times of turmoil, like we had in Asia. It also means that our trading partners again, we want them to grow; they need to do well, these developing countries it means they will be able to access capital, that they will have to get from beyond their borders, at lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case, because we will not be the Government, at least will not be in these markets. So I think the idea of the United States and, hopefully, other wealthy countries in the world being free of public debt, at least long-term, structural public debt you know, maybe if a country wants to undertake to rebuild all its airports and float bonds to do it, that is one thing. But you know what I mean; I mean longterm, structural public debt I think is a very appealing prospect for the world over the next 15 to 20 years, because then we could take a lot of this investment capital that would normally go to governments in the United States and put it into these developing economies, where it is desperately needed, in a way that would benefit them and benefit us. So I hope that again, this should have appeal to the Republicans as well as the Democrats, the idea of making America debt-free. Right. And we can have a tax cut. But we ought to do Social Security and Medicare, and I still believe a big portion of these taxes ought to be tax cuts ought to be directed toward helping more people save for their retirement. That is another thing. You know, most people will not have enough in their private pensions and Social Security and in their present 401 accounts to sustain their lifestyles when they retire. So I do think that my proposal there deserves some consideration from the Republican majority, just because I think it is good social policy, and it is a good way to give a tax cut to increase savings. We have got our savings rate in America has gone up in the last 6 years solely because of the decline in Government deficits, and now the surplus. There has been no increase in savings by individuals. Now, that is somewhat misleading, because it does not count record-high homeownership. But still, I think, I hope we can get all this done. The new economic news should increase the chances of an omnibus agreement. But we still have to keep first things first here. Federal Reserve Board Chairman My Sam Donaldson question is, what about Alan Greenspan? ENTITY. Well, you know, he is established a pretty good record, and he is been right a lot more often than he is been wrong over the last several years. And as I said, the relationship we have had has been one of mutual respect and independence, and I respect his he knows what we are doing. He knows that we are determined to be fiscally responsible, and he knows actually, we have not talked about some of the things that are in this article, but I am sure he will read it, and he will get a feel for what my theory is for how we can achieve long-term growth without inflation. But he also knows there are these underlying things that he monitors every week for the Fed, and he will make the best judgment he can. And whatever he does is his decision to make. Do you think he might for 5 more years? Oh, I do not even know if he wants to do it. I have not talked to him. I do not even know if he is interested. Well, thank you very much. ENTITY.

{"id": 117, "text": "Thank you for coming, ENTITY. It is great to be here, Pioln. Pioln, that was an unbelievable introduction. Thank you so much. Thank you for making the time to be with us. Well, you remember the last time I was in the studio, I promised that.... ...I would come back as ENTITY and so even though it took a few years, I am keeping my promise. Thank you, ENTITY. Well, it is great to be back. I thank you for that. Thank you. I know you are a man that keeps the promise and you make it happen, so we are gonna start, ENTITY. I am gonna give you the option, you know, which topic would you like me to begin with. We can talk about anything you want, Pioln. I am gonna give you options. Multiple choice. Are you ready? I am. A.) Immigration reform B.) Immigration reform, C.) Immigration reform or D.) All of the above. I think I will take D.) All of the above. Absolutely. Many Hispanics feel disappointed with you because comprehensive immigration reform has not been passed. What can you tell them? Well, I am disappointed, too. As you heard in the introduction, this is something that I have been committed to for many years. I committed to it when I was a U.S. Senator, I committed to it when I was a state senator. It is something that I deeply believe that we have got to solve our immigration problem so that we are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws so that people can come out of the shadows, that people who are productive and otherwise law-abiding are able to get on a pathway to citizenship. They pay a fine, pay back taxes, learn English, become part of this beautiful American community of ours. And the fact that we have not got it done is something that frustrates me and I know that it frustrates many people in the community. But I think it is important for people to understand why it has not gotten done. In the United States Senate, over the last two years, many Republicans who used to support Comprehensive Immigration Reform, like John McCain, decided not to support it and in the Senate, you have got a rule that says 50 votes is not enough. That you cannot just pass a law with 50 or 51 votes, you have to have a super majority of 60 votes. We have the majority of Democrats supporting us, so I could easily get 50 votes, Democratic votes, but I'd need some help from our Republican friends. And what happened was we still have 11 Republicans in the United States Senate who voted for Comprehensive Immigration Reform four years ago, but now are not willing to step up. And so the problem that we have is, is that until I can get some cooperation from the other side, then people who are anti-immigration reform can continue to block it. And that is why this election coming up is so important because we essentially have to say that those who are politicizing the issue, who are supportive of the Arizona law, who talk only about border security but are not willing to talk about the other aspects of this, who do not support the Dream Act, who are out there engaging in rhetoric that is divisive and damaging that -- those are not the kinds of folks who represent our core American values. But ENTITY, you were able to pass a healthcare plan and you worked a lot for that. And most of my listeners, they have not seen that, the same way that you worked for healthcare for immigration reform. The same effort. Well, here is the difference, Pioln. First of all, on immigration reform, I cannot get 100 percent of Democrats. I can get 90 percent of Democrats, but I cannot get 100 percent. So with healthcare reform, we were just, like, a vote short, just one vote, and so if we have worked so hard, we could finally tip it over the edge. Right now on immigration reform, we are eight votes short or 10 votes short, so we have do the work behind the scenes to build the groundswell of support that can get us then over the finish line. What I do not wanna do is start this thing like we did several years ago and then it just collapses because if you start it and you do not finish it, then people say, well, this cannot be done and four years from now, five years from now, we will still be talking about immigration reform. What we are trying to do is to build a consensus in the country that says, this is the right thing to do, that we have got some bipartisan support. I have met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus many times, I have met with immigration rights groups many times. I have not backed off of this issue. Just a few months ago, I gave a speech outlining very clearly my support for comprehensive immigration reform. My cabinet has been working very hard on trying to get it done, but ultimately, I think somebody said the other day, I am ENTITY, I am not king. I cannot do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I am committed to making it happen, but I have gotta have some partners to do it. Yes. And that is why last year, I put together a group of well-respected leaders to help you, but I never heard back from your office. Ah, but Pioln, look, the truth of the matter is -- here is the question that I think all your listeners have to ask themselves. If the vast majority of Democrats support this issue, if ENTITY support this issue, if we have been willing to speak out on this issue forcefully and we have the other party, which not only is not supporting it, but actually doing things that are damaging to the Latino community, then the question I have is why are we spending time talking about us instead of spending time focusing on getting Republicans to do what is right? Because I am not asking for 100 percent support from Republicans, I am not asking even for 50 percent support from Republicans. I just want a little bit of support so that I can actually get this thing passed. Now, the fact of the matter is, is that we have worked this issue hard; we will continue to work this hard. I am only in the first two years of my presidency and, by the way, I had a huge economic crisis. The issues like healthcare reform that we worked on are hugely important to the Latino community. By far, Hispanics are the most likely to work and not have health insurance. The issues of the economy hugely affect the Hispanic community. A lot of them were in construction and when the housing market collapsed, that meant a lot of people were laid off. So it is not as if the issues that we are working on are issues that are not important to the Latino community. They are very important. Immigration reform is one of those issues we are gonna get it done, but I am gonna continue to need some help from the other side. When is it going to happen? You will tell me after this. Well, here is what we are gonna do. We are gonna see how well we do in this election and I think a lot of it is gonna depend on whether we still have some support not only from Democrats, but also Republicans, but they are gonna be paying attention to this election. And if Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, we are gonna punish our enemies and we are gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us, if they do not see that kind of upsurge in voting in this election, then I think it is gonna be harder and that is why I think it is so important that people focus on voting on November 2. But how can you ask for their vote now... if, like... most of my listeners, that is what they see ... that you have not worked that hard to make comprehensive immigration reform now. Pioln, I completely disagree with you on this. With all due respect, even though I am in your studio. The notion that we have not worked it hard is just not true. There is a notion that somehow if I had worked it hard enough, we could have magically done it. That is just not the way our system works. If I need 60 votes to get this done, then I am gonna have to have some support from the other side. If the Latino community decides to sit out this election, then there will be fewer votes and it will be less likely to get done. And the other side, which is fighting against this, is not gonna support it, so look, let me say this as an African American. We worked for decades on civil rights. Civil rights did not come after one year. It did not come after two years. People had to march, they had to have their heads beaten, they had fire hoses put on them. Even after Dr. King gave his I Have a Dream Speech, it still took years before African Americans achieved full citizenship in this country. Change is not easy. It does not happen overnight. Now, you know, for us to say, oh, it did not happen right away and so we are just giving up and we are not gonna be involved in the system, that makes no sense. That is not the history of this country. That is not the history of change in our own lives. All of us, you included Pioln, have gone through hardships, you have had your struggles and what happens is, is that you keep on working and you keep on working and you keep on working and finally, eventually you make a breakthrough and you get things done. That is how change happens for us personally, that is how change happens in the country, so instead of us giving up, we just have to keep working until it gets done. Well, yeah, we are gonna keep working. Absolutely. But I would like to find out the steps that we need to take, ENTITY, so we can help you to make this happen. Look, the steps are very clear. Pressure has to be put on the Republican Party. How? Well, let me give you a very specific example. Right now, Nevada, you have got a majority leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, who is running against a woman named Sharron Angle who is completely opposed to comprehensive immigration reform. Now, you have got a Republican Latino ad that is being run saying to Latinos, do not vote. It is a cynical attempt to discourage Latinos from voting so that Harry Reid, who supports comprehensive immigration reform, would lose because the Latino vote does not come out. The woman who is running against him, who opposes comprehensive immigration reform, would win and we would be in much worse shape. It would -- we'd be farther away from achieving it, so a very specific example is making sure that you support the person who supports comprehensive immigration reform and Latinos in Nevada turn up. And that is true all across the country. I mean, the -- there is no place in the country where the Latino vote does not matter and even if Latinos are gonna support Republicans, they should say to the Republican candidate, the price of our support is you publicly saying that you are gonna support comprehensive immigration reform because I have already said that, Harry Reid has already said that, Democrats are already on record as saying it. If I can get the votes, I'd sign the bill tomorrow. So you have to put the same pressure on those who have not yet been willing to publicly commit to comprehensive immigration reform and if they do not publicly commit, then you have gotta vote against them. Believe me, we will. Good. Under your administration, ENTITY, almost half a million immigrants have been deported, more than any other ENTITY. I want to be clear that I am talking about immigrant families that are hard working, are learning the English language and are helping our economy. What can your administration do to stop deportations now? Well, the main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws. What my administration has done is actually change our priorities because you mentioned that there are a lot of families out there, but the truth is, it is actually that the way we are now enforcing the law puts less emphasis on families, more emphasis on those with criminal records and so the big increase in deportations has actually to do with people with criminal records who've been engaging in illegal activity, not just because they do not have papers, but because they have been engaging in criminal activity. But the most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works -- again, I just wanna repeat, I am ENTITY, I am not king. If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves. But there is a limit to the discretion that I can show because I am obliged to execute the law. That is what the Executive Branch means. I cannot just make the laws up by myself. So the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws. That requires Congress to cooperate. As I have said before, I have got the majority of Democrats who are ready to make those changes, but we are gonna need some help from the other side and that is where our focus has to be. ENTITY, would you try to approve the Dream Act in Congress after the election and before next year? You know, I am a big supporter of the Dream Act. I have spoken about it many times. I used to be a sponsor of the bill when I was in the Senate. What I wanna do is I wanna consult with immigrant rights groups and with the Congressional Hispanic Caucuses to make a strategic decision. It may be that we can pass the Dream Act without comprehensive immigration reform. The only thing I am concerned about is if we just take that small piece, then maybe it becomes harder for us to get the whole thing and so I would love to see the Dream Act passed right away, but I think it is very important for us to have a discussion within the community. If we think realistically that is the only thing that we could get done, then we may make that judgment, but I am still holding out right now to see if we can get the Dream Act passed and AgJobs passed as part of a broader package so that we allow the 10 to 12 million people who are still living in the shadows to come out and not live in fear. Look, obviously, the Dream Act would be better than nothing and that is something that I think we are gonna have to judge. But I do not wanna make that decision by myself. I wanna be in a discussion with the community and we are not gonna know until after this election. So, so much depends on what do things look like after the election. So you will give me a call? You know, I will be happy to give you a call, Pioln, the -- I am not sure that -- I am not sure that we are gonna know the day after the election, but I think that we are gonna be able to have a better sense of how many votes we have got for comprehensive immigration reform, how many votes do we have for the Dream Act. You know, sitting down with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I think we will have a strategy and we will certainly let your listeners know. What can you tell the 50 million people that do not have a job right now, ENTITY? It is gonna take time for us to rebuild this economy after taking such a bad blow. Keep in mind what happened. We went through the worst crisis since the Great Depression, since the 1930s and so what happened was that the housing market collapsed, businesses shrank, banks were not lending and we lost four million jobs before I was even sworn in. We lost almost another four million jobs in the first three months that I was sworn in. We lost eight million jobs before any of my economic plans had a chance to take effect. Now, we have worked very hard over the last two years to help to rebuild and stabilize the housing market, to put people back to work building roads and bridges and our infrastructure, saving jobs of teachers who were threatened to be laid off and now we have an economy that is growing again and we have seen in the private sector job growth for the last nine months. All that is important, but we have a long way to go and the key now is to help small business get loans so that they can keep their doors open and hire more workers and that is especially important in the Latino community because Latino community's an entrepreneurial community. People like to start a business and they have gotta get financing and we have been putting a lot of emphasis on that. We have gotta make sure that we keep on building our infrastructure. A lot of Latino workers who are in construction, they could also be working to help to build new airport runways, new school construction, so getting projects going that can put people back to work right away, that is something that we have proposed. But it is gonna take a few more years. When you fall into such a deep hole, it takes time for you to climb back out. That is what we are doing right now. I feel confident that we are moving in the right direction. The one thing that we cannot do is go back to the same policies that the Republicans had in place that resulted in this disaster in the first place. I agree, ENTITY. We understand that, you know, you have been working a lot and you can count on us, you know, to help you so we can become, you know, united and together move forward in this beautiful country. And that is why we have a gift for you. Oh, this is beautiful. The -- for those of you who are just listening, this is a -- just a beautiful picture. Pioln read what it says on there. I have gotta take a look at it. I want you to read it, ENTITY. Okay. It says... It is a drawing. It is a beautiful drawing with beautiful kids and a dove at the top and it quotes a passage of scripture from Joshua. It says, Have I not commanded you be strong and courageous, do not be terrified, do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. I will treasure this always. This is just a beautiful gift and this will have a beautiful place in the White House for me to put this up. I know, ENTITY, that it has not been easy for you. You know, let me say this, Pioln. You know, 'cause a lot of people say this to me, they say, oh, you know, you have a really hard job. You know, you have all these problems, everybody expects you to solve them right away, people are criticizing you and I say, you know what? The problems that I have are not nothing compared to the problems that people have every day if their losing their job, they may lose their mortgage, they are trying to figure out how to finance their kids' college education. This is a great privilege for me to be ENTITY and to be able to help people as much as I can and I get frustrated that we are not moving as quickly as I'd like. I am not getting as much cooperation sometimes as I want in Congress, but I feel confident that we are making progress. I will just give you one example. You know, we were able, because of the work that we did, to change how we finance the Student Loan Program to take tens of billions of dollars that used to go to the banks that are now going to Pell Grants and student loans. Millions of children, a lot of young Latino students, are now getting scholarships and grants that did not get it before and are able to aspire to college. When you get something like that done, you feel good in the morning when you wake up because you know, okay, I still have a long check list of things I have to do, but at least we are making a difference right now. I am gonna tell you, ENTITY, that we are inviting my listeners to vote in this election. We are gonna make a difference again because we did it on the last election. Absolutely. You know that? Listen, the -- you did a great job and this is such a popular show and I think people are so inspired by your story, I am inspired by your story, so I just want everybody who is listening to remember that just as you were able to rise up and become incredible success, just as I, somebody from modest means, was able to become ENTITY, everyone of your listeners can succeed. You have got a ENTITY who cares about your success and we are gonna keep on working hard to make sure that everybody is able to live out the American dream. Thank you, ENTITY. It is great to be here. Thank you, thank you, thank you, ENTITY. Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you once again. It is great to see you. And it is great to see you, too. And thank you for keeping the promise that you told us. Just as I kept my promise on this, I am gonna keep my promise on immigration reform. Thank you, guys. Member of Audience: Thank you, thank you. With God, anything's possible.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the G-8 is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in the Czech Republic. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. That is my third trip? Second trip? Second trip. It is a beautiful city. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. Vaclav Havel has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that the United States must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to Germany for the G-8. I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And then the G-8, it is going to be an important meeting, just like all G-8s are. And this year I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to Poland. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in Czech Republic, third time in Poland. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend Vladimir Putin is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. Russia is not hostile; Russia is a friend. We do not agree with Russia all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with Vladimir Putin not only at the G- 8 but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of the Czech Republic, Poland, Italy, and, to a certain extent, Bulgaria, and definitely Germany, there is a lot of obviously, you know, Americans who are very interested in this trip. Polish Americans are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their American President in Poland-or in Italy, a lot of Italian Americans are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be Afghanistan or Iraq, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to two things in Italy, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. It is a moving experience. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, three visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. He is a good thinker and a smart man. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister Prodi, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the EU. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in Georgia, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in Afghanistan, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in Afghanistan. And then, of course, Bulgaria-I am looking forward to that as well. I have never been; it is the first time. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. Bulgaria has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. We are proud to be allies. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the U.S. President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to Germany or Italy, probably Poland and the Czech Republic, but not necessarily Bulgaria and Albania. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech today. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the American people, to the G- 8 and hoping to encourage others to match it. ENTITY. You can call me ENTITY. Call me W. You just said that Vladimir Putin is your friend. Yes, he is. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing Czech Republic and Poland as possible sites for the missile defense? No. The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our NATO allies. Secondly, friends can disagree. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is not. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary Gates to see the leadership, the Russian leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the Russians to participate, totally transparent-- They are not happy-- Let me finish, Ted. We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. They are welcome to come. Angela Merkel was very instrumental in us reaching out to the Russians; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. And so we are working very carefully, but we think it is the right thing to do. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. Bob Gates said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. But the cold war is over. We are now into the 21st century, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President Putin about. Thank you, ENTITY. But certainly it is fair to say the relationship between the West and Russia has become more complicated-- Yes, it has. --in recent months. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. Is Russia-a re-assertive Russia, a friend, an ally, or a challenge? For the U.S.-I cannot speak for the EU-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the U.S.-Russian relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. Vladimir Putin will tell me that Russia is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in Estonia, for example-in relation to the actions taken in Estonia were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with Kosovo. We believe we ought to advance the Ahtisaari agreement through the United Nations Security Council. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with Russia on matters like Iran. We have worked closely with Russia in the U.N. Security Council to send a clear signal to the Iranians that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between the United States and Russia. It is in the world's interest that the United States and Russia and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with Russia on North Korea. As you know, we spoke with one voice to the leadership in North Korea, that Russia and China and the United States and South Korea and Japan strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with Russia is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that Angela Merkel has also had to deal with Vladimir Putin and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the German people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to Russia to gain acceptance, Russia's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to Poland, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in Poland, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from Russia very carefully? First of all, Poland and the U.S. are in NATO, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of the United States and NATO and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that Poland will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in Poland could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in NATO, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do NATO allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where Poland had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view Poland as being under any military threat. I would hope the Polish people do not , either. Obviously, there are differences you have with Russia over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an EU matter; it is a matter that Angela Merkel is working hard, as the head of the EU at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate Poland for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And there is jobs as a result of our airplane deal; there is capital investment; there is more transparency in our relationship. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. Yes, ENTITY ENTITY. How are you? Very good. Thank you for having us back here. Yes. Your first meeting with Benedict XVI: What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? And besides this, on foreign policy: What common ground you may have with the Catholic Church on issues like Cuba or China or Lebanon? Yes. Thank you. The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in the Rose Garden yesterday, I talked about spending $30 billion on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a $15 billion initiative over 5 years, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for about 1,100,000 people in a 3-year period, up from 50,000. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from Catholic charities or Catholic congregations here in the United States. And I will tell him how proud I am of our Catholic citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to about 30 million people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I hope to get him talking. He is a sound thinker. I have read one of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. And I go in openminded, and I am willing to listen. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about Cuba, I'd love to talk about Cuba. I believe Cuba ought to be free. And I believe that when there is a transition to new leadership, the world ought to work for freedom, not stability; that the leading edge of our agenda ought to be to say to whomever takes over that Government: We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned Lebanon; I will confirm our strong support for the Siniora Government. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that one of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the Hariri trial for the U.N. was to enhance the Siniora Government. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. The other issue is China. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in China and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. It was not , like, fake; it was real. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for the Catholic Church inside of China. One of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between the Chinese Government and the Catholic Church so that eventually the prescribed leadership, Catholic leadership, would be able to have an active role in China. So far, the Chinese Government has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our Catholic cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the Chinese. And I have. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know Bulgaria is one of the newest members of NATO. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of NATO, including Bulgaria. And there are American military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. That is where the debate is. And you are right; that will not cover all of NATO. As I said in my opening comments: It will cover most of NATO. Bulgaria will be covered by NATO missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our NATO-when I am in Bulgaria, it is important for our NATO allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. But we have got to make sure, if they ever are needed, that they are effective. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about Iran having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, one way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect Bulgaria; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, NATO technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. I forgot. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, there is a little bit of criticism out there, evidently. Yes, Ted, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the American people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect America is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. And we do not do that alone: we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- Do not you-- Let me finish, Ted. I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in Afghanistan and Iraq; I made the right decisions. And now the fundamental question is, will the world help these young democracies develop? And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. And I am looking forward to thanking our host countries when I travel for their commitments: In some cases, Iraq and Afghanistan, in some cases, only Afghanistan; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. And so no, I believe the decisions I made were the right decisions. You do not feel abandoned? What? Abandoned. You do not feel abandoned? No, no, not at all. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? Quite the contrary. I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in Iraq that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in Afghanistan, all the NATO countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. No, quite the contrary. I feel these alliances are significant. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. And the stakes in the world-but, no. Thank you for asking. My roommate in college was Rob Dieter. He was from Florida, though. You are ENTITY Okay. ENTITY, in the run-up to the G-8 meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the German press. The President. Really? You mean you want it to be divisive. No, not at all. Are you going to go in openminded? Yes, I am always openminded. That is good. Is that the case-- Always. Let us say, assuming it was true-you were--this morning. Does it help to bridge the gap between the U.S. position and the European position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? And is there any prospect for a firm consensus at Heiligendamm? Or have you basically preempted Heiligendamm? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the German press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. And the initiative I laid out today said: We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. In other words, there needs to be a post-Kyoto framework. And I suggested, here is one way to deal with the post-Kyoto world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a post-Kyoto framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And so today I said I believe there ought to be a post-Kyoto framework. And I believe Angela will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. Secondly, I believe there ought to be an international goal. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like India or China, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including Russia and China and India and the United States and the EU and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. In other words, there is a commitment in our country. Now, I said this in the Rose Garden, next to the Chancellor and Jose Barroso, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the U.S. to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. And that is my pledge. I am looking forward to it. And I also bring a very good record, because the truth of the matter is, technology is going to enable us to meet two objectives-or three objectives, in the U.S. case: One, energy independent; two, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with the United States, you would want us to be economically strong. You do not want your trading partner to be weak; there would be nothing to trade with. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to about, I think, 6 billion gallons of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over the next years, 50 percent of every automobile in the United States will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. There is significant market penetration for ethanol in the Midwest. But we are spending billions of dollars-or millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in Germany. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. And so we are addressing greenhouse gases and tailpipe emissions to the point where I said to the United States: We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by 20 percent over 10 years. It is a remarkable initiative. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the Japanese are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing America is, how fast can we develop zero-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in the G-8. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. They ought to be investing. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, ENTITY I am open. There you go. You are my man. And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with Russia, Japan, France, Great Britain on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. It is an important subject: just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Yes. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, last year in Estonia and Latvia, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. Now many months-- I promised I would work on it. Many months went by. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Okay. . Yes, let me talk about it. It affects the Czech Republic, it affects Poland, and it affects Bulgaria. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with the United States. And they look at neighbors in the EU or NATO and say, wait a minute; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the German citizen be given a type of visa and not the Polish citizen. And we are working closely with Congress to change long-standing law. And I said I would. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our Congress to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. And we are. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with Congress. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in the United States. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from Congress, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. Prodi's energy on Afghanistan. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? Of course. I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the Italian commitment is to Afghanistan and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like Italy to do in Afghanistan and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see Italy as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in Rome. They are very angry. Oh, yes. I am going to meet some protesters in Rome again? They declared a No Bush Day. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. It is what happens when you travel. I presume there is going to be a few in Germany, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. That is actually a healthy thing. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in Genoa, if you remember. Who does not remember? . Yes. Anyway, that is what happens when world leaders get together. Now the other-- And the other question was about Afghanistan, Italy's role in Afghanistan. Yes, it is a very important role. First of all, commitment to Afghanistan, itself, helps. Basically it says to the Afghan people: We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. Secondly, Italy is making significant contribution: police training, judicial training. It is an important commitment. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in Italy, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. We work a lot trying to find out where. This enemy is dangerous. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. The temptation is to say, well, maybe they are not that dangerous anymore. I am telling you, they are dangerous, and they need the full commitment of free nations: the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they are moving. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. Italy has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to Russia-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that Russia is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on Russia and the Kremlin in this field of energy security? And if you allow, a second, more personal question. Yes, go ahead. Just 18 months from now your second term expires. And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in the next, say, 10 to 25 years from now? Thanks. I do have, I do not know, 19 months? Eighteen. Who is counting? I am going to sprint. First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. There is a lot to do, a lot of big issues. A lot to do here at home too: keep taxes low. I am a tax cutter. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the American people. I believe we are going to get a lot done too. My concern for America is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. It is easy to say: Well, the competition is too tough; let us just not trade. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for America. I would hope that 15 years from now America still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my Japanese friend Prime Minister Koizumi, now Prime Minister Abe, Shinzo Abe, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the U.S. President sits at the table with the Japanese Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Same thing can happen if the United States stays engaged and helps societies become free societies. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in Germany, in many ways. We are allies; Angela Merkel and I are very close. I would hope the United States would never lose sight of that capacity. And the other question? About Russia, political-- Oh, the energy, yes. Here is the thing: You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. And, therefore, our strategy is to diversify. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in the United States. We have got about 250 years of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent about $2 billion on your FutureGen plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has zero emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over the next 10 to 20 years, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at the beginning of the 21st century moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. I do not know if you know this: We are spending over a billion dollars on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in America, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech today, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, over $12 billion over the years that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. And it is also healthy that there be competition. I like the idea that the Japanese are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. Competition is healthy. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And so I am an optimistic guy. I think when you look back 10 or 20 years from now, you will be amazed at what happens. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got 18 more months to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be an exciting 18 months. Anyway, thank you for your time. Looking forward to seeing you over there. Yes, enjoyed it.

{"id": 257, "text": "ENTITY, first of all, thank you very, very much for talking with us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. Senator Trent Lott called your proposed gun control legislation the typical knee-jerk reaction, and Congressman Tom DeLay accused you of exploiting the issue for political benefit. You would say to them? That is ridiculous, and down deep they know it. I think you know, what I tried to say the other day is that we have a culture with too much violence in it for our children, and we need to address that, television, the Internet, the whole range of things. But we also have a culture in America full of good people who are devoted to hunting and sport shooting, whose political views on these issues, I think, have been manipulated to create a movement that has terrified a lot of Members of Congress from taking the most elemental precautions to keep criminals and keep children from having guns that they should not have, that any other society in the world would take. Good people And that is why we have well, what I mean is, most of the people that are involved in serious hunting and sport shooting, they are law-abiding; they pay their taxes; they do what they are asked to do for the country; they are fine people. But they have been convinced that the most modest, sensible ways of keeping society safer are some kind of camel's nose in a tent that will end up in the loss of their rifles, and that is ridiculous. You know, the Brady bill has kept over a quarter of a million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting guns. Who knows how many people it saved. But we have got loopholes in the Brady bill. We have got loopholes in the assault weapons ban. We have got loopholes in the restrictions on these bit ammunition clips. We do not apply background checks at gun shows, which we ought to. We do not apply background checks to the purchase of explosives, which we ought to. These are sensible measures that will keep people alive. Who are these people being manipulated by? The National Rifle Association? The National Rifle Association and some of these other groups as well. The NRA, by the way, ENTITY, is getting ready to meet in Denver. If you could have a cup of coffee with Charlton Heston before that meeting gets underway, what would you say to him? I would say it is , You ought to be Moses and lead your people out of Egypt into the Promised Land. You ought to think about how we can protect the rights of hunters and use the good things the NRA's done to educate children, young people, on gun safety, for example. And stop wasting your energy when we try to say that a juvenile that commits a violent crime should not have a gun; stop wasting your energy when we try to reinstitute the waiting period for the Brady bill or close the assault weapons loopholes or close the loopholes in the Brady bill or say that we ought to have a background check for explosives or a background check at these gun shows. That is what we ought to do. This is designed to keep people alive, for goodness sakes. This has nothing to do with the right to hunt or to engage in sporting contests. ENTITY, do you believe any elements of your gun control package might have prevented the tragedy in Littleton? Well, we have to have all the facts. We know that they were involved with explosives. We know they had an assault pistol. We also one of the things we did not talk about is that I want to strengthen the tracking weapons tracking capacity of the Government when weapons pass through multiple hands. There may have been a gun show sale involved here. Depending on who bought it, we do not know what the background check would have occurred. What we do know is that if all these proposals were in place, they would save more lives more places. Just the Brady bill alone has kept a quarter of a million people from getting guns who had questionable backgrounds. There is no doubt in my mind that a lot of lives were saved. The assaults weapons ban is a good thing, but there are too many loopholes in it, and we want to close them. This just makes sense. ENTITY, you have admitted that access to guns is just part of the problem. Another part is parenting in this country, or lack thereof. What are parents doing wrong? Let me tell you a story, because I do not think it is so much as what they are doing as maybe as what they are not doing. A Member of the Congress, who is a friend of mine, and I had a conversation the other night. And he had just been with a high school, and he asked the students at the high school this was a few days after Littleton how many of them had talked to their parents about this. And he said only a small minority raised their hands. And one young woman stood up and said, I had to stand in front of the television and tell my parents we were going to not watch any more television until we talked about this, because I think they were afraid. They did not want to deal with the fact that this could happen in other places in America. I think that what we have to do is to, first of all, tell parents they have to assume responsibility for their children's television and video games and all that. They have to assume their family responsibility for that. But they also have to know, insofar as they possibly can, what is going on in their children's lives and minds. And we have to work with them to help them develop the skills necessary to determine if their kids need help and then get the help they need, whether it is counseling or mental health services or whatever. That sounds great, but do you enroll every parent in America in parenting classes? No. I think what you need is Hillary's told me this morning we got up, and we talked late, late last night about this. And then we got up this morning, and we were talking again. And she said I thought it was a great idea she said, What is worked in this country to change societies? We just had a big announcement today from Secretary Shalala that teen pregnancy's gone down for another year. There is been a national campaign against teen pregnancy, a real movement that asked all sectors of our society, starting with parents, but including everyone else, to do something on this. We have seen a decline in drunk driving, largely spurred, I think, by Mothers and Students Against Drunk Driving. We saw a national campaign to get people to wear their seatbelts when they were driving. And she said, and I agree, we need a national campaign that mobilizes all these things, that does not pretend that guns are the issue, that culture is the whole issue, that parents are the whole issue, that school safety is the whole issue but deals with all of this together. If the American people make up their mind that we are going to do better on this, we will do better. But as you know, ENTITY, parents and children and families are bombarded with these violent images every day on television, in the movies. Video games reward children for obliterating figures with virtual bullets and bombs. Many parents want to do the right thing, but these cultural influences are so enormously strong, they feel as if they are swimming against this tide. They are. I have two or three things to say about that. First of all, the first amendment prohibits us from banning some of these things, but we now have a television rating system, to go with the movies rating system. We will soon have all new televisions with a V-chip in them, so the rating systems can be enforced by parents. We are seeing more and more technology develop which will allow some websites to be blocked by parents, if they are inappropriate. We first have to try to get parents more control over the exposure of their children to the culture of violence. The second thing we have to do is to challenge the entertainment industry to minimize the use of gratuitous violence and not to present it in a way that will desensitize people to the pain, the agony, and ultimately, the finality of violence. But for many of those people, that is their stock-in-trade. It is, and there is a market for it. The American people buy it. They purchase it. They lap it up. But I think we have to face the fact that kids today are growing up in a culture that is more violent, culturally violent. The crime rate has been going down for 6 years overall, but the images are violent. And therefore, children that are more vulnerable are more likely, A, to be desensitized to violence and, then, to actually be desensitized to the impact of their employing violence. But I think in the end you have got to take it back to the fact that we all have responsibilities, and it starts with parents. We have to help convince our children that they should not have their actions controlled or directed outside them, and they should not let other people define what kind of people they are. And we have then got to do more in the schools, with counseling, with mediation, with getting mental health services where they need it. And we have got to then ask ourselves, what are the further responsibilities of the entertainment community? What are the responsibilities of the Government? Go back to the gun industry. Something they could do that I think would be great I am talking about the manufacturers now they ought to voluntarily come forward, as many have, and say, we are going to have more child trigger locks. They even are now developing technologies where a thumbprint can be imprinted on a gun and only the people who have the print can fire the gun. There are lots of things that can be done, but if we are all caught up in this and it becomes our obsession, I know we will do better. I know we will. Some Members of Congress have asked for an emergency summit meeting at the White House with leaders of the entertainment industry. Do you plan to have that summit? Well, I plan to bring some high-level folks from the entertainment industry and from other sectors of our society that I think can be active here together at the White House in the near future, and then figure out how we can put together the elements of a national campaign. I think the entertainment industry is going to have to be a big part of it. What I think is a mistake is I think it would be a mistake for the people who do not want to offend the NRA to blame Hollywood and the people that do not want to offend Hollywood to blame the NRA, instead of keeping our children and their safety and their future in mind and asking ourselves, what should we do about guns? What should we do about culture? What should we do about the schools? How can we help the parents? And what is Government's responsibility? Those are the big questions. We should ask and answer all of them, not just one. ENTITY, can you say to Hollywood executives, Look, I need your help ? Or is it tough to put pressure on them, given the fact that they have been so supportive of you and so generous to your campaigns? No. No, it is easier for me to do, I think, in some ways, because I know them. Keep in mind, the first time I went out to Hollywood and did this in a highly public way was in late 1993. And then we got a lot of Hollywood executives in, and they played a major role in the development of the television rating systems, which was essential to make the V-chip work. So we got a lot of support out of the entertainment community for the rating systems and for the V-chip. We have gotten a remarkable amount of support in the years since from the high-tech community for control technologies on the Internet. So I think that they do not go as far as I wish they would often on the violent content of some movies and some television shows and some video games, but there has been progress made. One of the big problems we have got now is to make sure parents understand how to use the V-chip on television and understand how to use the blocking technologies on the Internet. Most parents are like me; they are not nearly as computer literate as their children are. And we have got a big job there to do. But yes, I have no problem asking them to do more and challenging them to do more. That is easy. The difficult thing is to ask all of those questions of all of those people I mentioned. That is why I think the First Lady's idea of having a national campaign in which we all get caught up is the right way to go here. And yet, it inevitably gets so mired in politics, and the best of intentions, it seems, are Well, I think the only thing that gets mired in politics on this score, really, is when you have to pass a bill in Congress that is opposed by powerful interest groups. But otherwise, I think at a community level and in terms of empowering the schools and the parents and organizing groups to demand changes, I think it will be pretty straightforward. And even in Congress, as I told this group I spoke to a few days ago, if the American people want change badly enough, the Congress will respond. They will go beyond partisan politics. They will go beyond interest group politics. If they believe the American people want it bad enough, they will respond. ENTITY, thank you again for your time. We really appreciate it. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithkatiecouricthenationalbroadcastingcorporation", "title": "Interview With Katie Couric of the National Broadcasting Corporation", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-katie-couric-the-national-broadcasting-corporation", "publication_date": "29-04-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 480, "text": "ENTITY, nice to see you always. Welcome, welcome. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. We are glad you are here. Thank you very much. Come on in to the Oval Office. We are grateful for this. Thank you. This is great. It is an interesting history here, and I kind of think one thing that your viewers might be interested in knowing is that the first decision I ever made as President-but I was actually Presidentelect-was, what color rug do you want? And one of the important things is to surround yourself with people who you can trust and delegate. In this case, I delegated the rug design to Laura, my wife. But I told her, I said, I want the rug to have a message, and that is optimistic guy goes to work here. And so, as you can see, the rug really lights up the room. And I am optimistic about the future of the Middle East. Well, that is a great note, sir. You have been here 8 years. A few weeks and you are going to be leaving. I am going home. You sat on this desk for 8 years, and you took many decisions regarding our region. You launched the greater Middle East initiative that you want to democratize, reform the Middle East. In retrospect, do you think that vision was realized? Would you do anything differently? Well, I think it began- it is the beginning of a very difficult vision to implement. But I felt it was necessary for a couple of important reasons. One, I believe we are in an ideological struggle against people who want to achieve their ideological vision through the use of violence and murder. And I believe it is essential that you have an alternative available for people; the one I happen to believe in is based upon liberty. I do not think this is an American vision, see. And I tell people this, that I do believe there is a universal God, and a gift of that Almighty to all of us, whether we be Methodists or Muslims or nothing, is freedom. And so freedom is a great alternative. But I also believe there is a moral calling. If you believe there is an Almighty God, and a gift of that Almighty to everybody is freedom, then I think you have to-if you can do something about it, that you have to act on that, so that moms can grow up in a society that is hopeful for their children, you know, that their children are-can realize dreams. And to me the best type of society to do that is freedom. But it is very hard; it is difficult. And so you have to plant a seed, and you have to cultivate the seed, and eventually the crops will bloom. And we are beginning to see the crops beginning to bloom in parts of the Middle East. Sir, some people say that the war on terror is a war on Islam. Yes. Yet you went to the first mosque after 9/11, and you spoke there. How do you convince people in the Middle East that George Bush is not fighting a war against Islam? No, I know, and it troubles my soul, because I believe we are all God's children. And I hear people say, George Bush does not like Muslims, he wants to fight Muslims. And first, I thank you for giving me the chance to, hopefully, set the record straight. But I am objecting to anybody who murders innocent people to achieve their objectives. I do not think people who murder in the name of religion are truly religious people. And secondly, I would hope that people would know that when we try to use some of our influence to help on education programs, for example, or we welcome students, Saudi students, to the United States to study here, that it is a sign of respect and a sign of my desire to reach out to all people regardless of their religion. Absolutely. wanted also to ask you about, in the last 8 years, if you look back, would you do things differently? Would you have done things that you probably thought for a second-for the second time, I would have done them a different way? I am sure there will be. I mean, there is been some disappointments. Like what? Well, like, Abu Ghraib was a terrible disappointment. And admittedly, I was not there on the site, but I was the Commander in Chief of a military where these disgraceful acts took place that sent the absolute wrong image about America and our military. You know, parts of Iraq, it is taken longer than I thought it would. On the other hand, I am pleased to see a multiethnic society begin to emerge. I talked to the leaders of Iraq yesterday and today and congratulated them on doing some hard work. And I love to hear their spirit in their voice. And so I am confident history will say, Oh, Bush could have done it better here, or, Bush could have done it better there. But I think from the strategic point of view, I am confident that the idea of moving liberty in the region, a two-state solution to help the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the liberation of Iraq, and the follow-up with the- to help the Iraqis realize their sovereignty-a strong push-back against Iran- I believe when people objectively analyze this administration, they will say, Well, I see now what he was trying to do. I mean, the Arab peace initiative, it was a framework. Do you think that President-elect Obama should use it in terms of achieving peace in the Middle East? I definitely think it was a major breakthrough for then Crown Prince, now His Majesty, King Abdallah, to take the initiative and lay out the conditions for peace. And it is, I think, a useful foundation to help solve a longstanding problem. I do believe there will be a Palestinian state. I feel comfortable in saying that the decision-my decision to promote a Palestinian state, being the first President to do so, was the right thing for peace- right thing for peace for the Palestinians, right thing for peace for the Israelis. And His Majesty was very useful and very bold in laying out the Arab peace initiative. We are going to talk about all this in details so-- Yes, come on, I will show you the Rose Garden. --let us walk and talk as we go down to the Map Room. You have seen the Rose Garden before. I have, many times. Many times. Thank you, sir. It is beautiful. It is a beautiful day. What are you going to miss most about this place? Well, you know, I will miss a lot. I am-I have got such respect for our military, and I admire people in our military so very much. I will miss being the Commander in Chief. But you know, the White House is full of incredibly gracious and kind people who work hard to make family life as normal as possible. And so I will miss a lot of the people we work with here. And what is your plans? Well, I am going to move back to Texas. And what are you going to do there? And I am going to, you know, write a book, I think, about what it was like to be President and some of the hard decisions I had to make. I am going to start a institute that will promote freedom. And this will be an interesting place, particularly in regards to the Middle East, because this will be a place where there will be a forum for people with different issues to come and discuss. You know, I would love to have, you know, Palestinians, such as the President or the Prime Minister, to come and describe to the Americans what it was like to be in that part of the world. Or you know, there is just a lot of really interesting opportunities for people to come and lecture and think and talk. And in your book, obviously, we are talking about foreign policy. Most of it happened in the Middle East-okay, we are off camera now. I hope the guy is okay. A lot of-yes. He fell into the Rose Garden. ENTITY, thank you very much for this exclusive interview with us-- Thank you. --and thank you very much for granting us, to MEBC, and to me, personally, on behalf of Arab media. I really do appreciate it; I am very grateful. Thank you. I have enjoyed working with you. You have been a very fair journalist, and it is been a pleasure to have known you. Thank you, sir. You are the first American President to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. You had hoped that you would have this state realized when you leave office. Do you think that you could have done more? Do you think that you have thrown all of the weight of the U.S. behind this vision? Absolutely. We threw all the muscle and all the weight of the United States behind the vision. I am-you know, I wish there would have been a clearly defined state by the time I left office. However, I do take comfort in a couple of things. One, the attitude toward a Palestinian state has shifted. I think there is universal recognition in the region that in order for there to be peace, there must be two states living side by side in peace. Secondly, I am pleased that Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, after Annapolis, have worked very hard to narrow the differences on a variety of issues. And they have; they have made substantial progress. Thirdly, I am pleased that there is the Arab peace plan, which is an essential part of creating the conditions for a Palestinian state to evolve. Fourthly, I am grateful that at the Annapolis conference all Arab nations were represented, which is an important signal, because I learned a lesson in studying previous efforts for peace that there must be regional buy-in. In other words, the nations in the region must stand with the Palestinians, in particular, and say this is-we support you. And so-and fifthly, by the way, I am pleased with the progress being made to help the development of an infrastructure in the West Bank. Prime Minister Fayyad has asked for help. A lot of nations are helping, including the United States; we are helping with security measures. Generals Dayton and Jones have been very helpful. My friend Prime Minister Blair-former Prime Minister Blair, who was here the other night for dinner-and I talked about the economics that are beginning to take place in the region. In other words, a state can be defined on paper, but it also has to be defined in a civil society and a strong economy. And it is beginning to happen. How do you see the Palestinian issue evolving in the next few years? I mean, Prime Minister Tony Blair said, actually, there is no peace without Gaza, and I guess that means Hamas as well. Do you share that vision? I share the vision that the only way there is going to be peace is where those who assume that violence is necessary to achieve peace cannot be a part of the process. In other words, people have to renounce violence in order to have peace. It is contradictory to say, I am going to use violence to achieve my objectives, and oh, by the way, I am for peace. And so ultimately, Gaza has got to be- look, Gaza has to be a part of a Palestinian state, and the Palestinian state has to be contiguous territory; it cannot look like Swiss cheese. And it is got to be a state in which the sovereignty of the Palestinian people is-reigns supreme. So you are confident it is going to emerge? I am. I really am. There will be fits and starts. I mean, if this were a straight line between vision and reality, it would have happened. But there is a lot of complicating factors. Obviously, the terrorists create complicating factors. Secondly, politics creates complicating factors, both within the Palestinians, as well as the Israelis, as we have seen. But nevertheless, the foundation is there. People-if you give people a choice, ultimately give them a choice between two states side by side in peace or this unresolved dispute, what would they choose? They would choose peace. And this will happen. What will ENTITY pick up from where you left? Well, I think we have left it in good shape. We have left it with the vision intact. In other words, a lot of people now share the vision of two states. As I say, there is been progress between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian President toward what a state should look like. I think the Israelis are getting-be more comfortable with the notion that a state will not create less security for them, but more security for them. And the Arab world, because of the Arab initiative as well as the Annapolis conference, are showing more and more willingness to be constructive partners in getting peace. The U.S. and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have a close strategic relationship. You personally have a very good working relationship with King Abdallah. Yet you do not see eye to eye on many issues. How did you resolve that? I think we do. I think we got-I think we agree more than we disagree. First of all, I hold His Majesty in high respect. I appreciate, for example, the religious dialogue that he instigated, and I was honored to be invited to go to New York. I thought that was a very smart way to help promote understanding, and understanding eventually leads to peace. He is a man who understands that terrorists can destroy his own society. And so I-I do not know if the world understands this or not, but Saudi Arabia has been very firm in dealing with Al Qaida. And remember, it was Al Qaida that tried to blow up their oil infrastructure; they killed their citizens. And His Majesty knows full well that that kind of terrorism cannot coexist with a peaceful society. When I have my discussions with him, I find there is a lot more common ground than not. So there is no disagreement with the Palestinian issue with what-- I think His Majesty-look, the Arab peace initiative actually talks about, you know, Israel solving its problems with Lebanon and Syria and the Palestinians, and there will be universal recognition when that happens. And so to me that is a very positive statement. And that the idea of a Palestinian state as part-as far as being part of the solution to the overall problem is something I believe he agrees with. I do not want to put words in his mouth, because he is my dear friend. In the recent years, there was an emergence of Qatar as a regional player in many of the countries in the Middle East. Do you see that played on the-kind of at the expense of traditional allies of the U.S., like Saudi Arabia and Egypt? I think it is going to be very important for the initiatives instigated by Qatar to show results, for example, with Hamas. Now, Hamas-in my judgment, the violent wing of Hamas damages the prospects for a Palestinian state. Or with Hizballah-I believe that Hizballah is a very destabilizing influence, particularly when they resort to violence. So what I would look for, and do look for, and would hope the next President would look for is, okay, are these initiatives bearing fruit? We, of course, appreciate, you know, our basing agreement with Qatar, and we thank them very much for that. And we would hope that they would follow through to deliver the results for peace, which is what we all want, I hope. We are going to move to Iraq. Recently, the U.S. and the Iraqi Government have signed the status of forces agreement. What do you think of it? I think that the strategic framework agreement and the status of forces agreement is a sign that the Iraqi democracy is emerging and is healthy. There was a lot of debate on the SFA and SOFA, and there were people that were-you know, a lot of people were saying, well, this will be bad for Iraq, and others say this will be good for Iraq. And after the debate was over, it was ratified by the people's assembly, and I think that is a healthy sign. I also think it is very good to have an agreement in place that recognizes the sovereignty of Iraq and recognizes that the United States will be moving its forces out of cities and then eventually out of the country based upon success. In retrospect, would you think that this war could be averted? We tried to avert it. I know people say, Oh, George Bush likes to use the military. That is the hardest thing for a President to do, is to put soldiers in harm's way, because I knew what would happen. And you know, that is of course manifested when I meet with mothers of fallen soldiers or wives or husbands. And it is incredibly sad, as I am sure you can imagine, very emotional, to hug and to cry with families. And I have met with a lot of families-a lot-so I knew the consequences. I really did. And I was hoping that through diplomatic pressure that we would be able to resolve this issue peacefully. And I remember-you cannot take this Iraq out of the post-9/11 context. We'd been attacked, and here is a man who I have said repeatedly, you know, was not directly involved in 9/11, but had used weapons of mass destruction and had supported terror and had paid the families of suicide bombers and was a sworn enemy of the United States and had invaded two countries and had ignored, you know, 17 or however many resolutions in the United Nations. He was a threat. But I did go to the United Nations, as you remember. Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences, is what 1441 said. And I firmly believe the choice was Sad-dam Hussein's to make, and he made a fateful choice. Then the interesting point was, after he was removed, with a broad coalition of countries, what do we do? You know, do we pick a strong man and say, here is America's guy and put him in there? Or do we work so that the Iraqi citizens would be able to pick their own form of government and their own people? And that is what we chose to do, and it is been really hard. Was it worth it? Absolutely. I believe a Middle East with Saddam Hussein in power today would be different, much different than the one today. I think you'd see a man with a lot of oil wealth willing to use terrorist connections to try to compete, for example, with Hizballah. There could conceivably be a nuclear arms race taking place, while even though Saddam Hussein did not have nuclear weapons, it is certain, at least to the experts, that he still had the capacity to make nuclear weapons. And there would be nothing more destabilizing for the Middle East than to see Iran trying to develop a nuclear weapon and Iraq trying to develop a nuclear weapon. So I think the Middle East is a much better place without Saddam Hussein in power, and the sacrifices by both the Iraqi people and the coalition forces to achieve where we are today.But some say, sir, that the removal of Saddam Hussein has bolstered Iran and make emergent as a regional superpower. I disagree completely with that. I think the emergence of a democratic and stable Iraq on Iran's border is in the- will help more likely keep the peace vis-a-vis Iran in the Middle East. Secondly, what has changed with Iran is universal recognition about the dangers of Iran having a-the capacity to make a nuclear weapon. And therefore, one of the objectives of my administration is to create an international coalition all saying the same thing, which is, you have defied the IAEA, therefore, you cannot be trusted to say that you are only enriching for civilian nuclear power; therefore, stop your process, verify they stopped their enrichment process; otherwise, there will continue to be international sanctions. The Iranian-recently your administration has been involved diplomatically with the Iranians. Do you think that actually you can bring them to the international fold by engaging them diplomatically? We are trying to-we have offered them a way forward; it is verifiably suspend your enrichment. And we will be at the table with other nations. And so, well, we discussed Iraq with Iran in a regional context. But we have said there is-if you want to have diplomatic relations and discussions with the United States, verifiably suspend your enrichment program. Our objective is to stop their gain of knowledge that would enable them to build a nuclear weapon, because having a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing to the region. And so there is a way forward for them to have diplomacy. But it is their choice, and thus far, they have not chosen to do it. And I regret that our relations are with Iran-are this way, because I have great respect for the Iranian people and the Iranian history. And I know that they can have a better future with the rest of the world, if their leadership were to abandon its desire to learn how to build a nuclear weapon. I have a few questions about just Syria and Lebanon, but my time is over. Well, thank you for your-you are a beautiful interviewer. Thank you, sir. So can I go ahead? Quickly. And then I really do have to go. Sure, absolutely. I wanted to talk about Syria. Basically, the U.S. attacked Syria. But do you see-- The U.S.-- --attacked Syria recently. There was a target inside Syria that was attacked by-- Allegedly, yes. Allegedly. But do you see this kind of tension will succeed soon, or do you see the U.S. diplomatically engaged in Syria? First of all, we discussed no operations. Secondly, we have engaged Syria early in my administration with Secretary Colin Powell and others. And our message was, if you'd like to have better relations with us, stop housing Hamas, violent Hamas, stop destabilizing the democracy of Lebanon, stop facilitating the flow of terrorists into Iraq, be a constructive neighbor to countries, and we can have better relations. And they have, thus far, chosen to do that. Again, there is a way forward. But my worry about just sitting down with people and hoping that they end up behaving differently is that oftentimes it reinforces behavior that is not in our interests. And so I believe in conditional diplomacy. Now, there is a lot of multilateral diplomacy going on out of this administration. But in this case, just like Iran, we will have diplomatic relations if you choose, but there is got to be behavioral change in order to justify it. And can you stabilize Lebanon? I have been trying to-one of the great successes has been to get 30,000 or so Syrian troops out of Lebanon. I think one of the real keys to peace in the Middle East is Lebanon. And Lebanon is a democracy. I have met their President recently here in the Oval Office, which- had a very a good discussion. I have been very impressed by Prime Minister Siniora's courage and boldness. We want to help Lebanon have an armed forces that are effective, so that they can protect their people. And we have been working very hard for 7 years to free Lebanon as much as possible from foreign interference, so that its democracy can grow and mature and be a stable contributor to the region. How would you like the people in the Middle East to remember you? I would hope they would remember me as George W. Bush, as a man who respects their religion, respects human rights and human dignity, and prays for peace. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnadiabilbassychartersmbctv", "title": "Interview With Nadia Bilbassy Charters of MBC TV", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-nadia-bilbassy-charters-mbc-tv", "publication_date": "05-12-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 390, "text": "Just a couple of comments. One, I am looking forward to going to the G-8. It is always a good opportunity to talk about common values, common interests, ways we can work together to improve the world. I am looking forward to seeing the leaders. I have got a good personal relationship with the leaders. It is a good chance to visit. Agenda items are-important agenda items: Africa, I just gave a speech on the continent of Africa; global climate change, it is important to move the debate beyond the Kyoto era and talk about what we can do together to improve the environment. I am looking forward to that. One of the things there has not been much focus on is, there will be time to discuss progress in the Middle East-the Middle East peace process. Jim Wolfensohn is coming to discuss a way forward, how we can all help the Palestinians improve their security, enhance the entrepreneurial spirit so people can see their lives improve. We are looking forward to that. Anyway, it is going to be a good trip. I am looking forward to going to Denmark. The Prime Minister is a friend. He is a good man. He is got a good, strong backbone. When he says he is going to do something, he means it. I am looking forward to seeing Her Majesty the Queen. It is going to be a good experience. I have never been to Denmark, so I am looking forward to going. Charlie, we will start with you, and then we will do a couple of rounds, and I will let you all go get some lunch. All right. My first question really is an aid question, with respect to Africa. Mr. Blair has really been pressing this issue of dramatically increased aid to Africa. You have substantially increased U.S. assistance to Africa, but on the other hand, it falls way short of what Mr. Blair has been asking for. You have been really, I think, fairly cool to both the $25 billion that he is asked and the commitment for, what is it, seven-tenths of a percent of GDP for foreign assistance. A couple of comments on that. One is that our aid increase has been dramatic. We have tripled our aid since I have been President, and I just announced today that I will ask Congress to double it by 2010, which is a significant increase. Secondly, though, you have got to look at Africa as more than just aid. Aid is one aspect of participating on the continent in a compassionate way. Trade is a vital part of lifting people out of poverty. The other thing is, you know, there is all kinds of ways to calculate generosity. I happen to think that the formula that some people try to use is not an effective way to judge America's generosity or a fair way. For example, we have got a Tax Code structure to encourage private citizens to contribute. And so I will remind our G-8 friends that aid to developing countries is more than just grants from Government. It is grants from Government. It is generous contributions by private individuals, and we contribute billions on an annual basis. I am also going to tell people that a compassionate policy is one that focuses less on formulas and more on improving people's lives. And so today I talked about the malaria initiative, for example. There is a great place where the G-8 countries can come together and help nations on the continent of Africa eradicate malaria. So I am going to the G-8 with an agenda, where we have been the leader. The HIV/ AIDS initiative was a powerful statement of our compassion and our willingness to take the lead on a lot of issues. Another subject which will be in some way at the G-8 meeting also, Iraq. Denmark is contributing a substantial proportion of the amount of troops to the conflict. Your most recent speech continuously made the link between the conflict and 9/11. How do you react towards those who say that connection has been disproved and that growing skepticism in this country and even more in Europe cannot simply be dismissed by your resolve to stay the course, as you say? My point was, about September the 11th, is that America was attacked, and now we are at war in a global war on terror. That is the connection with September the 11th. Some in Europe, I recognize, view September the 11th as a terrible moment. We view it as not only a terrible moment but a clear indication that we are at war with an ideology, people that are willing to use terror to spread their ideology. So my speech, if you look carefully at how it was written-I am confident you did, Klaus-shows that I was making the connection between the attack and the global war on terror that we now face- and the ideology of those who attacked us is very similar to those that have now gone into Iraq to try to stop the progress-and make clear, our strategy is to find the terrorists, bring them to justice before they harm us here, as well as defeat the ideology of hate with an ideology of hope, and that is democracy. Our strategy in Iraq is to promote a stable democracy, in other words, encourage political progress and, at the same time, train up the Iraqis so they can do the fighting. And I look forward to sharing my thoughts about the progress we are making with your Prime Minister. They have been- Denmark has been a steadfast ally, and I know he has obviously stood strong in the face of political pressures, made a decision based upon what he thought was right for the world, spreading peace. I strongly believe that we are laying the foundation for peace for generations to come. I reject the notion that certain countries cannot be democratic. I view that elitist-I view that as condemning people to hopelessness. Our policy up to now, prior to September the 11th, was, Why do not we just kind of tolerate tyranny and hope for the best. It does not work that way, and we learned a strong lesson. The speech, I think you will see, was that the attack indicated we are at war, and Iraq is part of that war. Otherwise, why would people be pouring into the country trying to defeat us? Why? Because they fear democracy. They fear the competing ideology that is a hopeful ideology. ENTITY, a question about your malaria program. Sure. By the time we get back to the office, there will probably be a statement from some group praising your proposal but saying once again, Why did not the President go through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria? Why do a separate program? Well, first of all, we are supporting the Global Fund. But like our AIDS Initiative, we also feel it is an effective way to achieve results. See, you just asked a process question. You are assuming somebody is going to-let us focus on the process. What I want the world to do is focus on how best to get the job done, how best to achieve the objective. And so our strategy has been two-fold: one, support the Global Fund; but on the other hand, target specific countries. And if you noticed, I said in there, this will- we are taking the lead. We want people to follow. We want people in other countries to follow-we want people to follow. And the United States Government is going to take the lead. The Gates Foundation is taking the lead, and I call upon other governments, other foundations, to do the same. So our strategy is one of results, how best to achieve the objective. Give me your name again. Olivier. You can call me Mr. Knox. That is fine. Pretty good. Pretty good retort. Very good. Olivier. Thank you, sir. Sir, were you surprised when you heard the allegations that the President-elect of Iran might have been one of the people who took Americans hostage in Tehran? And do you have any information that would confirm or refute those charges? I have no information, but obviously, this is-his involvement raises many questions, and knowing how active people are at finding answers to questions, I am confident they will be found. And I spoke to Prime Minister Blair this morning, spoke to Chancellor Schroeder the other day. I look forward to speaking to Jacques Chirac when we get to Scotland. My message is, is that it is very important at this moment for the EU-3 to send a strong message to the new person there that the world is united in saying that you should not be given the capabilities of enriching uranium, which could then be converted into a nuclear weapon. In other words, we have got a new man who has assumed power, and he must hear a focused message. I was pleased with Gerhard Schroeder's statement here, and Prime Minister Blair can speak for himself. But let me just say, I believe the EU-3's message is going to be a very strong message, and that is where our message is-that is where my attention is focused right now. In order to achieve a diplomatic objective, it is very important to have clear goals. And we have a clear goal, and that is to say to the Iranians-well, there is a clear understanding that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon. It would be a very destabilizing, dangerous situation. And the world is speaking in one voice, and so the message now to the new leader is a very strong message. With regard to trade, African leaders have been pretty loud in pointing out that subsidies and tariffs are a tremendous handicap to the development of trade. Europe, in particular, has been hostile to really lifting tariffs and subsidies. Any chance of any movement on that, within the context of the G-8? Well, I appreciate you bringing that up. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, signed by my predecessor and extended by the Congress in my administration, is working. I want to remind people that ultimately it is commerce, trade, economic growth that will overwhelm the need for aid itself. And exports from sub-Sahara Africa to the United States are up 88 percent because we have opened up our markets. The best approach to dealing with Europe-and our own subsidies for that mat-ter-on agricultural matters, is to go to the Doha round of the WTO and jointly declare that we are going to get rid of all agricultural subsidies. That has been our proposal. The other thing is, it is very important for African nations themselves to eliminate the barriers of trade intracontinent, between themselves. There are, if you look- at least there was the last time I looked- there were some impediments to trade amongst the African nations. And so the- we have all got responsibilities to make trade freer. I said in my speech today that it is -the World Bank estimated that a successful Doha round-in other words, a new trading regime that enabled all countries to trade freely, would lift 140 million people out of poverty, in their estimate. And that is why this Doha round is very important. And so we will spend time articulating how best to continue moving forward on the Doha round. That is probably the most-the place where you are going to find that would be most effective in being able to deal with the subsidies, whether it be the EU or our own subsidies for that matter. Guantanamo is still a very hot topic for many Europeans. After 3 years, there are still prisoners there who have not had their case heard. And the U.N. now are talking about investigating secret U.S. prisons and detainee facilities. Is that a thing- in the investigation, the U.S. would cooperate with? And do not you have fears that this is going to harm the U.S. image a lot if this situation goes on for years? Well, I think-I think if the truth is not told, it is a problem. But let us talk about the truth, in terms of Guantanamo. First of all, there is inspections 24 hours a day, 7 days a week available for the International Red Cross. There is been a lot of press contingents down to take a look at the situation firsthand and a lot of congressional folks going down. In other words, a lot of people-there is a transparent situation there. I think we probably had about 800 or so people detained there, and remember, Klaus, I made a decision as to what to do with people swept off of a battlefield who did not wear uniforms. I mean, this is a different kind of war. I made the decision they would be treated humanely, just like the Geneva Accords insist, and they have been. Of the 800 detained, some 200 or so have been sent back to their countries. In other words, we screened and analyzed and took a look at whether they would be a threat again. I am in a dilemma-at one point during this process, because people were let back out on the-sent back to a country, and they ended up killing an American. What do I tell the loved one? In other words, these people were fighting. They were fighters. They were on the battlefield. Secondly, I agree with you. We need to make sure there is a way forward. And that is why I set up military commissions. But the military-and by the way, in a military commission, people would have lawyers; they would have-there would be procedures, court procedures. Unfortunately- or fortunately, I should not -let me take that back-what has happened has been that our court system is analyzing, making a judicial decision as to whether or not the military-these people should be tried in a military commission or in a civilian court, and we are awaiting a verdict on that. And once that happens, then there will be a way forward. ENTITY, a question about debt cancellation. Yes. The G-8 finance ministers came up with a figure of 18 countries. Shortly after that, a number of African Presidents meeting in Nigeria said, It is a good start. We'd like more. Is that 18 figure carved in stone, or is there-- Not at all, Joe. There is a-it is a criterion-based agreement, and that other countries will be able to qualify for debt forgiveness as well. So there is a way forward for the other countries that they expressed concerns about. The other thing is, is that I would hope people would take notice of the initiative that I proposed a couple of years ago, and that is the World Bank, in its desire to help developing nations, give grants as opposed to loans. And we are making progress toward that goal. Jim Wolfensohn did a fine job of making progress toward that goal, and Paul Wolfowitz will continue toward that goal. But the idea is that we are relieving the pressure on the balance sheet. But governments have got to make good choices. They have got to be willing to invest and fight corruption, kind of like the criterion in our Millennium Challenge Account, which is a very important initiative. It is one I called on Congress to fund. Congress has been reluctant to fully fund our request because we have not got the money out the door fast enough. And so my message today was, like it has been the last couple of times I have talked about Millennium Challenge Account, we will do a better job of processing and moving along. Thank you, sir. One more round after this, so everybody be preparing your questions. On Darfur, sir, the Deputy Secretary of State told the House Foreign Relations Committee this week or last that the United States and Europe should not send troops to Darfur because they would come up against bloodthirsty, coldblooded killers. Does this mean that the bloodthirsty, cold-blooded killers can set the agenda in Darfur? And what do you say to some critics who say that your administration is easing off Sudan because of good counterterrorism intelligence cooperation? That is a preposterous claim. It is not even close to the truth. First, my administration, with Jack Danforth and Colin Powell's good work, helped solve the north-south civil war. And now we are working close-working with parties to get that peace agreement implemented. Secondly, the strategy, an effective strategy, is to work with the AU-African Union-and use AU forces to help keep the warring parties apart while we continue to press the Sudanese Government as well as rebel groups for a comprehensive settlement. And the United States has helped- worked with NATO and the EU to provide logistical support for the movement of 7,700 troops into Darfur. Today I announced it will help build 16 additional base camps; it will provide maintenance services, as well as C-130 to help remove Rwandan troops. We spend a lot of time on this important issue. Ours is a nation that called this a genocide. And we take this situation in Darfur very seriously-and, by the way, lead in terms of aid and working with other nations. Canada, by the way, has come up with a big tranche of aid the other day, for which we are grateful. What are you telling or asking Thabo Mbeki now, as Robert Mugabe intensifies his crackdown against his opposition in Zimbabwe? As you know, Thabo Mbeki was here. You might remember, I did go to South Africa as well. And my message has been very consistent: You are a great democracy. You are showing the world what is possible after the terrible period of apartheid. In other words, you showed how to reconcile differences, and you are a very strong nation on the continent of Africa. And next door to you is a person that is destroying a country because of bad policy, and it is not right. And the nations in the neighborhood must be strong. I was asked yesterday, are we willing to tie some of our aid to the position that nations take on Zimbabwe? I said no because I do not want people to suffer as a result of-more people to suffer as a result of Zimbabwe. In other words, our aid is focused at people. And on the other hand, working with nations and providing help and aid and trade and, you know, partnering does give us a chance to lend our voice to others who are saying, This has got to change in Zimbabwe. He is a terrible example. Are you disappointed in Mbeki? I am disappointed in Mugabe. He is-Zimbabwe was a bread basket, provided a lot of food on a continent that often needs food, and it is a country being wrecked. And I am-the world needs to speak very clearly about the decisions he has made and the consequence of the decisions he has made. You have already expressed your admiration for the Danish Prime Minister, but I wondered if there were other good reasons behind your decision to take the detour to our tiny country like Denmark and even ruining part of your birthday by doing that? No, no, it is enhancing it- it is enhancing it. Listen, Denmark has been a great friend of the United States for years. And I hope my visit sends a statement to the Danish people: Thank you for the friendship. I do not expect everybody to agree with the decisions my administration has made-- You know there will be demonstrations in Denmark? That is fine. Good. That is the great thing about going to a free society, see. One of the things about-a wonderful thing about freedom is, people are able to express their opinions, and I expect people to express their opinions. On the other hand, I would hope my visit says to the Danish people that America respects you and we share values. And those shared values are important. They are universal values. They are not American values or Danish values. They are universal values, freedom of speech and minority rights, human dignity. So I am looking forward to it. Selfishly, I am looking forward to going to Denmark. I have never been there, and I cannot wait to see it. Now, admittedly, I am not going to take the typical tourist tour. I do not expect you will find me walking the streets of-you know, in the evening, arm in arm with my wife. On the other hand, I bet I get to see enough of the country to give me a good sense of the beauty of the country. I am really looking forward to it. Do you plan to bring all your family members and your wife? I am bringing wife, for certain, and a family member. All my family members? It is a lot. If you are talking about my daughters, one of my daughters will be accompanying me. Thank you for asking. ENTITY, David Dodge, the Governor of Canada's Central Bank, questions the whole G-8 process, saying it really should not be focusing on Africa and climate change but rather global prosperity and economic imbalances. And he says that a new mechanism, a new institution is needed that includes China, India, and South Africa. What do you think about that? You know, the G-8 conferences used to be focused strictly on global-you know, economic-our respective economies, and it is an economic discussion. And it is an interesting growth out of just talking about economics to just understanding that together we can make a difference by helping developing nations grow their economies as well. It is really what you are talking about. The ultimate success on the continent of Africa is going to be whether or not strong economies develop, being able to give people a chance to succeed. And many of the initiatives we are focused on will lay the conditions for economic growth. And you cannot grow if you are at war. That is why I talked about the peacekeeping initiatives. You cannot grow if you have got a huge part of the future of your nation being wiped out because of HIV/AIDS. It is very difficult to grow if you do not educate your women, and that is why I announced a very strong initiative for the education of girls on the continent of Africa. These are projects- it is hard to grow when you have got a million people dying of malaria because of the inability to treat a mosquito bite. I mean, there is something very practical about dealing with-dealing with, on the continent of Africa, the nations, helping nations, partnering nations. And I think it speaks to the admonition that To whom much is given, much is required. And so I find this an important part of an agenda. It should not be the only agenda. We are definitely talking about the environment, definitely talking about Africa. But we will also be talking about the Palestinian conflict. There is a chance for G-8 nations, developed nations to help the Palestinians. We will be talking about our economies. There is always a nice discussion about currency, for example-an interesting part of the dialog. And I find it interesting to talk with other nations about what they are doing to stimulate their economies. I suspect this G-8-in other words, there will be very-current events will be discussed one way or the other. Iraq, of course, will be discussed. But obviously, one of the interesting parts of this G-8 that folks will be looking at will be the recent issues within the EU. And my message there will be the same as it was here when Jose Barroso and others came, Juncker came, and I said, Look, we want Europe to succeed. We want there to be a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. And we want Europe to be successful in its enterprise, and we want it to be growing. I mean, after all, we have got enormous trade with Europe, and trade is an important part of raising standards of living. If that is the case, you want your trading partner to be healthy. And so we will be discussing-I am confident there will be some discussions about what has taken place. I am looking forward to it. In other words, a broad agenda makes sense to me. But just a quick follow up-- Yes. What about including India and China and South Africa? Well, no, India and China and South Africa will be there. Absolutely. There will be some African nations there. There will be India, China, Brazil, and Mexico-I cannot remember all the nations-but yes, there will be a forum or a discussion including those countries. I am particularly interested in discussing energy with China. One of the-we had a problem with Kyoto because Kyoto would have-we did not think the way forward to really achieve an objective we wanted because, first of all, Kyoto would really have hurt our economy a lot. Kyoto did not include countries like India and China. And now is the chance to work with developed nations and developing nations to develop a way to share technologies, for example, that will enable us to achieve the objective we want. And the United States recognizes there is warming, and that some of that is caused by manmade emissions. But we also recognize that we are dependent upon foreign sources of oil. We want to diversify away from fossil fuels, and we want to help developing nations do the same. And so we have a great opportunity, because of the presence of these nations at this moment to discuss how to go forward. And so, he is right. They should be included, and they are. Final question, Olivier. Thank you, sir. Sir, you are coming back stag from Europe-- Coming back? Stag. Your wife is going on to Africa. That is an accurate statement. We understand from African sources that she is going to South Africa, Tanzania, and-- Interesting way to put it. You could have said, You are coming back alone from Europe, or You are coming back sans -- Oooh! But you say, You are coming back stag. If I'd known, I would have gone with the sans. You beat me to it, sir. Communications Director Dan Bartlett. Where is Gregory when you need him? That is right. Classic moment, was not it? Absolutely. Were you there for that? I was not, but I-- We are laughing about the fact that one of their comrades, a very important person in the White House pool went over to Paris, France, and fired off a series of questions to Jacques Chirac in French. My mother e-mailed the corrected French. That is good. I corrected his French too and did not even know what he was saying. This is all off the record, because this will hurt Gregory's feelings. Please. Holland, you are copiously taking notes. It is going right to him. Good. Communications Director Bartlett. He just had twins. He had twins? Communications Director Bartlett. Yes, last week. Fantastic. Gender? Communications Director Bartlett. A boy and a girl. Weight? Health? Good. Good. Mother? Communications Director Bartlett. Strong. They are in the fives. I think both of them are 5 pounds. That is good, 5. How big were yours? Communications Director Bartlett. Same, midsize. We are back-where were you? Well, we heard that your wife is going-- I am flying alone, yes. You are flying alone, sans First Lady. She is going to South Africa, Tanzania, Rwanda. My question to you is, what message is she bringing from the United States, and what can she get across that a diplomat or a rock star could not? Her message is: One, the United States is committed to Africa, and we have got a good record; secondly, that our commitment to Africa is aimed at helping people. She will be talking about educating young girls, and she will be talking about our HIV/AIDS initiative. Her presence shows commitment. This is the second time she is been to Africa since I have been sworn in as President. Plus, she is a darn good diplomat. She speaks clearly, and she is a- she is a compassionate soul when she speaks, which is-she is a genuinely compassionate person. And people will see her compassion. And there will be no problem with her getting any news coverage, so, in other words, she will be seen, which makes her an effective representative. And part of people knowing that the United States cares is for the messenger to have a platform. And so she will have a- she will have the ability to talk from her heart about the specific initiatives that we are very much involved in. All right, listen, thank you all. Looking forward to it. Klaus, see you over there? Are you going to be there? I leave that to my colleagues. You are going to lateral me. You are going to transfer me off. Well, I am sure they are going to be as professional as you were. I hope so. Nice to see you again. Thank you.

{"id": 394, "text": "Just a block from here, you may not have known it, you drove by houses with holes still in the roof, where there'd been live rescues. There is still FEMA markings in spray paint. And yet, New Orleans is like this. This is a symbol of recovery. Katrina was about so many things. It was about class and race and government and - and the environment. What ever happened to that national conversation we were supposed to have about it? Well, I think that we are still having it. I - I do not think that conversation happens in - one instance. I think that there is a constant evolving debate about what are our obligations to each other. How do we make sure that in moments of devastation that we are looking out for one another? How does government organize itself, both at the federal level interacting with state and local officials? How do we make sure that folks who were already vulnerable before a catastrophe hits are not made worse off as a consequence of it? And, you know, what you have seen I think in New Orleans is steady progress. But, you know, we have still got a long way to go. And part of the reason that I wanted to come down here today to mark the fifth anniversary, was just to send a message to the people of New Orleans, but also the entire Gulf Coast, that they have , you know, gotten hit pretty good over the last several years. And all of America, not just people here, not just folks in the White House, but all of America, remains concerned and remains committed to their rebuilding. Do you still get driven to anger over it when you see those pictures again after five years? Oh, absolutely. The - the children, the old folks, the people suffering in this city? Oh, well, you know, I still remember - I was in a London hotel room. I had just come back with Republican Senator Luger on a fact finding trip on nuclear issues. And we had gotten in - into London, we were at the hotel, and we suddenly we just saw this thing unfold. In ways that were searing to anybody with a conscience. And, you know, frankly, were a shock, I think, to many of us who did not think that something like that could happen in America. And you know, I meant - I meant - I referred today in my speech, immediately afterwards I flew back, went down to Houston with President Clinton and the first President Bush. And talked to folks who were - at that point - and I do not think even at that time we realized the full scope of the - of the disaster. But what - what it did do, though, was reawaken, I hope, a sense that we are all in this thing together. That, you know, we may be divided along political lines. We may have arguments, ideologically, about the best way to approach this or that problem. But when you have got something like a Katrina happen. When you have got major disasters. When you see people who are doing their best, but have just been overwhelmed that we have got to put all that stuff aside. And come in and make sure that we get the job done. The folks here still want a lot from you. I have been talking to them for a week. What would they ask you? They want you to come spend the night. They want you to treat their wetlands like an emergency, like the TVA or the Marshall Plan, because as they always say, they are losing a football field an hour. Right. Perversely, could BP money pay for the - the reengineering and the preservation of the wetlands potentially? Well, I think what everybody's understood is that we can build the best levees in the world. And we - we are going to be be on schedule for next year having gotten - all the levees strengthened, so that they can withstand a hundred year surge. You are confident? Well, I - we are on schedule right now. And I am going to be keep on making sure that we stay on schedule. We have already fortified 220 miles of levees. But the - the real protection for New Orleans and for the Gulf are the wetlands. And that is an environmental disaster that had been occurring long before Katrina. And I think in light of what is happened with the oil spill, this is an opportunity for us to take a look comprehensively all along the coast and say, How do we do things better? How do we do things smarter than we have done before? I assigned Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, who is a son of the Gulf. Former mayor, former governor of Mississippi. He is been traveling and listening and talking to folks all across this region. He will be working with our EPA director. All of our various agencies that are involved. To find out ways that we can leverage as much as possible the money that is going to be but needed for short term repair to make sure that we are doing things smarter over the long term. This was, of course, New Orleans' Katrina and Mississippi's Katrina. And you are familiar now that it is getting baked in a little bit in the media that BP was ENTITY's Katrina. And it is also getting baked in that the Administration was slow off the mark. Is that unfair? Well, I - it is just not accurate. If you take a look at our response the only thing in common we had with - the Katrina response was Thad Allen, who came in and helped to organize rescue efforts - and he did so under Katrina, he did so for us. But if you look, we had immediately thousands of vessels, tens of thousands of people who are here. And what we are seeing now is that we have got a lot more work to do. But the fact is because of the sturdiness and swiftness of the response, there is a lot less oil hitting these shores and these beaches than anybody would have anticipated, given the volume that was coming out of - the - the BP - oil - oil well. You believe it is still out there, though? Oh, absolutely. It - there is no doubt, but what we have seen is - is that the skimming, the burning, all the efforts that took place in coordination with local folks here, who often times new the landscape and new the waters better than any federal official did. As a consequence of that not only have we been able to stop the well. But we have actually seen less damage than might have occurred had we not had that kind of a response. Now, the key is to make sure that we are monitoring it carefully, based on sound science. And that it is a sustained effort over time. That is something that I am committed to. Let us talk about another topic that is part of the firmament here and everywhere. And that is the economy. The New York Times said this weekend, ENTITY has another new plan on the economy. Now would be a good time to find out about it. Do you have anything new on the economy? And while you have been away, we had a horrible GDP number last month. Well, look, we - we anticipated that the recovery was slowing. The economy is still growing, but it is not growing as fast as it needs to. I have got things right now in - before Congress that we should move immediately. And I have said so before I went on vacation, and I will keep on saying when I - now that I am back. We should be passing legislation that helps small businesses get credit, that eliminates capital gains taxes so that they have more incentive to invest right now. There are a whole host of measures we could take, no single element of which is a magic bullet but cumulatively can start continuing to build momentum for the recovery. But look, the - this was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the worst recession since the Great Depression. And so, what we know is that we are going to have to slowly, steadily build confidence. Push more investment out there. Target areas like clean energy that we know are going to be be growth areas in the future. Look at how we are doing our infrastructure, so that we can maximize the amount of jobs that are created. So, there - there are a range of steps that I hope we can get bipartisan support for. But right now, we are still - we are in the season, political season, which means that for the next two months there is going to be be constantly a contest in the minds of Members of Congress. And my Republican friends in Congress, between doing what the country needs and what they think may be advantageous in the - in terms of short term politics. Since you weighed into the Islamic Center near Ground Zero controversy, it - it is gotten larger. It is been nationalized, the debate. Will you revisit that topic? Well, look, I think my statement at the IFTAR dinner in the White House was very clear. And that is - is that if you can build a church on that site. If you can build a synagogue on that site or a Hindu Temple on that site, then we cannot treat people of the Islamic faith differently, who are Americans, who are American citizens. That is central to who we are. That is a core value of our Constitution. And my job as President is to make sure in part that we are upholding our Constitution. Respectfully, the next day in Florida, you seemed to walk that back. So - No, I - actually, let - let me be clear, Brian. I did not walk it back at all. The - what I said was I was not endorsing any particular project. I was endorsing our Constitution. And what is right. Now, the media, I think - anticipating that this was going to be be a firestorm politically - seemed to think that somehow there was inconsistency and there was not . And I was very specific to my team and will be very specific to you now. That the core value and principle that every American is treated the same. That does not change. I mean, think about it - I - at this IFTAR dinner I had - Muslim Americans who had been in uniform fighting in Iraq. Some of whom have served over 20 years. How - how can you say to them that somehow their religious faith is less worthy of respect under our Constitution and our system of government? You know, that is - that is something that I feel very strongly about. I respect the feelings on the other side. And I would defend their right to express them just as fiercely. ENTITY, you are an American born Christian. And yet, increasing and now significant numbers of Americans in polls, upwards of a fifth of respondents are claiming you are neither. A fifth of the people, just about, believe you are a Muslim. Keep in mind, those two things - American born and Muslim - are not the same. So - but I understand your point. Either or the latter, and the most recent number is the latter. This has to be troubling to you. This is, of course, all new territory for an American President. Well, look, the - the facts are the facts, right? So, we went through some of this during the campaign. You know, there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation, that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly. We dealt with this when I was first running for the U.S. Senate. We dealt with it when we were first running for the Presidency. There were those who said I could not win as U.S. Senator because I had a funny name. And people would be too unfamiliar with it. And yet, we ended up winning that Senate seat in Illinois because I trusted in the American people's capacity to get beyond all this nonsense and focus on is this somebody who cares about me and cares about my family and has a vision for the future? And so, I will always put my money on the American people. And I am not going to be worrying too much about whatever rumors are floating on - out there. If I spend all my time chasing after that then I would not get much done. Even a number as sizeable as this - what does it say to you? Does it say anything about your communications or the effectiveness of your opponents to - Well, look, Brian, I - I would say that I cannot spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead. It - it is what - the facts are the facts. And so, it is not something that I can I think spend all my time worrying about. And I do not think the American people want me to spend all my time worrying about it. What does it say to you that Glenn Beck was able to draw a crowd of perhaps north of 300,000 people on the anniversary of Dr. King's speech, on the site of Dr. King's speech? Message appeared to be, at times, anti-government, anti-spread of government. Anti-Obama administration. And in favor of - I guess - re-injecting God into both politics and the American discourse. Well, I have to say, I - I did not watch the rally. I think that one of the wonderful things about this country is that at any given moment any group of people can decide, you know, We want to - our voices heard. And - and so, I think that Mr. Beck and the rest of those folks were exercising their rights under our Constitution exactly as they should. I - I do think that it is important for us to recognize that right now, the country's going through a very difficult time, as a consequence of years of neglect in a whole range of areas. Our schools not working the way they need to, so we have slipped in terms of the number of college graduates, you know? A financial system that was not, you know, operating in a way that maintained integrity and assured that the people who were investing or who were buying a home or were using a credit card were not getting in some way cheated. We had a health care system that was broken and that was bankrupting families and businesses. All those issues are big, tough, difficult issues. And those are just our domestic issues. That is before we get to policy issues in two wars. And a continuing battle against terrorists who want to do us harm. So, given all those anxieties - and given the fact that, you know, in none of these situations are you going to be fix things overnight. It is not surprising that somebody like a Mr. Beck is able to stir up a certain portion of the country. That is been true throughout our history. What I am focused on is making sure that the decisions we are making now are going to be be not good for the nightly news. Not good even necessarily for the next election. But are good for the next generation. And I am very confident that those decisions are the ones that we have made. As you note it ties into an economy in down times. Do you have a message for the disenchanted? The angry? The angry who are unemployed and feeling victimized by this economy? Well, look, I think they have every right to be frustrated. And they have every right to be angry. And I think the message that I will continue to deliver in the months ahead and the years ahead is it took us a long time to get into this hole that we are in. This was the worst economic crisis that we have seen in generations. And we are making progress. We are steadily moving forward. A year ago today, we were still losing jobs, we are now gaining them. The economy was still contracting, it is not expanding. It is not happening as fast as people would like. But it is moving in the right direction. And the thing we cannot do is to try to go back to the same policies that created this mess in the first place. Now, part of the - I think the balance that we are going to be have to strike is the fact that, you know, we have got huge debt, huge deficits that amounted as a consequence of this financial crisis. A consequence of this incredibly deep recession. And that means that we are going to be have to do two things at once. We have got to keep on pushing to grow the economy. But we have also on the medium term and the long term have to get control of our deficit. And it would be ideal where we did not have to worry about one and could just focus on the other. But, you know, this generation, it is fallen on our shoulders to make some very tough decisions. The one thing I guess I would say to the American people is that we have been through tougher times before. And we always come out ahead. As long as we stay united. As long as we stay optimistic about the future. As long as we stay innovative. As long as we work hard and we apply ourselves. We have still got the best universities, the best workers, the best business climate of any economy in the world. And so, I have no doubt that we are going to be rebound and rebound strong. But when you are in the middle of it. And if you do not have a job right now. It is - it is a tough, tough situation. Finally, sir, because I see fidgeting - on Iraq. You are speaking on that subject this coming week. We watched the last of the combat troops leave live on on television. Our own Richard Engel wrote along with them. The end of Operation Iraqi Freedom. What would it take to send combat troops back in? A real and present threat to the 50,000 or so that remain in the so-called noncombat role would General Ordierno have to call you and say, We need more firepower back here. There were what? Fourteen coordinated bombings on one day. You know, Brian, I am not going to be speculate on what scenarios might occur. Here is what I know. The trend lines have been steadily declining violence. Even after we left the cities. What you have seen is lower and lower levels of violence. The Iraqi Security Forces are functioning at least as well if not better than any of us had anticipated. And there is great confidence on the part of the commanders on the ground. That even though you are going to be see some efforts at any given time for remnants of A.Q.I. and terrorist organizations to try to stir things up. That in fact you are not going to be see the kind of sectarian war break out in Iraq that had occurred. That does not mean that it is going to be be smooth sailing from here on out. That is why we have still got a training operation there. That is why we are going to be continue to conduct joint counterterrorism operations. That is why we have got to make sure that we have the troops there to protect our civilians who are really taking over the lead there. But the bottom line is - is that we have been able to successfully transition and turn over sovereignty and security operations to the Iraqis. Their job right now is to make sure that they get a government completed. And they are going through a political process that is natural in a fledgling democracy. But we are confident that that will get done. And that we are going to be be a long term partner within Iraq. But we are not going to be be operating in the same combat role that we have in the past. And finally, I am hoping to find you in a reflective mood on a cloudy day. We are the first to speak to you coming off your summer vacation. How does it recharge you? What do you think about? What do you see? What do you read about? How are you thinking about your job these days? You know, we went through the last two years of as intense a set of problems as I think any President's faced in a very long time. And I can look back and say we got some really tough stuff done that needed to get done. And as I look forward, my central focus is going to be be to make sure that I am constantly communicating with all segments of this country about why I feel optimistic about our future. You know, one of the - one of the actual great things about America as I was doing some - some - historical reading, during the break is we kind of go through these periods during difficult times where we think we are falling behind. You know, nothing's going right. We do a lot of soul searching. And then usually we come out of that funk and it is precisely because we do some self reflection. And we ask tough questions. And we have these contentious debates. And there is - you know - a lot of folks who have very strong opinions about various issues. That process helps guide us in a better direction. That is part of the reason why this is a more dynamic society than others. This is one that is adaptable. That can change. That can recover. That is resilient. And, you know, the one thing that I have never felt more confident about is that America will continue to lead the world, will continue to be resilient. And we are going to be just have to make sure that we stay steady and do not lose heart as we transition into a better future. And that means we are going to be have to make some tough choices now. But you know, we should - you know, we should constantly have our eye on - on that longer term price. What are you thinking about your jobs these days? Well, you know, I think that the first couple of years were, as I have said, about getting some very hard things done and contentious things done, but that needed to be done. I think the next couple of years, we have got to focus on debt and deficits. We have got to focus on making sure that we make the recovery stronger. And a lot of that is attracting private investment. Making sure that these companies who are making good profits are actually seeing the opportunities out there in a whole range of new areas and new ventures. So, there was a lot more implementation, management - probably less of the constant legislative functions that we had. But I - I am confident that both things are necessary. Both things are important. Enough work remaining to seek a second term out of. Well, you know, the - I - I am not spending a lot of time thinking about a second term. Right now, I am spending a lot of time thinking about what I got to do next week.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithbrianwilliamsnbcnightlynews", "title": "Barack Obama Interview With Brian Williams on NBC Nightly News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-brian-williams-nbc-nightly-news", "publication_date": "29-08-2010", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 432, "text": "ENTITY, when Donald Trump spoke to his convention, he talked about the security threat. He talked he painted a very dark picture. Now there is been a terrorist attack in Germany. Right. Does not that suggest he is right about the darkness? No, it does not . Terrorism is a real threat. And nobody knows that better than me. I have been spending most of my days over the last seven-and-a- half years coordinating our intelligence, our military, our diplomatic efforts to crush organizations like al Qaeda and now ISIL. It is going to be an ongoing threat for some time. But what we have been able to do, I think, is to build coalitions with other countries to make sure that, rather than have 180,000 troops overseas fighting a non-state actor, that we have got special forces and intelligence assets and local partners, and ISIL is being defeated in Syria and Iraq. But we are going to have circumstances in which small cells, individuals are going to be able to do some harm to innocent people. And we have got to do everything we can to prevent it. One of the best ways of preventing it is making sure that we do not divide our own country, that we do not succumb to fear, that we do not sacrifice our values, and that we send a very strong signal to the world and to every American citizen that we are in this together. Explain how we would sacrifice our values specifically by being divided. Well, look, if we start engaging in the kinds of proposals that we have heard from Mr. Trump or some of his surrogates, like Mr. Gingrich, where we start suggesting that we would apply religious tests to who could come in here, that we are screening Muslim-Americans differently than we would others, then we are betraying that very thing that makes America exceptional and that, by the way, has helped to insulate us from some of the worst, you know, patterns of terrorist attacks, because the Muslim-American here community here feels deeply American and deeply committed to upholding the rule of law and working with law enforcement and rejecting intolerance and extremism that is represented by the perversions of Islam that ISIL is sending out to the Internet or carrying out in the Middle East. But that requires leaders, political leaders, religious leaders, business leaders, all of us, to send a very clear signal that we are not going to be divided in that fashion. And I think the kinds of rhetoric that we have heard too often from Mr. Trump and others is ultimately helping to do ISIL's work for us. He was the chief birther in America, questioning whether you what is it what is your reaction to fact that he is the nominee of the Republican Party? Well, I think it says something about what is happened to the Republican Party over the course of the last eight, 10, 15 years. If you think about what a Bob Dole or a Jim Baker or a Howard Baker or a Dick Lugar or a Colin Powell stood for, now, they were conservative. They were concerned about limited government and balancing budgets and making sure we had a strong defense, but they also understood that our system of government requires compromise, that Democrats were not the enemy, that the way our government works requires us to listen to each other. And that is not the kind of politics that we have seen practiced, I think, all too often. Do you think the majority of the American people feel safe, that the world is safer after Well, I think, right now, we have gone through a really tough month, and that happens sometimes. We have had a terrorist attack in Orlando, although it does not appear externally motivated, but a deranged man killing scores of people. You have had the tragedies that happened in Minnesota and Baton Rouge, police officers targeted both in Dallas and Baton Rouge, and the senseless violence that took place in Nice. And if that is what you are consuming, that is what you are seeing on a day-to-day basis for the last month, I think it is understandable that people are concerned. What I think is important for leaders to do is to let the American people know they are right to be concerned. We have got to make sure that our police officers are protected in a very tough job, that our criminal justice system operates the way it should and without bias, that we are doing everything we can to go after terrorists. But it is also important for the American people to remember that our crime rate in this country is much lower than it was in the '80s or the '90s or when I first took office, that immigration rates are substantially lower than they were when Ronald Reagan was president, that, as serious as these terrorist attacks are, the fact of the matter is, is that the American people are significantly more safe now than they were before all the work that we have done since 9/11. And so maintaining that perspective, I think, is absolutely critical, and trying to fan fears simply to score political points, I think, is not in the best interests of the American people. You had a very strong reaction to Donald Trump's criticism of you for not using the phrase radical Islam. But, in 2008, when you were a candidate for president, you did use the term radical Islam. Why did you stop? You know, this is an interesting example of where something that should not be an issue gets magnified. The fact of the matter is, is that I have never been politically or particularly concerned with the phrase. What I have been more concerned about is, how do we stop violent extremists from killing us? The reason that I have not used the particular phrase radical Islam on a regular basis is because, in talking to Muslim allies, in talking to the Muslim-American community here, that was being heard as if we were ascribing to crazy groups like ISIL or al Qaeda the mantle of Islam. And since we need them as allies, I think it is useful for us to listen to how the president of the United States' words and messages are being received, because, if we are going to defeat those organizations, we need help from the billion-plus Muslims in this world, so that they can help root out this perversion of Islam that is taking place. Speaking of allies, Donald Trump had a response and a view about NATO. He said, if one the Baltic nations were attacked, that he might not defend unless they were paying their dues. Now, you have talked about free-riders Yes. countries that rely on U.S. defense without pulling their share. So, why are not those similar thoughts, if not playing out a little differently, but it is the same thought? Well, I think that anybody who has been paying attention knows there is a big difference between challenging our European allies to keep up their defense spending, particularly at a time when Russia has been more aggressive, and saying to them, you know what, we might not abide by the central tenet of the most important alliance in the history of the world, one that was built by Democrats and Republicans and has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II. And for Mr. Trump, who has in the past suggested that America is weak and not looking out for its allies, to then maybe not have enough information or understanding, to go out and say that America might not stand by its solemn commitment to protect those same allies who stood with us after 9/11 when we were attacked, I think, is an indication of the lack of preparedness that he is been displaying when it comes to foreign policy. Switching topics to talk about race in America, you wrote a book about race and identity in America. If you were a young man now growing up in America, how would that book be different? Well, you know, it is a great question. In some ways, I am able to see it through the eyes of my daughters. Now, obviously, they have got a unique circumstance, having grown up in the White House. So, they are in no way typical of black kids or Latino kids, or other ethnic minorities around the country. But, in some ways, I would be more optimistic. I look at the way in which my daughters take for granted their right to aspire to anything. And I think about the way, in their interactions with their white friends, they have a common culture and a common language and common perspectives that were far more segregated even when I was growing up, and that was not that long ago. So, in a lot of ways, I would feel more hopeful. Ironically, I think precisely because things have gotten better, what I have heard from younger African-Americans is more shock about the images and the videos from Minnesota or Baton Rouge. And what I have had to say to them is that, you know, these issues are not new. They have been there and come up periodically for quite some time. What is new is smartphones and videos. And this actually gives us a greater opportunity to try to tackle these problems. ENTITY discusses his relationship with Hillary Clinton when we come back. I want to talk to you about the skills that it takes to be president. Yes. In about 72 hours recently, you had to grieve in Dallas with the families of the five police officers, you had to monitor a terrorist attack in Nice, you also had to monitor a coup attempt and then what people are calling a purge in Turkey. Given that that is what a president has to deal with, what attributes should we be looking for in the candidates who are running for president to handle those kinds of days? Well, let us start off with the fact that I am biased. Sure. Right? But you are a man of reason. So, you will be able to make the case So, I think I will try to be as objective as I can. And I have thought about this. You know, the first thing I think the American people should be looking for is somebody that can build a team and create a culture that knows how to organize and move the ball down the field. And the reason for that is, because no matter how good you are as president, you are overseeing two million people and a trillion dollar-plus budget, and the largest organization on Earth. And you cannot do it all by yourself. And so you are reliant on really talented, hardworking, skilled people, and making sure they are all moving in the same direction, and doing it without drama, and not worrying as much about who is getting credit, and creating all those good habits inside of an organization that I think are critical. The second thing I think a president needs is a sense of discipline, personal discipline, in terms of doing your homework and knowing your subject matter, and being able to stay focused, helping to make sure that the team in the White House is disciplined, because you are responding constantly to unexpected events. And you have got to be able to just work those through in rapid, effective fashion, but also not lose track of your overall goals. The third is, you need vision about where you want to take the country, and you have got to know ahead of time enough about the economy and foreign policy and American history and, you know, our system of government, so that, when you stake out a vision that we need more economic equality in this country, you are just not making assertions. You are actually able to drive policy forward to achieve the vision. And then the final thing is, you have to really care about the American people, not in the abstract, not as boilerplate, but you have to really every single day want to do your best for them, because, if you do not have that sense grounding you, you will be buffeted and blown back and forth by polls and interest groups and voices whispering in your heads, and you will lose your center of gravity. You will lose your moral compass. But if you really are here because, man, that I want the make sure that woman who is working really hard is getting paid a decent wage, I rally want that family with a sick kid to make sure they are not losing their home, then, even when things go bad and there are going to be times in this job where things go bad you have a frame of reference. You know why you are doing it. And that means also that you can push through and do some things that may not be politically popular initially. In 2008, a lot of your supporters said, look at the way he ran his campaign. If he runs the presidency like his campaign, he is going to be in good shape. Why is not that true for Donald Trump, who has run a pretty remarkable campaign, beating 16 other politicians? Well, in 2008, I do not think they were referring merely to the fact that I had won. I think they were referring to the fact that we built a really good team. We were really well-organized. We were we had a great culture that that there was no whiff of scandal to how we approached getting elected. We told the truth. So, there were a bunch of things that hopefully showed the kind of White House I would run. And I think we have been pretty consistent in doing that. I do think that the body of work of a person matters. And I would say that and I have said this before I will say again, since you opened this line of questioning I generally believe that there has never been a candidate better prepared for the presidency than Hillary Clinton. Not Eisenhower, not George Herbert Walker Bush? Those were pretty Well, I said more prepared. I did not say that they were, you know, chopped liver. I mean, you know, heading up the Allied forces is pretty good training for the presidency. And I am huge admirers of both Eisenhower and Herbert Walker Bush. In fact, I think that George H.W. Bush is one of the most underrated presidents we have had. I think he was and is a really good man. But the skill sets that Hillary has are similar to many of the skill sets that they had, experience in government, experience in working with a wide range of people, solving big, difficult problems, familiarity with the world. You know, the truth is, is that Hillary and I have become friends, but we are not bosom buddies. We do not go vacationing together. I think that I have got a pretty clear-eyed sense of both her strengths and her weaknesses. And what I would say would be that this is somebody who knows as much about domestic and foreign policy as anybody, is tough as nails, is motivated by what is best for America and ordinary people, understands that, in this democracy that we have, things do not always happen as fast as we'd like, and it requires compromise and grinding it out. She is not always flashy, and there are better speechmakers, but she knows her stuff. And more than anything, that is what is ultimately required to do a good job in this office. You built a team at the beginning. And you were really clear about transparency. Yes. You were going to change the White House and the Yes. to be transparent Right. to send a message to the country, who felt let down by people. Right. She set up an email server that was neither in the spirt or the letter of that transparency. That is no small thing based on what you told everybody about transparency at the beginning? Right. And I and I think that she would acknowledge she made a mistake. But what I also think is true is is that if you have been in the public eye for decades at the highest levels of scrutiny, folks are going to find some mistakes you make. I have made mistakes. I do not know any president or public official at her level who are not going to look back and say I should have done something like that differently. But what I would also say is that the consistency with which she has devoted her life to trying to make sure that kids get health care and a good education, and that, you know, families are getting a fair break if they are working hard and that America upholds its best traditions of foreign policy, on the big stuff, she is gotten it right. But if you make mistakes, you have got to admit them quick and be come clean. Well You you said that about the your the Reverend Wright. You gave you said afterwards, you said, you know what, we learned, you have got to get this done and you have got to Yes. Ultimately, government is a human enterprise. You know, none of us are perfect. And this job, by definition, leader of the free world, the president of the United States of America, the the most powerful country and wealthiest country and most influential country in the history of the world, it is a big job. And it it has gotten more and more complicated and the speed and the pace at which you are moving is different. And if you think about now that we know our history, about the errors of even our greatest presidents, of FDR or JFK or Ronald Reagan or Harry Truman, then what you realize is that ultimately, each of us who occupy this office, including me, are going to, in some ways, in some areas, fall short of the ideal. And I promise you, if you occupy this job long enough, you are you are acutely aware of it. You are you are painfully aware. And there are not there is not a day where I do not say to myself I wish I could have done this just a little better. I I wish I could explain to the American people this issue just a a little bit more effectively. I wish that I had some perfect scheme that could bring about an end to the the crisis of Syria quicker so that be because I am seeing the consequences of events that are unfolding all around the world. But what keeps you going is the fact that you are doing your best, that you you are re- you have put together a team of people that could not be working harder or be smarter or more effective and what you also know is is that, at the end of the day, our democracy works because it is not reliant just on one person, but it is a it is a process of self-government where we are all involved in making things a little bit better. FDR and Lincoln were both talented at letting both sides of an issue think that they agreed with both of them. Is honesty overrated as a presidential quality? It is interesting. I actually think that honesty is not overrated. I think it is absolutely necessary, because the trust you have with the American people is a currency that can get depleted and it is hard to build back up. What I also believe, though, is that the issues we deal with are so complicated and trying to move all the pieces together to to move this huge ocean liner that is the U.S. government means that sometimes holding your tongue, sometimes letting things play themselves out, knowing not just when to act, but also to when to hold back and and see how things are playing out so that you can pick and choose the time to do what needs to be done, because the moment may not be right yet. You know, those those things, I think, are a matter of feel. You know, Lincoln and FDR were masters at it. You know, I am not in in their league, but hopefully, after seven and a half years, I have gotten a little better at it. What is the one piece of advice that you are predecessor gave you that worked, that was really useful? Well, first of all, George W. Bush, despite, you know, obviously, very different political philosophies, is a is a really good man and and has been very gracious to me, and Laura has been gracious to Michelle and the whole family has been terrific. Probably two useful pieces of of advice. The first piece of advice was trust yourself. And know that ultimately, regardless of the day to day news cycles and the noise, that the American people need their president to succeed, regardless of political party, which I thought was very generous of him. The second piece of advice is always use Purell hand sanitizer, because if you do not , you are going to get a lot of a lot of colds, because you are shocking a lot of hands. And news you can use. Absolutely. Thanks, ENTITY. Thanks. I enjoyed it. We also visited the Oval Office while we were at the White House Friday. That is coming up. During our visit to the Oval Office, the president gave us his thoughts about leaving office. So you are ready to you are ready to go when it is time. Yes. I you know, one of the things that I have I have come to realize is the wisdom of George Washington and the founders that, you know, for the health of our democracy, having some turnover, having some fresh legs come in, having are really important. I feel as if I am a better president than I have ever been, that the experience has made me sharper, clearer about how to get stuff done. My team is operating at a a peak level and, you know, we we are really proud of what we are going to do and we are going to run through the tape, but I also think it is really important for self-governance and democracy that we go through this this process and I am able to turn over the keys. Do you walk in here and think like, OK, another day is gone off the calendar, the days are dwindling Yes. that we have got to we have got to move fast, because time is passing? There is a strong sense of urgency and I have no doubt that on the last day, as I am , you know, leaving this office for the final time, that there is going to be some melancholy and nostalgia, particularly about the people that I have I have worked with here. But frankly, on a day to day basis, you are so busy you do not have a lot of time for that kind of reflection. I think that comes after you are you are gone. On the last day, what are you going to do? Are you going to go look at the Remington? Are you going to look at the hopper? What are you going to what, for you, in this room, is The Emancipation Proclamation is no longer here Yes, that is not that is not here any longer. I will tell you that I will probably look at the carpet, because I still remember, it took us a couple of years to actually get the thing in. We did not want to remodel in the middle of a recession, even though that is the tradition. But I still remember thinking about those quotes that we were quoting from Teddy Roosevelt and JFK and Martin Luther King and you know, I will probably wonder whether whether I did everything I could to stay true to those quotes. And, hopefully, I will be able to say yes. Do you feel that is true? In the Martin Luther King quote, which you I believe was in your acceptance speech on election night Yes. in Chicago. Yes. Is that quote true? Yes. even remind Yes. people what that quote is. Well, the that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. And I believe that it does. One of the things I always tell my staff is that, you know, we are here for such a short time in history. And we never are going to get done everything we believe should get done. In that sense, we are relay runners. And we do our part. We run a good race. But even during this eight year period, this eight year stretch, which, in human history, is the blink of an eye, 20 million people have health insurance that do not that did not have it before. And same-sex couples can get married in all 50 states. You know, families who saw their loved ones struck down on 9/11 know that justice was delivered to bin Laden. Companies and families are a little more financially secure because we did not go into a great re- a depression. And, you know, the accumulation of work that we have done moved the needle. It did not revolutionize the country, but it bent that arc. And, you know, my job is to make sure that when I leave this place, America is a little bit better off and it will be up to the next person to continue that process and I will have a role to play as citizen in making sure that that arc keeps bending toward justice, because it does not do it on its own. And we will be right back with our political panel.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjohndickersoncbssfacethenation", "title": "Interview with John Dickerson of CBS's Face the Nation", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-john-dickerson-cbss-face-the-nation", "publication_date": "24-07-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 156, "text": "Thank you, sir, ENTITY. The United States and Japan recently signed a document on the transformation of U.S.-Japan alliance, and the realignment of U.S. and Japanese forces in Japan. But there is a strong local opposition to some of these plans. For example, the local government in Okinawa has called this relocation of Futenma Marine Air Corps- Air Station unacceptable. Since these plans for relocation have implication for a broader transformation plan of your country, how will you overcome this local, strong opposition to the implementation of the agreement, and more generally, what would you like to achieve in the Asia-Pacific region through the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance? The fact that we reached an agreement on troop realignment shows the maturity of our relationship. As you know, the agreement that has been reached was done so in good faith between the U.S. Government and the Japanese Government. It is an agreement that was not easy to bring to conclusion, but yet, nevertheless, because our relationship is strong and vital, we are able to do so. In a democracy, it is hard-first of all, it is hard to satisfy all the people all the time. And so-I am aware that there is a discontent with the agreement expressed by the folks-some of the folks on Okinawa toward the Government-the Japanese Government that negotiated the deal. My attitude is and my message to the good people in Okinawa is: This is a good-faith effort. We tried to reach an accord that accommodated a lot of interests. And it is a positive development. Secondly, the relationship-it shows the-how strong we are, as an alliance, as a friendship. This has been a difficult issue, and in that it got resolved, it should be a sign to people on both sides of this issue that there is a cordial, frank, relationship that was able to deal with this sensitive subject. U.S.-Japan relations are important for our respective countries. We are trading partners; we are partners in peace. And I want to congratulate and thank the people of Japan for helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy. We worked in strong collaboration on a variety of issues, whether it be helping Afghanistan or whether it be to tackle disease around the world. So this is a healthy relationship, and it is good for peace, and it is good for prosperity of our peoples. Yes, ENTITY. I'd like to also ask about the relationship between United States and South Korea. Do you have any specific plans for the strengthening of the alliance, and to improve the relationship between the United States and South Korea? In that context, what do you also think of the growing anti-American sentiments in South Korea? Well, first of all, the trip will help strengthen the alliance. Any time I can sit down with a leader and discuss common opportunities and common problems, that strengthens the relationship. Secondly, we have shown the people in South Korea that we are able to, again, deal with the complex issue of military bases in a way that is thoughtful and sensitive. As you know, we are realigning our forces and realigning our bases. The Government is a duly elected Government of the people. It tends to reflect the will-they reflect the will of the people and this relationship, and the realigning of the forces reflects the will of the people. And it is being done in a respectful way. That should strengthen the relationship. As well, I want to congratulate the Government and thank the Government of South Korea for the support in democracy in Iraq. People there-the Government there has helped the people in Iraq see a way forward by providing security forces there. I appreciate that very much. Ours is a very important relationship, and it is one that-one that is able to accomplish important things, such as working together to make sure that we have fair trade. And I will bring that up, of course, with We do not have a free trade agreement yet with South Korea, but nevertheless, we have got a lot of trade with South Korea, and we want it to be mutually beneficial. And the more beneficial trade is between our countries, the deeper our ties become. I do not study public opinion polls in South Korea, so I do not know the basis for the last part of your question. But I mean, I made some difficult decisions, and I understand not everybody agrees with them. But one of the things I hope people do agree with in South Korea is that the United States-they have got a strong friend in the United States. We have been a friend for a long period of time, and we will remain a friend. Mr. Wang. China-U.S. Relations Thank you, ENTITY. You are going to visit China for a third time since 2001. As we know, the relationship between two countries have made considerable headway since you took office. Now it is your second term in office. How do you assess the relations between China and the United States at this moment? And how do you anticipate relations in the coming years? I would say my personal relationship with President Hu is very good. I would say relations between the United States is mixed-or between China and the United States is mixed. On the one hand, we have got increasing trade and dialog and cooperation. On the other hand, there is still work to be done on intellectual property rights, for example, or currency or market access. And so ours is a complex and important relationship. And I look forward to visiting once again with the President and talking to him about these very vital issues. I was very pleased the last time we met in New York that he openly stated that we need- that China will work hard on having intellectual property rights. And this is not just an issue between the United States and China. It is really an issue that when China cracks down and enforces intellectual property rights laws, that it will be good for China's standing in the world. People really do not want to do business in a country if they think their products is going to be- if the patents will be copied. And so I appreciate the President's strong statement on intellectual property rights, and it will be a chance to continue to talk about intellectual property rights. I appreciate the Government's position on currency as they begin-the beginnings of a market-based currency. And that was a strong step forward. I will remind him that this Government believes they should continue to advance toward market-based evaluation of their currency, for the sake of the world, not just for the sake of bilateral relations. There is a-I want to tell him that there is a-that we-again, what we have discussed in the past, that there is -the trade balance between China and the United States is bothersome to people here and that we have got to address the trade balance. And one way to do so is for there to be market access for U.S. products, continued market access for U.S. products. So we have got an important relationship, and it is a good relationship. But it is one in which I will continue to bring the- our concerns to the Chinese Government. Okay, ENTITY, thank you. It seems the relationship between Japan and China is currently at an all-time low. We have heard criticism, concern voiced by China about Prime Minister Koizumi's recent visit to Yasukuni Shrine. This is, ENTITY, historically, a sensitive issue between the two countries. As poor relations between Japan and China have a significant impact on U.S. national interests in Asia, I suppose, what can the United States do to address the worsening relationship between the two countries- I mean, Japan and China-and how would you like to rebuild U.S., Japan, and China relations as a part of your comprehensive diplomacy towards Asia? What I can do is to urge the leaders of not only China and Japan to dialog and to try to get the past behind them as we move forward but also to do the same with the South Korean leader. I think the issue that you described goes beyond just Japanese-Chinese relationships; it is probably Japanese-South Korean relationships as well. And my point to not only the Prime Minister of Japan but to the respective Presidents is that, look, I understand that there is great tension as a result of some events that took place in the past. But the United States and China-I mean, the United States and Japan at one time were sworn enemies. And now here we are sitting down as friends. In other words, it is possible to forget the past. It is difficult, but it is possible. So I think a useful role for me will be to paint a-talk about the future and talk about how optimistic the future can be, particularly as nations are able to work out past differences and focus on what is -and focus on the future. No question that there is tension. On the other hand, if you look at capital flows between Japan and China, there is a significant amount of investment taking place, which indicates to me that there is a possibility for the relations to improve over time. In other words, not all aspects of the relationship is negative. Thank you, ENTITY. You probably were going to ask the same question, were not you? I would like to ask about North Korean issue. That is fine, but I thought you were going to ask about the shrine. ENTITY, you have called Mr. Kim Chong-il, North Korean leader- Kim Chong-il's regime a tyranny and North Korea an axis of evil. What can you do to promote human rights and democracy in North Korea? And what kind of leadership do you expect from Kim Chong-il to exercise as the leader of North Korea? I have been-I have expressed my concerns about the treatment of men, women, and children in North Korea. I worry about a society that is going hungry. I worry about forced labor camps. And I do so-and as I do worry about that, I do so because I am, like many Americans, a compassionate-share a compassion for all peoples, regardless of where they live. I believe a-the measure, the mark of a good leader is one that cares first and foremost about the human condition of the people that live in the country. And where there is starvation and hunger, the leader's responsibility is to address that and, if need be, call upon others to make sure that food and aid actually get into the mouths of the hungry. I believe that a humane society is one in which people have a voice in government. And so I have talked about these values. But I have also talked about them in the context of say, Myanmar. I have warned about the undermining of those values in other parts of the world. It is a consistent message of my administration. As you know, the main focus of the region is to adhere to the Crawford Declaration that President Jiang Zemin and I stated in Crawford, which was that there would be a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. And now we are working to achieve that goal- working together-Japan, China, South Korea, Russia, and the United States sitting down at the table with the North Koreans as a group, saying, Here is our goal: For the sake of peace for all peoples, peoples of South Korea, people of North Korea, people in the region, let us achieve the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula- nuclear-weapons-free Korean Peninsula. And so we will be discussing this issue, of course. I will be discussing it with the respective leaders about how to achieve that goal. We have made some progress where we declared that it is our intention to work with the North Koreans to see to it that they dismantle their nuclear weapons programs in a verifiable fashion. And so the dialog will continue on as to how to achieve this noble goal. Yes, sir. Taiwan My second question is about Taiwan. The Chinese people are determined about peaceful reunification with the motherland, but the secessionist force in Taiwan have never stopped their activities, causing a threat to peace and stability Cross Strait. What do you think the United States can do in preventing the secessionist forces in Taiwan from moving toward independence, while maintaining peace and stability in the region? Well, one thing the United States can do is be consistent in its policy in dealing with the-both China and Taiwan. And so our policy has been consistent from day one, which is one China, three communiques, that we do not support independence, and that, however, we strongly support the Taiwan Relations Act. And it is important for parties to understand that is the position-that is the consistent position of this Government, that we also believe and are heartened when we see dialog beginning to take place between China and Taiwan. That is a positive development, and I will continue to encourage that dialog. Yes, ENTITY. One more round of questions. Thank you very much, sir. Then you probably have to go back to work. Okay. So do I. Let us move to the six-party talks again. Yes. A little bit more in detail. Okay. Actually, the next round of six-party talks beginning tomorrow in Beijing, so this is previous-the six-party talks. And now as of today, of course, the United States and Japan have demanded that North Korea take tangible steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. But North Korea, on the other hand, every day-almost every day-is insisting that the United States company provide it with light water reactors. So, ENTITY, there is obviously still a sizeable gap between North Korea's position and that of other five parties-- Yes. --including Japan and the United States. So, ENTITY, what would you like to see achieved during the next round, and what do you think are the most important steps in attaining those goals? Yes, thank you. Well, first of all, you are right, there is a meeting starting, I guess, this week, but it is a 3-day meeting which is really to prepare for the longer meetings, which will take place next month. Secondly, you have assessed our position. It is not the United States' position, but our position-the five parties that are working with North Korea to achieve the goal of having a nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, and that is that-and that is that we want to see tangible results in the dismantling of a program, and at the appropriate time we will discuss the light water reactor. That is how we interpret the agreement. So part of the reason to go on a trip like this is to remind people about the strategy and talk it out with leaders and friends and remind them that we will stick together and hopefully achieve this noble goal. Again, it is a goal vital to all the interests of the people in the region. And it is one that I believe we can achieve by working together. And this is the-there is a certain degree of patience required when it comes to negotiating a difficult issue. And there is clearly a need for us to continue to dialog amongst ourselves, to make sure that we send a consistent message in order to achieve this goal. It is in people's interest. It is definitely in the interest of the people in the region that there not be a nuclear weapon anywhere on the Peninsula. It is definitely in Japan's interest; I strongly believe it is in China's interest. I know it is in Russia's, and for that matter, it is in the U.S. interest. Even though we are seemingly removed, it is in our national security interest that we achieve this objective. So this is a very important subject, and I look forward to continuing to dialog with our partners in peace. Thank you, ENTITY. Make this a good one, because it is your last question. What kind of new role do you expect United States troops in Northeast Asia, including South Korea, to do in the future? And what are you going to deal with their critical issues, such as strategic flexibility of the United States forces in Korea and the transporting wartime operational control from the United States forces to Korea? The first part of your question, the role of U.S. troops is to provide stability. Obviously, there is-on the Korean Peninsula, North Korea has got troops massed on the DMZ. Part of the role and the relationship with the South Korean troops is to provide stability to the people in the Korean Peninsula. Now, as you know, we are repositioning our troops and realigning bases, but we have done so in a way, as we have worked out with President Roh in such a way as not to diminish the capacity to provide stability. And secondly, the presence of troops helps provide regional stability. The arrangement we have on the Korean Peninsula has worked for a long period of time. And that ought to be the operative model as we go forward. China and the United States have enjoyed good cooperation in various areas, including fighting terrorism, democratic relation, and the nuclear issues of Korean Peninsula. And a shared interest between the two countries have increased over time. So what is your comment in this regard, and where do you think we could expand our cooperation further, say, in what areas? Well, first of all, we do have good cooperation. We trade a lot- that is cooperation. On the other hand, we just want to make sure-and both sides feel that it is important to have a level playing field when it comes to trade. Advancing the Doha round is an area where we can cooperate together. The avian flu area is an area where we can cooperate together. And I did have a very good discussion with President Hu about this in New York. And I will bring it up again, because I am concerned about a pandemic. And I am not suggesting it is going to break out in any country; but if it were to break out anywhere in the world, it becomes an international issue. In other words, I am not saying just because I am talking to President Hu that I think it is going to happen in China. All I am saying is that if it happens anywhere, China and the United States, Japan and South Korea, ASEAN countries, APEC countries, everyone is going to have to work together to identify, contain and respond to an outbreak. So this is an important area. We work together in the war on terror. There is a variety of ways that we can continue to advance an agenda that is based upon peace. And then, again, this is a complex relationship, as I said. And it is an area, for example, where I will continue to remind President Hu about, for example, my personal faith and the belief that people should be allowed to worship freely. And a vibrant, whole society is one that recognizes that certain freedoms are inherent and need to be part of a complete society. And he is made some very positive statements and interesting statements about different aspects of freedom. So this is a vital relationship. China is a vast, significant, growing economy that is-using more and more energy. And here is an area where all of us can work together, and that is on how to share technologies and use technologies in such a way that we become less dependent on hydrocarbons. Certainly, Japan has an interest in this in that she imports a lot of hydrocarbons. South Korean Peninsula, same thing-or South Korea, same thing-and China. The United States uses a lot of hydrocarbons, and it is in our interest that we develop technologies so that we use less. It is in China's interest as well. So energy cooperation, the idea of discussing how to best move forward and to share technologies makes a lot of sense for our respective people and the world for that matter. And so it is a-we have got great opportunities to work together. I am really looking forward to going to the three countries represented here. Every time I go out to the Far East, I come back appreciative of the notion of hard work and entrepreneurship and culture. So I am looking forward to the trip. It is going to be-it'll be an important trip. Thank you all for your time. Very good questions, appreciate it. Thank you all.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-0", "publication_date": "08-11-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 112, "text": "Well, ENTITY, how is your strategy partnership with India is going to shape up during the forthcoming visit? Well, first of all, our strategic partnership had a great start, or a great impetus, when your Prime Minister came to visit here in Washington. We had a wonderful visit. And one of the important things about diplomacy is to get to know your counterpart. And I got to know the Prime Minister and admire him as really a decent fellow who is smart and capable. And this visit will help foster not only the personal relationship, though, but a strategic partnership that is growing all the time. And it is one that is very important for the American people and, I think, the people of India. This relationship between the United States and India can produce good results for our people but also will enable us to achieve some international objectives as well. Well, in the context of excellent bilateral relations, which you have just mentioned, I think, what is your take on the civilian nuclear program? Well, it is a tough issue. It is a tough issue for the Prime Minister; I understand that, and it is a tough issue for me. I knew it was going to be a hard issue, because we have to convince-both of us have to convince our respective people it is in the interest to have a civilian nuclear program supported by the United States and India, as well as a civilian nuclear program that is separate from a military program in India. And I understood the politics was going to be difficult, and there is still work to be done. We have just got to continue to come up with an agreement that both of us can live with. But the relationship is broader than just the civilian nuclear issue. I have told the American people, we want India to develop a civilian nuclear power program. We are all, kind of, connected globally, particularly when it comes to the price of energy. And the more nuclear power used by great emerging democracies and economies like India, the better off we will all be. Well, there is an impression, as reflected in the U.S. media, that you are surrendering your interests while proposing to supply civilian nuclear technology to India. What do you tell them? Well, I tell them it is in the interests of the world that India have a nuclear power industry. On the other hand, it is also very important for India to understand our concerns about making sure that there is a-that a civilian program is separate from the military, and there is the IAEA safeguards. And again, we are breaking some new ground. I am not surprised that it is difficult to reach a consensus. And we will keep trying and working at it. The key thing is, though, that the people of India understand that our relationship is a vital relationship. And it is vital on a variety of fronts. It is vital when it comes to commerce and trade and prosperity; it is vital on fighting the war on terror. I mean, the people of India know what terror is all about; you have been hit before. And it is vital on working together to achieve a more peaceful world. And so I am really looking forward to this trip. It is going to be exciting for us. I think the-terrorism is one area- a joint working group has been working excellently, even before the unfortunate incident of 9/11, between India and U.S. But the terrorist training camps and training infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir has not been totally dismantled. How about a-and from the Pak-Afghan border, sir, also, troops are being-your troops are being targeted. So how-- Well, listen, I understand the war on terror is universal, and it is very important for all of us to work together to stop the advance and the goals of these terrorists. And you bring up Pakistan; it is an interesting moment in our relationships with each other. It used to be that if America were close to Pakistan, then the Indian Government-- Yes, that zero-sum game, that is over. It was zero-sum. And now I think President Musharraf understands that it is important for me to have a good relationship with India and vice versa. Prime Minister Singh understands. And we do have a good relationship with both. But on my trip to Pakistan, I will of course talk about the terrorist activities, the need to dismantle terrorist training camps and to protect innocent life, because one of the real dangers of the terrorist movement is that they will kill innocent people to achieve an objective. And India and President Musharraf, as well as our country, cares deeply about innocent life. We respect human life. Now about trade and commerce, which we are mentioning. Well, in your Asia Society speech-I attended; I heard it, was a spectacular speech you made. Thank you. So you talked about this Indian middle class, the 300 million, which is bigger than U.S. It is. Growing, emerging market and all that. But still, India right now contributes only 1.3 percent of your global export. Right. So what is the roadmap? Well, the roadmap is to continue to work for openness, opening markets on both sides. Listen, trade, again, this is an issue that takes time to develop. Our relationship is a growing relationship, and we are constantly addressing needs to make sure that markets are open. We are going to have a business CEO forum with India CEOs and American CEOs that will brief us on what more we can do together. And we are democracies. I mean, India is a great democracy. And democracies, there is constant pressure against certain advances. People have their opinion, and people are allowed to express their opinion. And opening markets is difficult. It is difficult for a lot of countries, and it is not easy for America, either. But the purpose of the trip is to continue to work to open up markets because opening markets and free trade that is fair trade will benefit workers and families on both sides of the trading equation. Well, military-to-military relationship is again another success story, new heights. It is-every day it is reaching new heights. Yes. Marrying of technologies and understanding each other-and what about the same kind of cooperation in the field of defense industry? In what now? In defense industry, joint production with India, America, technology transfer. Well, as you know, there is a lot of technology transfer. And I quoted the example of Texas Instruments having a plant in India's silicon valley, a research center, and that is a classic case of technological transfer. Knowledge is technology, is the advancement of technology. And listen, this country has greatly benefited by Indian Americans, and Indians that have- with advanced degrees and degrees that have-unbelievably smart-engineering and different aspects of science and technology. And we welcome the presence of Indian students here in America, as well as the great contribution of our Indian Americans. But technology transfers oftentimes require knowledge transfers, and one of the things about the relationship that has emerged is the fact there is a lot of knowledge transfer between private sectors and through research institutions, and that is positive. Well, the last question-this is your first visit to India. It is. While preparing to visit India and political negotiations, have you discussed with Mrs. Bush how to negotiate hot Indian curry? Well, I am going to have to-I will have to try that on. I will tell you afterwards. My one regret is that I am not going to go see the Taj Mahal. And that is not the fault of the Indian Government; that is the fault of the George W. Bush schedulers. And obviously, it goes to show sometimes ENTITY does not get all his wishes. But I am really looking forward to going to the country. I am looking forward to meeting members of the Government. I am looking forward to having private time with the Prime Minister. And I know Laura joins me in telling the Indian people, thanks for friendship, and we cannot wait to come to your country. Thank you very much. And welcome to India, you and Mrs. Bush. And I think there will be many more visits after this. I hope so. Thank you, sir.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdoordarshanindia", "title": "Interview With Doordarshan of India", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-doordarshan-india", "publication_date": "24-02-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 48, "text": "Do you believe the Iranians are trying to develop nuclear weapons? All the evidence indicates that the Iranians are trying to develop the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. They might decide, once they had that capacity, that they'd hold off right at the edge in order not to incur more sanctions. But if they have got nuclear-weapons-building capacity and they are flouting international resolutions, that creates huge destabilizing effects in the region and will trigger an arms race in the Middle East that is bad for U.S. national security but is also bad for the entire world. Sanctions have been tried before. It only seems to bolster the Iranian regime. What makes you think they will work this time? And if they do not work this time, what is the alternative? Well, I think the idea here is to keep on turning up the pressure. The regime has become more isolated since I came into office. Part of the reason that we reached out to them was to say, You have got a path. You can take a path that allows you to rejoin the international community, or you can take a path of developing nuclear-weapons capacity that further isolates you. And now we are seeing them further isolated. Over time, that is going to have an effect on their economy. Now, you know, I have said before that we do not take any options off the table, and we are going to continue to ratchet up the pressure and examine how they respond. But we are going to do so with a unified international community that puts us in a much stronger position. I want to talk about health care; polls still coming out saying the American people are not on board -- A whole week after it passed. -- in significant numbers. Yeah. Health care was declared dead a bunch of different times over the last 14 months or so. Besides the efficacy of why you thought it was important to pass it, what made you think you could get it done? Well, because it is the right thing to do. Look, when I am -- But there plenty around you, even people within that building, who said, Let us do it piecemeal. Let us do it one piece at a time. The one thing I do not do, Harry, is to think short term based on day-to-day polls. I look at what does the country need long term. And what we know is that insurance rates in the individual market are going up 30, 40 percent for people if they do not work for big companies. Small businesses are getting killed. We know that Medicare and Medicaid costs are unsustainable. And so my attitude was that if I did not make an effort now to change how we deliver health care, this country was going to go bankrupt. I will ask you the question -- why you thought you could do it. Why I thought I could do it? Yeah. Because I have confidence that if you have good policy and you are trying to do the right thing, that over time the politics works its way out. . . . I have been spending time out and about, listening to talk radio. Right. The kindest of terms you are sometimes referred to out in America is a socialist, the worst of which I have heard is called a Nazi. Are you aware of the level of enmity that crosses the airwaves and that people have made part of their daily conversation about you? Well, I mean, I think that when you listen to Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck, it is -- It is beyond that. it is pretty apparent. And it is troublesome. But, you know, keep in mind that there have been periods in American history where this kind of -- this kind of vitriol comes out. It happens often when you have got an economy that is making people more anxious and people are feeling as if there is a lot of change that needs to take place. But that is not the vast majority of Americans. The truth is, some of these comments, when you actually ask, Well, this is based on what? -- this notion that Obama's a socialist, for example -- nobody can really give you a good answer, much less when they, you know, make -- They would say mandating that people have to buy insurance or something like that. Yeah, the sort of plan proposed by current Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Yeah. So it does not make too much sense. It used to be that somebody who said something crazy, they might be saying it to their next-door neighbor or it might be on some late-night AM station at the very end of the radio dial. Very last question: Does it bother you? You know, the -- you end up getting a pretty thick skin in this job. And obviously when you have gone through a presidential campaign, there are a lot of things that are said that thicken your skin. I am concerned about a political climate in which the other side is demonized. I am concerned about it when Democrats do it. I am concerned about it when Republicans do it. I do think that there is a tone and tenor that needs to change, where we can disagree without being disagreeable or making wild accusations about the other side. And I think that is what most Americans would like to see as well.< Well, as we have reported, Harry Smith spent some time with President Obama at the White House yesterday. Harry asked Mr. Obama what was behind his surprise decision this week to open large new areas of the U.S. coastline to oil drilling. There are going to be areas 150 miles out, 100 miles out, where it is sensible for us to allow for exploration, not because it solves our problem. We cannot drill out of our problem, and I said this -- During the campaign. during the campaign. But we are going to need to make sure that we have got some additional production in order to assure that we can transition into a clean-energy economy.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithharrysmithcbssearlyshow", "title": "Interview With Harry Smith on CBS's Early Show", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-harry-smith-cbss-early-show", "publication_date": "01-04-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 506, "text": "Prime Minister Vajpayee said that you will conclude, now that you are here, that the situation Kashmir, between India and Pakistan is not as bad as they say it is. Is that what you conclude? Well, I think that I have concluded that he is going to do everything he can to avoid having it escalate into a war with Pakistan. And that is encouraging. But I still think it is a difficult situation, to say the least. I think it is important that they both show restraint. I think it is important that they respect the Line of Control, both sides do. And then, over the long run, I think what really matters, in terms of an ultimate resolution, is that the people of Kashmir feel that their legitimate interests are being addressed in some formal fashion. But I do feel better about his determination to avoid a war, at least what you might call a full-scale war. But I do not I am still very troubled by the fact there is so much violence there. A lot of it obviously is propagated beyond the borders of Kashmir, and I do not think the Line of Control is adequately respected. And I think you know, what happened at Kargil was very troubling to me, because I supported strongly the dialog between India and Pakistan in the Lahore process. I still think it is a difficult situation, and I do not think they should take it lightly, either side. Moreover, Prime Minister Vajpayee is much more militant with the Indian press than he was with you today. That is good, though. That means that maybe that means my trip here has a beneficial impact. And I hope I can have some impact on the Pakistanis when I go there. What do you mean by impact, ENTITY? You know, I spent last July 4th trying to persuade former Prime Minister Sharif to withdraw back behind the Line of Control. He did. I think it weakened him when he did, frankly, but it was the right thing to do. I think that they these countries need to be thinking about reducing violence and increasing cooperation and dialog and freeing up their immensely talented people for different pursuits. If you look at how well the Indians and the Pakistani-Americans have done, how well they are doing in the information economy in the United States, how well they are beginning to do here, it is truly a tragedy that they are basically trapped in this position which, even if it does not lead to war, leads to big expenses on defense, which could be spent on education and health care or the development of a modern economy. So I hope that my trip here and the longterm rekindling of the relationship with India that I am committed to for our country can basically, slowly, over time, take this in a different direction. Forgive me for being more pointed. You know as well as I do that you are talking, to a very large extent, in generalities. What do you think the United States can really do here, especially given the fact that the Indians say the United States has no role? Well, I think that what they say is that we have no role in Kashmir. And they have every right to say that. Every place in the world I have been involved in the peace process you know, it is because we have been able to inspire the confidence and have a relationship with both parties. But I think the United States does have an interest in trying to avert a larger conflict and trying to reduce the tensions between the two countries. I think we do have a clear interest there. So? We have worked with the Pakistanis for years. We want it and obviously we have got a big interest in India's future. So therefore, I think anything I can do to get them to focus on what it would take to reduce the tensions is important. And I think right now the important thing is respecting the Line of Control, reducing violence, and find a way to resume the dialog. Now, beyond that, it is up to them. You will tell the Pakistanis they should respect the Line of Control, the de facto cease-fire line? Absolutely. And what will you tell those Kashmiris, or Pakistanis, who believe they are fighting to free the Muslim Kashmiris from Indian control? First of all, I think that the same thing I said to the Indians. I do not think there can be a military solution to Kashmir. And the tangled history of it does not admit of a simple solution. I think that the best chance that the Pakistanis have, if they want to have a positive impact on what they believe the legitimate concerns of people who live in that part of Kashmir that is in India, is through a dialog, not through acts of violence and supporting acts of violence. And I think for many years they thought that might get us involved, and it will not . I am not going to be dragged into something that first of all, that India does not want us to be part of and, secondly, that I got dragged into from deliberate acts of violence. I just do not think that is right. So what is America's Kashmir policy? Our policy is: First, respect the Line of Control; second, do not promote violence by third parties in Kashmir; third, negotiate; and fourth, with respect to India, that there is not a military solution to Kashmir's problems by India, either, that the Kashmiris deserve to have their own concerns addressed on the merits. But I do not think we ought to get in the position of saying that we think that an ethnically diverse country like India cannot exist anymore. I do not agree with that. Do you support the Kashmiris' right to a referendum on their own independence? Do you support the right as it was laid out by the United Nations in 1948, for them to have a plebiscite on their future? Well, there is been a lot of changes since 1948, including what happened in 1971 and a number of things since. What I support is I support some process by which the Kashmiris' legitimate grievances are addressed, and I support respecting the Line of Control. And I think the Pakistanis and the Indians have to have some way of talking about it. And the Indians have to have some way of talking to their own Kashmiris about it that recognizes there is not a military solution. But the most I can do right now is to oppose violence, particularly oppose violence propagated by third parties within Kashmir, and to support reaffirming the Line of Control. And Prime Minister Vajpayee just said today that if the Pakistanis would reaffirm the principles of the Lahore Declaration and not promote or support violence on the other side of the Line of Control and respect the Line of Control, that he thought a dialog could be resumed. I think that is the best hope, ultimately, for resolving this. Who are these third parties you are referring to, involved in Kashmir? Well, we know that there have been instances of violence within Kashmir that were propagated by people who were not from there, but they were not necessarily elements of the Pakistani Government. I do not want to accuse Pakistan of something it did not do. Do you believe the Pakistan Intelligence Service facilitates the infiltration of fighters to Kashmir? I believe that there are elements within the Pakistani Government that have supported those who engaged in violence in Kashmir. And what will you tell General Musharraf about that? Just exactly what I said to you. And I want to talk with him, as I did with Prime Minister Vajpayee, about the future. I think that in order to get out of a fix when you get into a fix like this and you feel paralyzed by your past practices, the only way to change it is to have a vision of the future which convinces you that if you want to achieve a certain goal, you have got to do it in a different way. And I will do my best to persuade him of that. I just do not think that this is the way to deal with Kashmir, and I do not think it is a good enough reason to drive, in effect, the whole existence, the whole policy of the Pakistani Government. The Pakistanis are great people, too. They have been good allies of ours. They have helped us even in my time, since the end of the cold war, to get terrorists, the terrorists involved one involved in the World Trade Center, one involved in the CIA killing. They have helped us in other contexts. I want to continue to be a good ally for them. But I think they have to have a plan for restoring democracy, and they have to have a nonviolent plan for resolving their differences with India. Just so I understand, then, ENTITY, you want the United States on the sidelines in this, giving advice but not involved in any three-way attempt to settle the Kashmir issue? I do not think the United States can be involved in a three-way attempt to settle the Kashmir issue, unless and until they both want us. I think that that is the evidence you know, if you look at, we are in the Middle East because they both want us, not to say that either side agrees with everything I say and do, but we have a certain credibility there born of years and years and years of labor and a welcoming into the process. The same thing is true in the Irish peace process. So I think that right now what I need to do is to try to convince both sides to avoid the worst and there is something to be said for avoiding the worst here and then to adopt some common principles which will allow the resumption of the dialog. If we can get them to renounce violence as a way of resolving this and to restore their dialog, respect the Line of Control so the dialog can be restored, then who knows what will happen and what they decide to do and how they decide to do it. But if they stay sort of hunkered down in unapproachable positions, then I think we will have to work very hard to avoid a more difficult situation. I have a nuclear question. The United States tells people in the rest of the world to be like us. And the Indians say, Right. We are just like you. We are a democracy. We are a free-market economy, and we have nuclear weapons in order to protect our national security. What is wrong with that? Well, what is wrong with it is that we are trying to lead the world away from nuclear power and away from the threat of nuclear war. And when the Indians took this position, they basically said, We do not think we can be secure without nuclear weapons, and it is our right as a great nation to have them. And we, first of all, do not believe it does; we do not believe it enhances their security. We think countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, South Korea, that walked away from the prospect of nuclear programs, are more secure and have more funds to support their own national security and the development of their people and their economy. And we believe that it sends a bad signal when a great democracy like India, in effect, is telling the world that we ought to get into another arms race. I have tried to reduce the arms of the United States. I hope this year we will make another effort to reduce the arms of the United States and the arms of Russia. I have tried to support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the restriction of the distribution of fissile material. So I think India it sounds great to say, Well, the United States has nuclear weapons, and they are a democracy. We ought to. But if you look at the whole history of this thing, what they are saying is, We want to reverse the move toward reducing the nuclear threat because we say we ought to have nuclear weapons. Well, they also say, sir, that these are weapons of self-esteem and this is a U.S. Self-esteem, that is right. If they are weapons of self-esteem for India, then every nation in the entire world has the same right to self-esteem. So therefore, however many countries there are in the world, everyone that can afford one ought to have a nuclear weapon. I do not believe that that would make the world safer. I believe that that would make the world more dangerous. So I respect what the Indians say. They say, Look, it is not just Pakistan. China has nuclear weapons. You know, it was not so many decades ago we had a border war with China. We have our problems there. But I think that most people believe and have studied this believe that all nations would be more secure if we reduce the overall nuclear threat and reduce the number of people that had access to nuclear weapons. And also keep in mind, the more nuclear weapons you have, the more nuclear material you have, the more risk you have that that nuclear material will be subject to pilfering. So you have to worry about not only about other states becoming nuclear states but even terrorists getting ahold of small-scale nuclear weapons. I just think that it takes the world in the wrong direction. It is an honest disagreement we have with the Indians. Yes, because the Indians say to you, You Americans say well, you just do not trust us That is not true. It is okay for you, but you do not trust us. No, that is not true. Actually, I do trust them. I believe Prime Minister Vajpayee when he says, I will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. So it is not a question of trust. What I do not agree with is that a country needs nuclear weapons to manifest its esteem or its national greatness. Nor do I agree that India is actually more secure with these nuclear weapons. I think that in some ways it reduces one's security. Trust the Pakistanis with control of nuclear weapons, too? I feel the same way about them. I think they probably think they have a better argument since they know they could not win a conventional war with India, because India is so much bigger and because Lahore, for example, one of the most important places, is so close to the Indian border. But it just seems to me again, if you look at if you ask yourself, where is there greater security? In Brazil, in Argentina, or even in South Africa, or even in South Korea, where they renounced nuclear weapons? Are those people less secure than the people of Pakistan and India? I think you would have to say they are not less secure. So my argument is, any country can say to us, any country, particularly another democracy, Oh, you are a hypocrite. You have got nuclear weapons. You do not want us to have any. Well, I am trying to reduce the store of nuclear weapons the United States has, the store Russia has. The Russians have supported this. And we are trying to make the world more stable. I just think I do not think they are more secure by having nuclear weapons. On the subject of security, I am really curious. You travel all the time in this extraordinarily tight security envelope. And yet, it was not secure enough yesterday to go to a small village in Bangladesh. Did you really feel a personal risk in Bangladesh? Did you end up telling Chelsea, or, if you talked to her, ENTITY, I am going off on a trip in which I am at personal risk ? Well, I think it is better for me not to discuss it, except to say this. Insofar as there was a risk, it had nothing to do with the Bangladeshis, nothing to do with the Government or the people of Bangladesh, and they were not in any way at fault. I did my best to take account of the analysis of our security people and to act accordingly, and it worked out just fine. We had a wonderful trip. ENTITY's Security Do you ever have your way with the security people? Do you mean, do I ever disagree with them? No. Do you ever have your way? What do you mean? In other ways, do you ever have your you can disagree with them; do you ever prevail? Sometimes I do. I have from time to time disagreed with them and actually done what I wanted to do. But when that happens, I try to do it the way they want to do it, because if I disagree with them, I realize I have assumed a greater risk, and I should do it in the way they want to do it. Last question, sir. You are going to see President Asad in Geneva on Sunday. That is a pretty big meeting. Does this mean a deal is close? I would not say that. But I will say this. Ever since they met in Shepherdstown the first of the year, and then the talks sort of were stalled, I have been working very hard with both sides. I now think I am in a position to have a sense of what it will take for both sides to get an agreement. So it is an appropriate time for me to discuss this with President Asad, in the hope that we can start the talks again. I am encouraged by the decisions that have been made by the Israelis and the Palestinians. I think they are committed to going forward, and they have a pretty good timetable. They are going to have to work hard to make it. And I think that the only way we will ever have this thing the way it ought to be in the Middle East is to finish with the Syrians and then with the Lebanese, as well. So I think this is time. Whether it will lead to a breakthrough, I do not know. I hope it will lead to a resumption of talks. Is it safe to assume that President Asad does not leave the country easily and would not agree to go to Geneva to see you were you not to have something pretty good to offer? I think it is safe to assume that I would not waste his time, either. I think that we have it is time for us to talk about what we think it would take to resume these talks and move to a resolution. And I am going to give him my honest opinion about where we are and where I think we can go. And then we just need to make a decision, all of us, about whether to go forward. But principally, it is a decision for the Israelis and the Syrians. Does this involve a comprehensive settlement, one that involves the Syrian Golan Heights, the Israelis, and the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon? Well, I want to talk to President Asad. There is not an agreement, yet. But if there is an agreement, I would hope it would lead to a resolution of both the Syrian issues and the Lebanese issues, which is very important in Israel. The Israelis care a lot about that, and well they should. And of course, the Lebanese do. We will see. Keep your fingers crossed You are enthusiastic. I am hopeful.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpeterjenningsabcsworldnewstonightnewdelhi", "title": "Interview With Peter Jennings of ABC's World News Tonight in New Delhi", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-peter-jennings-abcs-world-news-tonight-new-delhi", "publication_date": "21-03-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 522, "text": "First of all, I want to thank all of you for coming today and for offering all of us this opportunity to have a conversation with the radio listeners around the country and beyond. I thought I would open just by saying that I have sent a letter this afternoon to Senator Mitchell in the Senate about some potential amendments to the defense appropriation bill and one actual amendment dealing with Bosnia, Haiti, and the whole command and control apparatus of our military as it relates to cooperation with other countries in peacekeeping and other endeavors. That amendment has actually been introduced. The letter essentially says that I oppose the amendment that affects the way our military people do their business, working with NATO and other military allies. I think it unduly gets into the details of the command and control operations of the military, which I think is an error, and that I would oppose any amendments with regard to Haiti and Bosnia that were of questionable constitutionality and unduly restricted the ability of the ENTITY to make foreign policy, and outlines some of my concerns. In Haiti, my concerns are that there should be no restrictions that would undermine the ability of the ENTITY to protect the Americans on Haiti, that would aggravate the likelihood of another mass exodus of Haitians, or that would send a green light to the people who think they have got the best of both worlds: they got the sanctions lifted, and then they broke their word on the Governors Island Agreement. With regard to Bosnia, the amendment simply points out that the United States has very strong NATO allies and that there were strict conditions that I have put on any kind of cooperation in Bosnia with NATO to enforce a peace agreement and that I think most Members of Congress agree with those conditions, but I do not think we should have an amendment which would tie the ENTITY's hands and make us unable to fulfill our NATO commitments, thus raising all kinds of questions about the longterm relationship of the United States to Europe. So that is what the letter says. There is only one amendment so far that has been offered, and we are discussing with various Members of Congress other proposed amendments. We will just have to see what happens. But I thought I ought to say clearly today that I would strenuously oppose such attempts to encroach on the ENTITY's foreign policy powers. Thank you, ENTITY. Your opening statement raises the question of whether the United States would be willing to use military force for the purpose of removing the military leadership from Haiti and reinstalling ENTITY Jean-Bertrand Aristide in power. Let me tell you what I have done today on Haiti, first of all. I just signed the Executive order freezing the assets of any people who are supporting the military and police leaders who have continued to fight the resumption of democracy and who are responsible for the bad things that have happened down there in the last few days. I have also, with the authorization of the Haitian government, directed our ships in the area to move closer to the shore so they will be in plain sight. And that has been done today. I think we should continue to work with ENTITY Aristide and with Prime Minister Malval. They want to go back to the sanctions. Remember, once the sanctions were tough, and they included oil, they produced the Governors Island Agreement. And what happened is that people who have an economic stranglehold on Haiti got what they wanted with Aristide's request, that is, lifting the sanctions. They got the amnesty that Aristide promised, they thought he would never give. And then, when time came for them to deliver what they agreed to do, they did not do it. So I think the appropriate position for us to take at this time is to go back to those sanctions and make them as tough as possible and enforce them as completely as possible. And that is what the Prime Minister wants us to do and what ENTITY Aristide has asked us to do. I think it would be an error for me to discuss what further steps might or might not be taken. After all, we do have I will say again, we have 1,000 Americans there, and we have another 9,000 people with dual citizenship, and we'd have no way of knowing what will or will not happen. But what the Haitians want is for the conditions of legitimacy to be maintained and restored. That is, the Haitian people have expressed their desires; two-thirds of them voted for ENTITY Aristide. And in terms of the questions that have been raised again in recent days about whether he could or could not govern the country, that is why he worked so hard with our support to get Mr. Malval, who plainly can run the government, as one of the ablest people in the nation to be the Prime Minister so they'd have the kind of partnership that would work. So I feel comfortable that they are capable of working with their friends and allies in the area to bring about a more democratic and a more prosperous Haiti if given the chance. ENTITY, economists are expressing some concern of late about your health care reform plan and about whether it might grow considerably larger than you envision. What assurances can you give the American public that it either will not grow out of control or that the need for universal health care is worth it ballooning to the size of, say, Medicare and Medicaid, which are 10 times larger than originally predicted? First of all, let me say that it is not a Government program. The Government will only insure the unemployed uninsured. Two-thirds of the funding for this program will come from employers and the employees who do not presently contribute anything to the American health care system. Secondly, where have these economists been for the last 15 years? I mean, the American health care system is already 40 percent more expensive than any other one in the world and the only advanced health care system in the world that cannot seem to figure out how to provide coverage to everybody while spending 40 percent more than anybody else spends. The budget we just passed in this Government has Medicare and Medicaid going up at 3 times the rate of inflation. We proposed to reduce that in our bill. We have also ceilings on how much health care expenditures can increase in any given year if the competition does not cut the costs. Now, if you look around the country at the places which have tried serious efforts at managed competition, including bringing the Medicaid program into a competitive arena, there is every indication that the rate of increase will slow down and that it will work. But the economists, they seem to want it all ways. They criticize me on the one hand for having a ceiling on how much costs could increase in any given year and then saying we do not have any guarantees, if you take it off they will not increase more. And it is difficult to imagine how we could design a system that would have costs more out of control than the one we have. I mean, the reason we have so much support here from employers in heavy industry, for example, who already cover their employees is that they are being killed by the cost increases. The system we have is irresponsible and out of control financially, and does not provide health care security to Americans. So we think there are plenty of protections built in to slow the rate of increase in costs. In fact, if anything, I think we have been certainly realistic and then some, in estimating how fast we can slow costs down. That is, even under our plan, it is estimated that the percent of our income going to health care will go from about 14.5 to about 18 by the end of the decade, and that if we just stay with the system we have got, which is the alternative in all these things, you have got to ask what is the alternative we will go from 14.5 to 19 to 20 by the end of the decade. We have allowed and budgeted for significant increased expenses in health care. ENTITY, in the past week or so you and your foreign policy team have come in for some pretty blistering criticism, especially from a group of prominent Republicans. Richard Lugar, Dick Cheney, Dan Quayle, James Baker, and Robert Dole have all been very, very critical of your foreign policy. And some members of your administration have suggested that is politically motivated, these people might be running for President. What do you make of it, and how do you react to those criticisms? I think you can monitor their travel schedules and statements as well as I can. I do not have anything to say about that. I am going to do my job as best I can. I am going to try to support a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. I am going to try to involve Republicans and Democrats in the process of consultation and getting as good advice as I can all the way along. And I think that you have to expect that when things go very well, as they did with Russia and the Middle East, people will say you are doing fine, and if difficulties arise, then some will say that you did not do fine. So I just do not want to get into the politics of it. If you want to talk about any specific policy in any specific country, I will do my best to answer that. But I think it serves no useful purpose for me to engage any of them in this sort of debate. Whatever the political motivations are, I have a contract that runs for a specific amount of time. I am going to do the very best I can during that time, and then when the time is up the American people can make their own judgments. I have not even been ENTITY a year. I do not have any interest in starting a political debate now. Even though it is been less than a year, ENTITY, it is been a very ambitious Presidency with a lot of projects you have taken on yourself, health care reform, reinventing Government, national service, things you inherited like Somalia, Haiti in a way, NAFTA. Is there ever coming a point, is there now a point that you just have to say, enough is enough for now, the plate is too full, we have to resolve some of these things before we get on with other things? Oh, sure. And we have taken that position. I mean, first of all, if you go back to the budget, we kept the budget front and center until that was resolved. And it plainly has worked rather well. Long-term interest rates are still below 6 percent. The budget did some remarkable things. It dramatically broadened the availability of college loans to students, and it has the most significant piece of tax reform for working families in 20 years by increasing the earned-income tax credit, so that all working families on modest incomes with children will know they will be lifted above the Federal poverty lines. That is a lot to accomplish in a year right there. The national service bill passed, and very well, and of course, a number of other pieces of legislation have. And now, what we are going to focus on between now and the end of the year is making as much headway as we can on the first round of reinventing Government cuts, on the crime bill, on the political reform initiatives that some of which have passed the Senate already, the campaign finance reform and lobby reform bill, and on getting the health care bill heard and setting schedules there so we will know that it will be reviewed along with all other ideas in a prompt and timely fashion, and we will be able to see as we wind up here a process which unfolds next year and brings us to a datecertain vote. But we do have a lot going. We probably had more done this year than in any given first year in a long time, and there is still a lot more to do. For example, we started our welfare reform task force hearings around the country, but I do not intend to offer any legislation on that until next year. And there will be a lot of other things that will come up as we go along next year. We want, for example, to change the whole unemployment system, as you know, to a reemployment system. We do not think that will be offered until next year, to give the American people a system of lifetime education and training. I do hope that we can pass as many bills as possible this year. I was heartened by the fact that the House passed our education reform bill, the Goals 2000 bill, with such a big bipartisan majority last week, which made me think we could probably pass that bill completely before the Congress goes home the end of the year. ENTITY, it is coming up on 2 years since the end of the Soviet Union and the declaration by the remaining states to call themselves democracies or create democracies. Secretary Christopher is headed over there. Can you tell us what the objective of his trip is? Will he be looking to set up a summit meeting? Well, there is a possibility, of course, that President Yeltsin and I will meet again early next year; I have to go to Europe to the NATO summit. But primarily, what he wants to do is to convey the continuing support of the United States for democracy and reform in Russia, to urge the Yeltsin administration on in their efforts to complete the timetable to get a new constitution and to have legislative elections and to restore completely the conditions of democracy in Russia, and to review the progress on the Russian aid package, both the ones, the two passed by the United States Congress here with strong bipartisan support and the international package that came out of the G-7 summit. And so he will be doing all those things. And I am sure they will review some of the difficulties in that part of the world, too. President Yeltsin also has his share of foreign policy problems that he cannot fully solve. But we will talk about that. We are interested very much in some of those things. Especially we'd like to see the last Russian troops withdrawn from Latvia and Estonia, as they have been from Lithuania. ENTITY, if we could return to the Haiti issue for just a moment. Senator Dole said he did not think it was worth any American lives to restore ENTITY Aristide. You indicated you did not want to go too far into options. But are there conditions beyond, say, a direct physical threat to the U.S. Embassy compound in Port-au-Prince under which you would consider committing U.S. troops to Haiti? For example, attacks or killings of foreigners, a flow of refugees, or maybe just threats against foreigners? Are there any conditions for sending U.S. troops? I just think at this time it is better for me not to rule in or out options. Keep in mind, the Haitian Government, as we speak, has not asked for that and does not want that. And keep in mind that the sanctions did work once before to get this agreement, which was not honored perhaps because we raised the sanctions, we lifted the sanctions. But let me remind you that the circumstances of this need to be focused on. Haiti is very much in our backyard. The people wanted democracy. There is the continuing issue of whether there would be another exodus of Haitians trying to come to the United States, something which I think is not in their interest or ours but is something that the present conditions could make more likely. And we do have those Americans there. So what I want to do today is to encourage Prime Minister Malval and the brave people who are in his government and the good people of Haiti who plainly want democracy and are being pushed around by the only guys in town with guns, which I regret very much. But we are trying to preserve the legitimacy of democracy there. Now, the truth is, as you know, there are people in this country, in the press, and in the Congress and elsewhere, who, notwithstanding the vote of the Haitian people, basically have never felt very strongly about returning Aristide anyway and have questioned his fitness to be ENTITY You can do that with the winner of any election. But all I can tell you is that I would just like to observe just a couple of things. Number one is, unlike his adversaries, ENTITY Aristide has done everything he said he would do under the Governors Island Agreement, including giving them amnesty. And secondly, recognizing his lack of experience in politics and business, he reached out to a man like Malval, who is plainly one of the ablest people in the country and clearly a very stable and reassuring figure, asking him to run the government. So I feel that we should support the democratic movement in Haiti. And I think that the steps we are taking now are the appropriate ones. ENTITY, have you decided on a nominee for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights? I do not want to give you an evasive answer, but let me tell you what happened. We had, weeks ago, a nominee who declined the position for personal reasons. And the Justice Department was asked, the Attorney General specifically was asked, to make another recommendation. I believe that she has a recommendation for me which I have not yet formally received. But I am not positive of that, but I believe so. ENTITY, I'd like to ask you about a subject that you have brought up in a number of your remarks lately. You have been discussing the issue of gun control, firearms violence, the extremely high cost of health care related to firearm injuries. Senator Chafee of Rhode Island has once again introduced legislation which is pending in the Judiciary Committee now which would ban the sale, manufacture, possession, importation, or exportation of all handguns with exceptions for law enforcement, military, and licensed target clubs. You have talked about your support for the Brady bill and for a ban on assault weapons. How would you feel about Senator Chafee's bill, which I understand Dr. Sullivan, former HHS Secretary, is testifying on tomorrow? Well, I have to read it, but I think it might go a little far if it bans all handguns, just because I think that there is a lot of evidence that Americans have used handguns responsibly for sporting purposes, that they are not all used as weapons for committing crimes or killing people. I do believe, however and let me say first secondly, as a practical matter, I have not yet been able to get Congress to vote on the crime bill, including the Brady bill and the vote to ban a comprehensive list of assault weapons. I also know that I heard that Senator Kohl has an amendment, which I would encourage, which would make national the ban on ownership or possession of handguns by minors unless with their parents or another supervising adult in an appropriate setting, which might be the way to go on the issue that Senator Chafee is concerned about. Nonetheless, I hold him in the highest regard. He is , I think, an extremely responsible person, and I welcome the hearings on his legislation. But I would have a little problem with a total ban on handguns. I would have a problem with that based on what my understanding of the situation is. Again, we ought to focus on the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, and banning possession by minors right now. Since I have been working on this in the last several months, one of the multitude of statistics that is made the biggest impression on me is the one that we were told a couple of weeks ago, that now someone shot in a criminal encounter is 3 times more likely to die from a gunshot wound because they are likely to have nearly three bullets in them, as opposed to only 15 years ago. That is a huge statistical change. And of course, as I pointed out, these wounds and the homicides put an enormous financial burden on this country, on the medical system, on the criminal justice system. But mostly, it is an incredible human problem. We have got 90,000 people in the last 4 years murdered in America, most of them by gunshots. That is more in any single year than were ever lost in a single year in the war in Vietnam. I think the time has come to do something about this. And I am hopeful that both Houses of Congress will act on the crime bill and on the assault weapons bill before the end of the year. I hate to keep coming back to this, but right now I do not know that we have the votes to pass the assault weapons ban in the Congress. And I hope we can get the votes to do that and to pass the limitation on minors and possession or ownership of handguns. I think if we push those now in the Brady bill, then the Congress could really make a dent on the exposure of Americans to lethal violence. ENTITY, could I go back to your comments about the use of American military force and your discussions with Congress? Would you oppose, would you veto legislation which contained an amendment requiring you to ask and get the consent of Congress before you use troops in Haiti or Bosnia? And how far do you think the congressional role in the war powers area goes? Well, let me say, my letter says that I want to resist and that I urge the Senate not to vote for things which unduly infringe on the ENTITY's power, and certainly not things that are of questionable constitutionality. Before I express an opinion about a veto, I need to see a specific piece of legislation. And there are still discussions going on about the questions of Haiti and Bosnia. The whole issue of the War Powers Resolution and the role of Congress and the role of the ENTITY obviously has been the subject of virtually nonstop debate in America for the last several years, for all kinds of obvious reasons. Sometimes Congress has acted or attempted to act to restrict the ENTITY's authority under ENTITYs Reagan and Bush, and sometimes they have. All I can tell you is that I think I have a big responsibility to try to appropriately consult with Members of Congress in both parties whenever we are in the process of making a decision which might lead to the use of force. I believe that. But I think that, clearly, the Constitution leaves the ENTITY, for good and sufficient reasons, the ultimate decisionmaking authority. And I think to cut off that authority in advance of it being made without all the circumstances and facts there before us is an error and could really lead to weakening our relationships with a lot of our allies and encouraging the very kind of conduct we want to discourage in the world. I understand what is going on here, and it is all perfectly predictable, given any reading of American history and perfectly understandable, given the aversion that Americans have always had to seeing any of our young people die when the existence of our country was not immediately at stake. And the ENTITY should be very circumspect and very careful in committing the welfare and the lives of even our All-Volunteer Army. We need to have a clear American interest there, and there needs to be clearlydefined conditions of involvement, and the burden is on the ENTITY to provide those. But still the ENTITY must make the ultimate decision, and I think it is a mistake to cut those decisions off in advance. Final question. Thank you, ENTITY. In the past week or so, ENTITY Bush himself and, as we have already discussed here today, some members of his foreign policy team have criticized your foreign policy team. I am curious about the promise that has been reported that ENTITY Bush made to you. And it is also been reported in at least one commentary, that there was an implied promise from your side to go easy on any revelations about the so-called Iraqgate scandal. What can you tell us about your discussions with Mr. Bush on this? Well, first of all, with regard to the Iraqgate issue, there was no promise expressed or implied. There was no discussion about that between me and ENTITY Bush. I believe he said publicly that he would not have anything negative to say about the administration for a year at least, that he thought we were entitled to that. And again, I just do not want to get into this. This is a free country, people have free speech, they can say whatever they want to say. I think you will agree. And maybe I have been wrong to do it, but I have been pretty careful about focusing on the problems we have in the future and not trying to spend a lot of time establishing partisan blame for the past. I said that in my State of the Union speech. I said it in the health care speech. I said it repeatedly. What is past is past. I am doing the best I can with the issues that I faced when I came here. If the time comes in the future when I have to engage in a debate with any of those folks about whodid-what-when, I will do my best to have that kind of a debate. But I just do not think it does not get us very far. And I would hope that if they have a constructive suggestion to make about what America should do, I would be more than happy to take it. I am not ashamed to ask for advice from anybody, Republicans or Democrats. I have called every living former ENTITY, I have called former Secretaries of State, I have called those that agreed and disagreed. As you know, Secretary Shultz thought that the previous administration should have done more in Bosnia, thought that we should. I mean, there are people who have Secretary Kissinger thought just the reverse. I mean, this is a new and difficult and uncertain time. But if they have anything to say about what they think we ought to do, I will be glad to listen, and I'd just ask that it be constructive when they do it. I am told by your aides that we are out of time. On behalf of the radio networks, we thank you, and we hope we can make this a regular thing. I would like to do it on a regular basis. I am a big radio listener, you know. Except if we did it enough, we could even have Top 10 countdowns in the middle and stuff. We accept the challenge.

{"id": 141, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for receiving us at the White House, just a week before your meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev. I am Claude Smadja, from the Suisse Television. Let me introduce my colleagues: Martin Bell, from the BBC; Giuseppe Lugato, from RAI; Dieter Kronzucker, from ZDF; and Jacques Abouchar, from AN-2. ENTITY, 1 week before the summit in Geneva, the prospects seem quite bleak. Do you still expect to strike a deal in Geneva, and, in fact, are you going to strike a deal in Geneva? Well, I am not as pessimistic as that. I understand, of course, that it is not going to be easy. There is a long history of meetings between our two countries and, many times, without much result. But I am going to make every effort to try and reduce the mistrust and suspicion that seems to exist between our-well, not only our two nations but sort of the East and the West. And I believe there are possibilities. We are going to try to deal in some four areas-arms control, of course, is one; the regional disputes that are going on in the world and where the major powers are involved. Bilateral issues, a number of kind, that are between us probably would be the easiest thing that we will face in those meetings. And we will just carry on, see what we can do. ENTITY, I wonder, on arms control, are you going with a set negotiating position-some counterproposals to Mr. Gorbachev's proposals-and is your team of advisers finally united behind you? Yes, we are united, and I think that there is been some distortion as to whether we were not . In our government here, I solicit and encourage varying opinions and ideas. I think it helps to make a decision when I hear all viewpoints. But I do not envision this meeting as being one where we will get down to specific numbers and so forth. We have a team of negotiators, each side, in Geneva that have been negotiating on the possibility of nuclear arms reductions for some time. We have had a proposal on the table in those talks for a considerable period of time, and finally, the Soviet Union came back with a counterproposal. And we have now offered a counter to that. We found encouragement in their counterproposal; there were numbers that we could agree with. And so, the proposal that we have made in response is one that kind of compromises between our original proposal and theirs, accepting some of their figures-in fact, some of the main figures on basic numbers and so forth-and then, our view on some of the complex issues about the mix of weapons and so forth. And to me, this is legitimate negotiations. But I would think what we should be dealing with at the summit is, as I said earlier, the elimination of suspicion and mistrust to the point that we could turn the specific numbers over to those other negotiators, but that they could have a signal from both sides, from their government and ours from us, have a knowledge that we want them to continue and to arrive at an agreement. ENTITY, over the last few days and even now here, you continue to sound optimistic about the summit in Geneva, though we know now there will be no substantial agreement, there will be no arms agenda, and even, probably, there would be no joint communique. Now, what would it be-just a get-acquaintance meeting? And in this case, even the atmosphere, I think it is a bit strange, considering the last occurrences. So, what is the reason of your optimism? Oh, no, I do not think this is just a get-acquainted meeting, important though that may be. But I think there are many areas for agreement here. And as I say, I am not pessimistic about them. Look at the one situation that has both of us continuing to build these arsenals of weapons. The Soviet Union claims that they fear that we mean harm to them, that somehow we are nursing a plan of invading them or attempting to change their system. On the other hand, we believe, and I think with some evidence, that their policy has been expansionist; that is evidenced by Afghanistan, Ethiopia, South Yemen, Angola. And I think that if we sit and face each other and lay our cards on the table as to the fact that they do not like us or our system and we do not like theirs. But we are not going to try to change theirs, and they better not try to change ours. But we have to live in the world together. And we are the only two countries that probably could start world war III. We are also the two countries that could prevent world war III from happening. And I think that a little common sense should make us find out that we can continue to be competitive in the world, but in a peaceful way and without the threat of annihilation hanging over the world as it does now. ENTITY, scientific results show up to now that your space defense shield is not as impenetrable as originally thought. Does this make SDI more of a bargaining chip? Could you compromise on this system? Not compromise in the sense of giving up on the research. Now, the truth of the matter is there've been some breakthroughs that have a number of scientists quite optimistic about this research, and since this research is all going on within the bounds of the ABM treaty, we are going to continue, because I think it would be the greatest thing in this century if we could come up with the idea that, at last, there is a defensive measure, a system against nuclear missiles. Nuclear missiles-these are the only weapons in the history of man that have not given birth, so far, to a defense against them, but this, as I say, would be the greatest thing for peace. If we could switch from a setup today in which peace is maintained on the basis that we can destroy each other, totally offensive weapons, each with a great arsenal and the threat that, well, if one starts, the other will retaliate. Does not it make much more sense if we could come up with a defensive system and then sit down with all the nuclear powers in the world and say, Look, let us get to less of an offensive nature and let us take up the idea of reassurance for ourselves on a basis of defensive systems, not offensive weapons ? And so, this is not a bargaining chip in that sense-of being willing to trade off the research and stop what we are doing in order to get x number of missiles eliminated; we will continue with that. Then, as I have said many times, I think if the research, and when the research, would show that such a weapon is practical, then, before deployment, I think we sit down together and decide how we use this to bring about the elimination of nuclear weapons, offensive weapons, and to make the world safer. ENTITY, you have described Mr. Gorbachev as a formidable opponent. Did his Paris meeting with the French President give you a new light on the Soviet leader's personality and did that change your approach of the summit in any way? Well, no, but some of our own people, now, have met with Mr. Gorbachev. Unfortunately, President Mitterrand could not be at the U.N. meeting, where I managed to meet with the heads of state of our other economic summit allies. And so, I heard secondhand, however, from some of them who had had an opportunity and then from Margaret Thatcher and then, as I say, with our own people who've met with him. I recognize all they say. On the other hand, I just told our people this morning that there will be another first in these meetings. It will be the first time we have ever had someone on our side of the table who is older than the fellow on the other side of the table. So, maybe I can help this young man with some fatherly advice. ENTITY, you have set regional conflict high on the agenda. What will be your approach to Mr. Gorbachev on this regional conflict? The substance of your talk will be enough is enough? Will it be kind of fist-on-the-table approach to Mr. Gorbachev? Well, I believe if we are going to eliminate or reduce the tensions or the mistrust between us, it is going to have to be by deeds rather than words. And I enunciated what I believe about the regional things in my speech to the United Nations, that here are these conflicts, people are being killed, such as is going on in Afghanistan. And it is true that there is a government in Afghanistan that is on the side of the Soviet Union. It also is true that the Soviet Union installed that government there; it was not chosen by the people of Afghanistan. Now, my thought is that if we can take these up as examples of the expansionism that I mentioned and see if we together, these two great powers together, cannot withdraw foreign forces and then help and perhaps get international custodial forces while they settle peacefully the dispute within each one of these regions. This is what we have been trying to do in Nicaragua, where, again, the Soviet Union is-no question-they are involved with advisers, trainers, and great amounts of weaponry, more than any Central American country needs for its own defense. So, you have to believe that they, too, are looking toward spreading beyond their borders this totalitarianism. But we have urged the contras and the Sandinista government of Nicaragua to come together, lay down their weapons, declare a truce and come together, and then, we suggested there the church overall supervise or mediate while they seek to settle their differences without further bloodshed. So far the contras have agreed. The Sandinista government is the-and so has the church-the Sandinista government has said no. But this is the type of thing that we think should be the answer to these regional problems, not only out of humanitarianism and a desire to see people be able to live peacefully in their countries but because those regional conflicts run the risk of spreading and leading to confrontation between major powers. ENTITY, Mrs. Thatcher described you last night as our champion; that is, you are going in to bat at Geneva for the Europeans as well as the Americans. Is that so, and what can you do for us? Well, I think the world is pretty much divided right now, certainly Europe and our own hemisphere here between East and West and the NATO alliance-that NATO line does seem to be a dividing line between that and the Warsaw Pact, and there is no way that I could go there and deal with the subjects before us without having in mind the best interests of our allies also, because in the event of catastrophe they are there on the front line, they would be the first to feel that. So, yes, I expect to have their interests very much in mind. Sir, this is in a way a followup on Martin Bell's question. I should say that the Europeans have a great nostalgia of detente, and what is your message to them at the eve of Geneva, and what is your vision of a new detente? Limits also? If it is a real detente, if it is based on the elimination or reduction of the suspicions that now exist-but in the past, under the guise of detente, we saw the Soviet Union engage in the greatest military buildup in world history and at the same time that we were supposed to be talking as if we had friendly relations and had achieved some kind of a detente. And what was really, finally, going on was an arms race, because when they achieved an imbalance so great that we felt our own security was threatened, we had to get into the arms race. I have often told of a cartoon that appeared in one of our papers when we started our refurbishing of our military power. And it was a cartoon of two Soviet generals, and one was saying to the other, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. And I know that Mr. Brezhnev at one point, to his own people, publicly made the statement that through detente they had gained enough that they would soon, shortly, be able to have their way and work their will throughout the world. Well, that is not really detente. ENTITY, if SDI is not negotiable at the moment, so there might be no compromise also on ballistic missiles, could you envision an understanding with Mr. Gorbachev in the area of theater nuclear weapons already in Geneva? Well, yes, as you say, this is already in Geneva. And this is definitely one of the topics we will take up there at the summit. As you know, our original proposal was-we were willing to cancel all of them. The Soviets were sitting with SS-20's in great numbers, multiple-warhead missiles targeted on Europe. And Europe had asked us-before my arrival here-had asked my predecessor for weapons to counter those. And the agreement was made that we would. And I inherited the job when I got in here of providing those weapons. They had not yet been delivered. We at no time ever were delivering an equal number of what the Soviets had, but we did propose zero-zero. And on that case, the Soviets met us halfway-zero for us and they'd continue to have their SS-20's. But, yes, we would like to see that, as we are negotiating in Geneva, as treated separately from the intercontinental ballistic missiles, the strategic weapons, to see if we could not eliminate those medium-range weapons that could target each other in a matter of just a few minutes. So, you should be closer in this area? Well, I know that the Soviets have talked about such things as a nuclear-free zone in Europe. And we are willing to engage them, and will, in conversation on that kind of a subject. ENTITY, in the past, you have referred to the Soviet Union as an evil empire. Then, lately, you avoided the expression. Have you changed your opinion, or do you still consider that Gorbachev, U.S.S.R., is still a totalitarian regime? Well, it is a totalitarian regime. They do not see freedom for their people as the democracies do. But as I have said before, we are not trying to change their system internally. What I think it is necessary to do is to let them know that the democratic world is not going to hold still for their expansionism into other parts of the world and to our own countries. Yes, I used the term the evil empire. There've been some things that have gone on that-and yet I have a few quotes of my own that they have said; one in which they even called us cannibals. So, I think both of us have stopped that language, thinking that we will get farther at the meetings if we come together to try and eliminate the need for such talk. ENTITY, the summit of Geneva will be the first in 6 years, and you will have about 8 hours of discussion with Mr. Gorbachev, which is not so much. So, what kind of approach will you try on him? Will you try a kind of man-to-man approach to try to convince, to get your point? Yes. As a matter of fact, there are some meetings scheduled where it will just be one on one, the two of us. And I will do my utmost, with the evidence at hand, to prove to them that if he does nurse any suspicion that we mean him harm-I think the presentation of some facts such as at the end of World War II, when we were the only nation whose industry and capacity had not been bombed to rubble, when we were the only ones with the nuclear weapon, we could have been pretty dictatorial, ourselves, in the world. But we were not ; we did not do that-and then point out to him how we see their expansionist policies and so forth and see if we cannot come together and recognize that this-when I said deeds, this is how we can eliminate the suspicion. I think the theme that I will take was cited by someone-the line is not original with me-who said that nations do not distrust each other because they are armed, they are armed because they distrust each other. So, we will see if we cannot work on that last half. ENTITY, this is obviously the most important meeting of your Presidency. You are up against a very formidable figure. I wonder, are you nervous at all? Not really, no. Maybe I am relying on past experience. Long before I ever thought I would be in public life in this way-for about 20 years, I did the negotiating for the union of which I was ENTITY for 6 of those 20 years, our contract negotiations, repeatedly, with management. I am the first ENTITY who was ever president of a labor union. And I think I know something about negotiating, and I intend to go at it in the same manner. ENTITY, do you really want an agreement with the Soviets, and considering the situation and the differences, the gap between the two systems, what kind of an agreement do you want? On what basis? Naturally, this is in perspective, not only Geneva. Let us see Geneva as the starting point. Well, an overall agreement that we do understand the positions that we are in as the two so-called superpowers and that we have a great responsibility to maintain peace in the world and that it does not mean that we interfere with each other's internal policies at all, but that we agree to exist in the world and compete peacefully. And that is the overall tone I think that should come out of the summit. But as I say, it cannot just be based on each of us making a promise and saying we feel that way. There have to be some things done, some deeds that really prove that we mean our words. ENTITY, do you already have a forward copy of the new book of Mr. Gorbachev, Time for Peace, which will come to the market this week? No, I do not have that. I will look forward to that. ENTITY, do you intend to meet Mr. Gorbachev regularly, maybe on an annual base? I think whether it is on an annual basis or back and forth and so forth, I think those are things to be settled at this summit. But I definitely think that a great measure of success would be if we came away from this meeting with a decision that we were going to continue meeting and discussing the problems between us. ENTITY, it has been said that there will be no final communique, but will you bet, at least, on a set of guidelines to give a new impetus to the arms talk? Yes, I am not a great fan of communiques, the sort of settling on a statement in advance. And I know we discussed this with them. I think that it'd make far more sense if each one of us came forth and gave our own view of the meetings and what had been achieved, told frankly what had been accomplished and what had not . I have agreed with the heads of state of our NATO allies that on the day that we leave Geneva to come home, I am going by way of Brussels, and if they will be there, I am going to give a briefing right then. And then, when I arrive here that night, I am going to go directly from the plane to the Congress and before a Joint Session of our Congress and on television to the people of the United States, report on the meetings. And I think that is a better thing to do. If there are things that we have not been able to agree on, let us be willing to say it, but say we will keep on trying-but not have a communique which all too often seems to want to gloss over the things that were not accomplished. So, how will we know whether you have failed or succeeded? Will it be whether you have managed to set up another meeting? Well, I think it'll be on the basis of when I report, judgment of the outcome of the things that I will specify that were done or the things that were left undone or the things, then, that we have agreed to go on talking about. Sir, apparently, according to several reports, Mr. Shultz came back from Moscow with quite a bad impression of Mr. Gorbachev. Do you share that opinion? Now, who did you say came away with the- Mr. Shultz Oh. -according to several reports No, no, as a matter of fact, he told me that they kind of went at it and that he was argumentative and interrupted at times. But then he said he, George Shultz, interrupted also and found out that it was not resented, that it was that kind of a free-for-all discussion. And he said that he was very set in his ways-or I mean, about his views on the aims of his country and so forth. And, well, we are very set on ours. ENTITY, in the second debate with the then-candidate of the Democrats, Mr. Mondale, you said that, even possibly, you would share the results of the scientific research on SDI with the Russians in order to make the world safer. Do you still consider in doing that, finally? Maybe I did not make it clear. That is what I meant in my earlier answer-not just share the scientific research with them. Let me give you my dream of what would happen. We have the weapon. We do not start deploying it. We get everybody together, and we say, Here, here it is. And here is how it works and what it'll do to incoming missiles. Now, we think that all of us who have nuclear weapons should agree that we are going to eliminate the nuclear weapons. But we will make available to everyone this weapon. I do not mean we will give it to them. They are going to have to pay for it--but at cost. But we would make this defensive weapon available. Now, some can say, Well, if you are going to do away with the nuclear offensive weapons, then, why does anyone need this? Well, because we all know how to make it. And someday there may be a madman in the world, as there have been before, who would start in secretly to produce these weapons. But it is like when in Geneva in 1925 all the nations of the world after World War I got rid of poison gas-everybody kept their gas masks. Well, the same thing-this is kind of the gas mask thing. We could say, Look, we will never, any of us, have to fear that maybe some one of us cheating or maybe there is going to be that madman someday if we all have the ability to defend ourselves against nuclear missiles. And I think this would make far more sense than for us to say, Oh, we found it. We will go ahead and deploy it now while we still keep our other missiles. The world would have a right to expect that maybe we were thinking first blow. And if the Soviets do not share that view, what will happen? I certainly do not believe that we could stand by and let them veto our use or implementation of a defensive weapon. ENTITY, what is your feeling when some of your allies, France, but not only France, are either reluctant or openly opposed to the SDI? What can you tell them? Well, I think there was some misunderstanding about it and where we were going with it. And I know in the meetings up at New York, at the U.N. opening this time, there was a great change on the part of a number of them when I explained what our view of this was. And so I think that there is not that great opposition to it. And a number of the countries where they, as governments, did not want to become involved, for whatever reasons they had, but would not object to their own scientists, their own private business firms and so forth, or industries getting involved and joining in with us in this research and development. ENTITY, on behalf of my colleagues here, I would like to thank you very much for granting us this interview and sharing your views just a week before your summit meeting in Geneva with the Soviet leader. Thank you very much, ENTITY Well, I am greatly honored that you all wanted to do this, and thank you very much. I appreciate it.

{"id": 370, "text": "Well, I just want to say what a pipe dream this has been. Greatest sight in the world. Think of the people who would like to change places with you. What can you tell us of your visit here, your trip, ENTITY? I have had quite a full three days. Accomplished a great deal. . . . By coincidence, I think it was exactly ten years to the day since my previous visit. Of course, I find many changes here on the military and naval front. I never imagined any place could change as much as the Island of Oahu has. Today, city-occupied land extends right up to the military and naval areas. The city has gone to the military and naval areas, where a few years ago the military and navy had to go to the city. There are small communities all over the island. Land is scarce, instead of being plentiful. One other thing I noticed. Two and one-half years ago - December, 1941-I got a whole great flood of telegrams from the Islands asking me to please send food right away. They thought everybody in the Islands was going to starve. They were asking for food. I said, I am frightfully sorry. I have not got any food to send you. Have not got any ships to send it in if I had it. So I made the very simple recommendation: grow more. And the Islands have grown more. As for the necessities of life, they have been forced to solve their own problem. They have solved it, and they have helped, too, by not demanding everything from the continent. And I do not notice that anybody has starved. They have done a good job, and done it out here. ENTITY, could you to help our stories, describe the purpose of your visit to the Hawaiian Islands? Well, as I remember, one of the objects of the trip was to look this place over. This is no longer the outpost of our defense. A few years ago it was. We were not allowed to fortify Guam. Today the outermost points of our defense line are thousands of miles to the westward. Hawaii is still the main distributing point, but not the outpost. It is our main depot nearest to where we are meeting the enemy in the Pacific. The other thing that we have talked about, of course, is the strategic question. I have had two very successful days with Nimitz, MacArthur, and Leahy, talking about future plans. It is perfectly obvious that any operation has to be planned ahead. You have seen that about a particular operation. And you will remember that that particular operation was talked about, and the logistics of it talked about, for many, many months before. We have had several conferences on different questions. Of course, I cannot go into more details than that. Within the limits of security, can you tell if these conferences involved any new offensives against Japan? Yes. Soon, ENTITY? They have been continuing in fairly regular progress in the last year, and now that we have the offensive we shall keep it. . . . At your conference at Casablanca, you gave us a very fine phrase about unconditional surrender. Are we going to make that our goal out here in the Pacific? I wonder if you could tell us anything about that from your talks here? There is nothing I can tell you, except that at Casablanca I made no differentiation between our European enemy and our Far Eastern enemy. The same thing applies to Japan. And the goal with Japan is still unconditional surrender? Still is with everybody. There has been a good deal of complaint among some of the nice, high-minded people about unconditional surrender, that if we changed the term unconditional surrender, Germany might surrender more quickly. Mr. Churchill and I have made no modification of the terms of unconditional surrender. They complain that it is too tough and too rough. I will explain it a little this way. Back in 1865, Lee was driven into a corner back of Richmond, at Appomattox Court House. His army was practically starving, had had no sleep for two or three days, his arms were practically expended. So he went, under a flag of truce, to Grant. Lee had come to Grant thinking about his men. He asked Grant for his terms of surrender. Grant said, Unconditional surrender. Lee said he could not do that, he had to get some things. Just for example, he had no food for more than one meal for his army. Grant said, That is pretty tough. Lee then said, My cavalry horses do not belong to us, they belong to our officers and they need them back home. Grant said, Unconditional surrender. Lee then said, All right. I surrender, and tendered his sword to Grant. Grant said, Bob, put it back. Now, do you unconditionally surrender? Lee said, Yes. Then Grant said, You are my prisoners now. Do you need food for your men? Lee said, Yes. I have not got more than enough for one meal more. Then Grant said, Now, about those horses that belong to the Confederate officers. Why do you want them? Lee said, We need them for the spring plowing. Grant said, Tell your officers to take the animals home and do the spring plowing. There you have unconditional surrender. I have given you no new term. We are human beings-normal, thinking human beings. That is what we mean by unconditional surrender. The fact is that unconditional surrender still stands? Yes. Practically all Germans deny the fact they surrendered in the last war, but this time they are going to know it. And so are the Japs. Is that to demonstrate the fact that eventually we may have to feed the liberated in all these countries? We will help them get back on their feet physically. We do not believe in wholesale starvation. But it does not mean that we will send the first spare food that we have into Germany. We will take care of our own and our allies first. . . . When General MacArthur was about to leave the Philippines, I recall he said something to the general effect that I will return. In view of the setting of this meeting with him, is there anything that you could tell us? Is that true now? The only thing I could say in answer to that question, in answer to any direct question, would be such as to possibly give the enemy an inkling as to which way we are going. We are going to get the Philippines back, and without question General MacArthur will take a part in it. Whether he goes direct or not, I cannot say. Can we say that General MacArthur will return to the Philippines? He was correct the day he left Corregidor, and I told him he was correct. Remember, I came out and said it then? When I say General MacArthur, I mean that we shall return to the Philippines. Yes, and General MacArthur shall take part. ENTITY, from your conferences here, will there be any emphasis or speedup in the conduct of the war? Neither one nor the other. Were you reviewing or reestablishing strategy? Well, you review or reestablish strategy about once a week as you go along, it is just normal procedure. But it was very useful, this particular conference. I think it was one of the most important we have held in some time. I found it was awfully hard to get along without it, because I have not talked in person with General MacArthur in the past seven years-have not seen him for seven years. He was then my Chief of Staff in Washington. . . . Why do you think that United States soldiers have been able to beat the Japanese at their own game of atoll and jungle fighting? Perhaps it sounds like a little bit of boasting, but it is the difference between our type of civilization and our type of fellow, and their type of civilization and fellow. We will take them on at any game, war or pleasure, and beat them at it. . ..", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsfromthepressconferencehonolulu", "title": "Excerpts from the Press Conference in Honolulu", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/excerpts-from-the-press-conference-honolulu", "publication_date": "29-07-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 408, "text": "Good afternoon, everybody. Very calm in here. Let us see if we can keep it that way. ENTITY, no pressure, but you will go first. Thanks, ENTITY. I wanted to start with a statement that President Obama and some of the Western leaders released this morning on Syria and the crisis in Aleppo. And I was wondering if that statement was intended to signal support specifically for this five-day ceasefire that a number of Syrian rebel factions are calling for, or if the leaders were just referring more generally to the crisis and trying to call attention to it. ENTITY, my understanding is they are not seeking to show support for any one specific plan. There are a variety of proposals that have been put forward that would reduce the violence sufficiently to allow innocent Syrians in Aleppo to get out of harm's way, and for the consistent flow of humanitarian aid to commence, particularly to those regions of the country and to those areas of the city that have been under siege for a long time. So as you'd expect, ENTITY, these kinds of statements take some time to be negotiated through diplomatic channels, and so this is not in response to one specific proposal that is been put forward, but rather demonstrating clear, unified international support for some kind of diplomatic arrangement that reduces the violence and allows the flow of humanitarian assistance to commence in a sustained way. And the statement was very critical, even condemning, of Russia for its role in facilitating the continuation of violence through its actions at the U.N. and elsewhere. And I am wondering, given the fact that the U.S. is still talking with Russia about this -- I believe Secretary of State Kerry is meeting Lavrov even today in Germany -- what is the utility of continuing to try to work with Russia on that when we are , in the same breath, saying you guys are the problem, you are the reason that there is not progress on this? Well, ENTITY, I think the strategy is essentially to apply pressure to Russia because of the tactics that they have been willing to not just condone but, in some cases, actively support that have resulted in significant innocent loss of life. And it is continuing. And the President does not believe it is an effective strategy to gloss over or somehow obscure Russia's complicity in this sordid affair in order to reach a solution. In fact, we actually believe that Russia bears special responsibility to help bring about a diplomatic solution because of the way that it intervened on behalf of the Assad regime and because of their own stated significant national interest in the outcome of the situation inside of Syria. So we are not going to advance a diplomatic solution by somehow acting like Russia has been a good actor when they have not , or pretending that Russia somehow does not have a stake in the outcome when the truth is they have got as big a stake in the outcome as any other country outside of Syria. So it is time for them to play a responsible role. And thus far, they have not . And that is isolated them in the international community. It is what makes them the object of so much criticism and even scorn from the international community because of their willingness to support actively the depraved tactics of the Assad regime to try to bomb innocent civilians into submission. Philippine President Duterte has given out a readout of his recent conversation with President-elect Trump and he says that Trump said basically, do not worry about U.S. concerns about your fight against drug criminals; go ahead, you are doing a good job. How alarming is that to the U.S., given that what we are essentially talking about -- or what you have talked about from that podium is the killing of thousands of people without any kind of due process? ENTITY, I have no special knowledge of the telephone conversation between the President-elect and the President of the Philippine, so I cannot be in a position to critique the view that is being expressed by the President-elect to the President of the Philippines. What I can do, however, is restate the position of this administration, the position of the current U.S. government, and that is simply that extrajudicial killings are entirely inconsistent with the notion of the rule of law and a commitment to upholding basic, universal human rights. It is plain and simple. There is a significant challenge facing the government of the Philippines to combat the drug trade in their country. And it raises significant questions about their economy and about the security situation in the Philippines. That is a legitimate problem that is worth confronting. And, in fact, the United States has been supportive of previous efforts by the Philippines to confront the drug trade and try to limit, if not eradicate it. But President Duterte has certainly raised concerns about the degree to which his government is at least willing to look the other way while these kinds of extrajudicial killings are taking place and while vigilante justice is being meted out. That is not going to solve the problem. The President gave a long speech about this yesterday, about how it is important that our efforts to advance the interests of the United States and provide for the security of the United States is enhanced when we do it consistent with our values. That same principle applies to other countries, as well. The other principle that I think is at stake here is a little higher-level principle, but it is an important one nonetheless. One of the reasons that it is important for us to invest in the durability and strength of our alliances is so that we can acknowledge publicly when we disagree. It is the sign of a strong relationship that we can acknowledge differences of opinion and encourage our closest friends around the world to live up to the values that our countries and our people prioritize. It is a sign of weakness in a relationship if you cannot acknowledge differences of opinion. That is true in interpersonal matters; it is also true in international diplomacy. And we do not agree with our allies on every issue. And preserving the strength of those alliances and investing in the strength of those alliances allows us to, where appropriate, air those differences and not shy away from them. And in this case, it is important because the United States draws upon our adherence to these values because it contributes to our influence around the world. Countries want to be allied with the United States because they recognize what it is that we stand for. And when we stay true to those values, it only enhances our influence around the globe. That makes us safer. And signaling a willingness to backtrack from those values is bad for our individual relationships, but it is also bad for -- degrades our ability to exert our influence around the world. And lastly, is the White House amenable to adding a provision in the short-term spending bill to essentially fast-track a waiver for General Mattis, given that the President is going to have to sign this bill to keep the government funded? Well, there are a couple of principles at play here, ENTITY. The first is that President Obama has long made the argument that while the Senate does have some responsibility to confirm the President's nominees -- to offer that advice and consent is a fundamental responsibility of the Senate -- at the same time, the President of the United States should be given a lot -- significant latitude to assemble his team. In many instances, that courtesy was not extended to this President by Republicans in the Senate. But the President believes that is an important principle. And again, that is a principle that can be faithfully observed without eroding the constitutional responsibility of the United States Senate to offer their advice and consent. Second, when it comes to General Mattis, we are talking about somebody that President Obama knows. General Mattis served as the commander of Central Command for two or three years while President Obama was in office. He is somebody who served his country with distinction. He is a decorated Marine Corps veteran. But President Obama believes that -- well, the standard that we have tried to set is to not comment on, pass judgment on the individuals that the President-elect has put forward to serve in his Cabinet. And I am going to try to abide by that principle here. This is not really about General Mattis and his own views on issues or anything. It is about the fact that he is a general, and that in order for him to be confirmed there would have to be a waiver passed by Congress to permit that. So it is kind of a different principle. Yes, well, I think all these principles come into play, though. And I certainly would not want any sort of commentary about this matter to be construed as some sort of implicit criticism of General Mattis -- for a variety of reasons, including he is somebody who has served this country with distinction under Democratic and Republican Presidents, and he is supported, based on the public comments I have seen, by both Democrats and Republicans that he is interacted with in the context of his job. What I will say seems odd is that Senate Republicans feel the need to tuck this provision into a budget bill in order to advance it, instead of having this question of a waiver be considered on its merits. So the kind of tactics and legislative strategy, to the extent there is one, that has regularly been applied by senators in the Congress is one that I have been mystified by in the past, so this is not exactly an unprecedented kind of situation. But, in general, what I can say is that President Obama believes in the principle of the President being able to assemble a team. He certainly believes in the principle that somebody like General Mattis is a decorated Marine, has demonstrated his patriotism and service to the country, has served this country with distinction, but ultimately the President-elect and the next Congress are going to have to determine how exactly to advance his nomination to the Senate. More on appointments. Today, President-elect Trump told the Today Show that he has consulted President Obama about some of his appointments and that he takes the President's recommendations very seriously, and also that I guess at least one of the appointments or some of the appointments were highly -- or were liked by President Obama, according to President-elect Trump. So I just wondered -- I know that you have declined to kind of talk about what the President thinks of all the appointments, but I guess what type of advice is the President giving to President-elect Trump? Trump talked about it today. So what type of advice is he giving him as he appoints his Cabinet? And also can you speak even about this kind of burgeoning relationship? I mean, at this point, Trump has repeatedly said that he likes President Obama and he thinks President Obama likes him, too. So can you talk about this relationship? This would probably make for an interesting episode of Dr. Phil. Not that I am giving them any programming ideas -- but they can take that one and run with it. Look, I know that the President-elect had an opportunity when he was asked in an interview to talk a little bit about his consultations with President Obama. And he is the President-elect of the United States, and he is on the other end of the phone when the President is talking, so he is got a little more latitude to do that than I do. I am going to, from here, in my role, going to protect the ability of the President of the United States to consult in private with the President-elect. I have , on a number of occasions, confirmed that there have been at least a handful of conversations between the President and the President-elect, in addition to the Oval Office meeting that all of you observed, something that took place 36 hours after the votes were tallied on Election Day. And after that meeting, the President-elect told all of you that it was his expectation the he would consult frequently with the President of the United States because he believed it would be helpful to him. And since that time, we have made clear that President Obama was not just a willing participant in those kinds of conversations but that he would welcome the opportunity to be as helpful as he possibly could to the incoming President. And that is what he has tried to do. That is what we have tried to do as an administration in terms of ensuring a smooth and effective transition to the next administration. But for the content of the conversations that are occurring between the two men, that is not something that I am going to speak about from here. So there is no -- like you could not talk about maybe an overarching kind of guidance that he is trying to give him when it comes to the Cabinet? Look, I think the way that I would describe it is consultation, and the President is responsive to requests and phone calls from the President-elect. But beyond that, I just do not have any additional insight that I can share about the nature of the telephone conversations. Going back to Aleppo, I just want to be clear. Does the administration have a position on what the rebels should do? Should they withdraw from Aleppo? I guess Syria and Russia have called for that, said they will not consider a ceasefire until the rebels leave Aleppo. Does the U.S. have a position on that? The U.S. position is that the United Nations is working tirelessly to try to broker the kind of ceasefire in Aleppo that would allow for the significant flow of badly needed humanitarian assistance. The opposition has agreed to the U.N. plan. And we believe that the Syrians should, too. We believe that the Russians should use their influence with the Assad regime to get them to agree to that plan. But whether it is the U.N. plan or some other diplomatic negotiation that results in a reduction of violence and an increase in humanitarian assistance, that is what we are after. And the chief obstacle to that goal has been the depraved military tactics of the Assad regime and the complicity of the Russians and Iranians. And that is the position that we are trying to get them to change. And it is a position that, thus far, has resulted in widespread bloodshed and a genuine human tragedy inside of Syria. And the longer that the Syrian government and the Russians and Iranians resist this potential solution, the more conflict and more violence and more bloodshed and more tragedy will occur. Just to clear up some of these things that have been said on both sides of these phone calls between the President and President-elect -- does the President enjoy these phone calls? The President is pleased that he can play a role in ensuring a smooth and effective transition. And that is something that he has identified as a very high priority, particularly for his last several weeks in office here. So he is certainly pleased that he can offer advice and assistance that may be useful to the incoming administration. And now that President-elect Trump has been pretty detailed in his description and he, just today, as Ayesha was saying, he said that he really does like -- that he loves getting his ideas. Can it at least be said -- does the President like Donald Trump? Does he like talking to him as a person? Listen, for the President's personal feelings you should just talk to the President about that. And it is important that -- we will do another news conference here and maybe somebody will choose to ask. But I cannot speak to their personal relationship. What I can speak to is the President's ongoing commitment to coordinating effectively with the President-elect's team and the President-elect personally to ensure a smooth and effective transition. And that is included not just in the Oval Office meeting 36 hours after the votes were tallied, but it is also included additional telephone calls between the two men and a variety of meetings at a variety of levels at agencies all across the federal government to give the incoming administration the best opportunity to get off to a running start. Since the last time we asked you about these phone calls -- and you mentioned that there had been a handful -- have there been any more between then and now? I do not remember exactly the last time that I was asked, so I cannot confirm any additional calls at this point. One thing you have spoken to a number of times both before and after the election are what you call the deep concerns that the President has going forward with this new administration. So is it safe to say that the President still has concerns about some of the picks that Trump has made? Well, I do not have a -- we are not going to take a position on individual nominees that are put forward by the President-elect. I think what those deep concerns often referred to were some of the rhetoric and policy positions that were advocated by Mr. Trump when he was running for President. But elections have consequences. And while those concerns have not gone away, the election is over, and the institutional responsibility of the President and everybody who works for him is to focus on putting our political differences and our political opinions aside and fulfilling the duties that the American people have entrusted us with, which is to serve the public and to give the choice of the American voters the opportunity to succeed in the years ahead. So the numerous concerns that both the President and you listed have not been assuaged at all by anything you have seen since the election? Listen, I think it is too early to judge. And people all across the country will have the opportunity to do exactly that. And, look, President-elect Trump ran for office advocating a much different approach to running the country than the one that President Obama has pursued over the last eight years. He said he wanted to do things differently and he found a variety of very colorful ways to make that quite clear to everybody who was walking into the voting booth. And the outcome of the election is such that Secretary Clinton got 2.5 million more votes, but President-elect Trump won the election. He won the Electoral College. He will be the next President of the United States. And the American people will have an opportunity to see whether or not the different kind of approach that he is advocating actually yields better results. So we certainly want people to understand exactly what kind of progress this country was able to make under the leadership of President Obama, to persuade them of the wisdom of that approach so that they will be able to evaluate it against the kind of changed approach that President-elect Trump is vowing to pursue. Over the last couple of days we have heard some pretty heavy criticism of certain of Donald Trump's picks. And I know you do not want to get into individual assessments or anything, and I am not asking for that. But when you talk about concerns that are still there, do those include the people that he is choosing to be around him? Well, I do not want to signal a position one way or the other on some of --on any of the President-elect's personnel decisions. I think the obvious thing that I would be willing to say is that President-elect Trump is choosing people with different views and different styles than the kinds of people that President Obama chose. And the American people were very well served by the service of people like Secretary Burwell, who has effectively implemented the Affordable Care Act; or Secretary McDonald, who has implemented a series of reforms and reduced the backlog at the VA, and expanded and improved the delivery of benefits being provided to our veterans; or there are people like Secretary Carter, who has undertaken significant efforts to strengthen our military and making sure that we are making smart planning decisions so that the future of the U.S. military is effectively adapted to the challenges that we may face moving forward. So, look, I could cite examples all across the administration, not just at the Cabinet level, but also at the White House. The kinds of people that President-elect Trump has chosen appear to have, in many cases, different priorities, different styles and, in some cases, starkly different bank accounts. But the President-elect should benefit from the latitude -- significant latitude to choose his team. -- a little contrast there? Yes, I think I am. I do think that over -- look, at the end of eight years, we will have a variety of benchmarks and metrics to evaluate how the United States of America benefitted from the priorities, agenda, and leadership style of President Obama. And there will be a very clear opportunity for all of you, in particular, to evaluate whether or not the kinds of changes that President-elect Trump puts in place benefit the country. And that is an open question, but it is an experiment that the American people in all their wisdom have chosen to conduct. Are you saying their bank account affects someone's capability? Not at all. I think it -- I do not think it would actually have much of an impact at all on anybody's ability to serve the country. Why did you say it then? Mostly to be funny. And it got a couple of chuckles. Thanks for spelling that out. I guess that goes to that old adage, though, if you have to explain the joke, it was not that funny. So maybe it was not . Okay, the CR. Yes. Yes, it came out last night -- April 28th, a lot of riders, but a lot of funding. Will the President sign it? Well, I can tell you that the President and his team were up late last night -- I do not know if the President was up late last night reviewing the bill, but the President's team, the experts at the OMB and other agencies that are trying to understand the consequences of some of the proposals that are included in the CR have been carefully analyzing that. I am not ready to render a judgment one way or the other on the proposal. But I can tell you that we continue to review the legislation and are looking at the finer points to make sure we understand exactly what impact the passage of the bill would have on funding the U.S. government. Do you believe that we can avoid a government shutdown in two days? Is there enough time to pass this CR? Well, I am certainly no expert on legislative procedure and as I have observed on many other occasions, even simple things have posed a significant challenge to this Republican-led Congress, so I am not making any predictions. I certainly hope we will be able to avoid a government shutdown. I cannot envision a scenario in which the U.S. economy or the American people somehow benefit from a government shutdown. So hopefully that is something we will be able to avoid. What it will require is something that it is required the last couple of years, which is compromise. And that is another thing that Republicans in Congress have not demonstrated much of an ability to do. But it will be required in this instance. It is going to require bipartisan compromise for this bill to pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law by a Democratic President. The President is willing to compromise. He does not expect that every element of the CR should be something that he wholeheartedly supports. He recognizes that this will be a compromise. But we are taking a look at the bill to understand exactly what sort of compromise will be required, and we will let you know as soon as we can about the final conclusion that is been reached. Do you expect to have a judgment today on that? I do not know how much progress they have been able to make on it today, but we will keep you posted. Anything on the General Flynn-Ambassador Rice meeting? I do not have anything on that. I know that there have been some reports about Ambassador Rice meeting with the individual that the President-elect designated to succeed her in the fancy corner office in the West Wing. What I can tell you is that, more generally, the National Security Council, under the leadership of Dr. Rice, has spent months preparing materials, assembling briefing books, compiling information to ensure a smooth and effective transition into the next administration. So I am not in a position to confirm any individual meetings that have taken place, but I can tell you that there have been a variety of meetings that have already occurred that are focused on achieving that goal. And when we are talking about the National Security Council, we are talking about the organization that is responsible for managing a range of very sensitive issues. So a lot of close coordination and consultation will be required to ensure a smooth handoff here. And we are certainly committed -- and I know that Dr. Rice is personally committed -- to ensuring that we are going to do everything that is required to make that happen. The statement on Syria by the six nations, how was that initiated? Was that something that the President initiated? Or who? I am not sure, you may have answered that. But I -- Yes, I am not aware that there was any individual presidential-level conversation about this. But obviously the President has had a number of conversations with some of the world leaders who signed on to this statement about the situation in Syria. I ask because you have always emphasized how the President is trying to use every diplomatic means available to him to effect a more positive situation there. So this does not fall into that category? Well, no -- look, the President has worked assiduously to mobilize the international community to respond to the situation inside of Syria, and there were a number of conversations that President Obama has had with the leaders of these countries who signed on to the statement in a variety of settings. And this has been a long-running effort. And, look, I think this is a good example of how U.S. leadership is important in the international community and is effective in advancing our interests. It does not benefit the United States of America for there to be continued chaos inside of Syria. And President Obama continues to rally the international community both through our counter-ISIL coalition, but also through diplomacy like this to try to find the kind of diplomatic solution that will bring an end to the violence inside of Syria that will expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance, but also make the world safer for the American people. In an interview -- in a tease about an interview that the President did on CNN -- I believe it was about ISIS -- he said something to the effect that ISIS's ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar. Have you heard that? I think this may be the CNN documentary that is running later today. So the statement, again, ISIS's ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar -- does that suggest a huge failure on the part of the administration to see this threat coming? Maybe you are making a reference to an event that is not coming to mind here. What are you referring to here? The President's statement in this interview where he said, ISIS's ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar. So you are talking about in Iraq in 2014? Exactly. Okay. I thought this was a reference to the President's speech yesterday. But now I see what you are trying to talk about. Look, I think this may be a situation where let us take a look at the President's -- the entire context of the President's remarks. I think we have talked a lot about how the Iraqi security forces did not perform at a level that we expected them to, even in the face of this threat from ISIL. And that is something that I know that I have talked about from here, and something the President has talked about before. But we will take a closer look at the President's comments when they air in full tonight. He seemed to suggest an intelligence failure -- or admit one -- on the part of the United States -- not necessarily a failure by the Iraqis, a failure on the American side to see this coming. Lastly, what does the President think of Joe Biden in 2020? I have not asked him about it. I think that as the Vice President was answering the question, I think that he -- well, I did not talk to the Vice President about it either, so -- You could not think of anything funny to say? Well, not for the first time in my life and certainly not for the first time in the context of this job. I will let the Vice President's comment stand. And if he chooses to further clarify them, then he will do that himself, or I will have a conversation with him and see if I can bring some greater clarity. INTERVIEWER1, nice to see you. Nice to see you. The President, yesterday in his remarks, talked about Guantanamo -- hundreds of millions' expense to keep 59 guys there, a blot on our national conscience. But he stopped short of saying that he is actually going to shut the place down before he leaves. Was this a final sort of coming to terms with the fact that the prison is going to stay open after he leaves office? Well, listen, we have been deeply dismayed at the obstacles that Congress has erected to prevent progress on this significant national security priority. Democratic and Republican national security experts strongly support the President's position that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would save taxpayer dollars and make the country safer. A variety of military leaders have reached that conclusion. Even President George W. Bush, who has different views on foreign policy than President Obama in most areas, but in this area, he agrees that the prison should be closed. So there is strong bipartisan agreement among those who have dedicated their lives to protecting the country that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed, and the American people would benefit from it. But this is a political situation that members of Congress in both parties, to be fair, have allowed to persist that prevents this kind of common-sense policy from being implemented. That is been deeply disappointing to the President. And we are going to continue to do everything we can between now and the President's departure to reduce the prison population at Gitmo. And there is a strategy that we have initiated that includes the individual review of these prisoners to determine the wisdom of transferring them overseas. And when this interagency panel determines that an individual, under the right restrictions, can be safely transferred to another country, we are doing the important diplomatic work of finding another country who will take them. And since President Obama has been in office, there are about 175 Gitmo detainees that have been transferred under these conditions. And that is been good for the country. But Congress has repeatedly thrown up obstacles that prevent the successful closing of the prison. That was not admitting defeat? Well, the President has been deeply disappointed by how Congress has refused to fulfill their basic responsibility to save taxpayer dollars, or at least spend their money judiciously, and enhance the national security of the United States. On both metrics, with regard to this policy, Congress has fallen down on the job. And that is been a source of significant frustration that we have expressed from time to time over the last eight years. You talked about some of the national security officials who support closure. One of them who clearly did not is the man who looks to be the new Department of Homeland Security chief, General Kelly, who has argued that Guantanamo is not only operated well, but that it has a place in our national security framework, and prisoners should be there. So is the President disappointed to see that the President-elect is putting someone into this position who is on record saying no one is innocent at Gitmo and that it should stay open? Listen, I want to be real clear about our position about the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay should not be viewed by anybody as an attempt to impugn or criticize the service of our men and women in uniform who are operating that prison. That is difficult work. And so I do not want this policy position to be portrayed by somebody as a criticism of our men and women in uniform. With respect to General Kelly's comments, I am going to reserve comment on anybody that President-elect Trump has put forward for a senior Cabinet-level position. Obviously, as I alluded to earlier, many of them have positions that are different than positions that this administration has prioritized. And that is not particularly surprising given the outcome of the election. But I do not have a specific reaction to General Kelly's stated position on this issue. A question on Syria, to come back to it? Sure. In the language of the statement you released this morning, you seem to be suggesting something like sanctions. You said restrictive measures on entities and individuals are being considered . You have got sanctions on Russia, sanctions on Iran, sanctions on the Assad regime. These are all punitive. They are clearly not prohibitive. They have done absolutely nothing to stop the violence in Aleppo or in Syria. So is this kind of rhetoric the extent of the action the United States and the world powers are going to take right now? Well, the extent of the action that we are taking is, first and foremost, military action against ISIL terrorists and other extremists inside of Syria that are trying to capitalize on the chaos to plot and execute attacks against the United States and the West. And so -- Well, the statement was about that 200,000 civilians and children are being denied medicine and food. That is what you are statement was about. That was what the statement was about. But people should not be confused about the totality of U.S. action to protect the American people and advance our interests around the world, including in Syria. And our actions in Syria have taken ISIL leaders off the battlefield. They have taken other extremists off the battlefield, including extremists who are plotting and planning to carry out attacks against the United States and our allies in the West. And so there is a lot of focus on the situation in Aleppo, and there should be. In fact, there probably should be more. But we should not allow the tragedy in Aleppo to obscure the important work that is being done by the United States military and our 67 coalition partners to take the fight to ISIL, to increase pressure on extremists, and to enhance the national security of the United States. With regard to Aleppo, our efforts do not just include negotiations among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. They also include supporting a U.N.-led effort to try to facilitate a diplomatic agreement. And they also include extensive repeated discussions with the Russians to try to bring them to the negotiating table so that they use their influence with the Assad regime to get us closer to an agreement. But the Russians have been resistant to doing that. And that is what is allowed this tragedy to continue. But ultimately, the United States is playing a leading role in the international community -- to organize the international community to apply pressure to Russia, Iran and Syria to bring them to the negotiating table. They are going to have to be a part of any negotiated solution. And that is what we are trying to bring about. Respectfully, the international community efforts -- five or six U.N. resolutions have been killed so far, all the diplomatic talks have failed. So that is why the question -- The reason why we are still working on it is because we have not gotten the results we'd like to see yet. But it is just rhetoric, it is just words at this point. And there is an immediate crisis. I mean, Kerry is talking to Lavrov today. He is going to Paris this weekend. But in the meantime, there are people very much in crisis, which is what your statement is about. So is the statement the extent of immediate action? No. There is a meeting with Russia that Secretary Kerry is planning later this week. There are continued efforts at the U.N. to apply diplomatic pressure to the situation. There are continued talks that are being led by the U.N. to try to facilitate a diplomatic agreement. If there were an obvious or simple military solution, it is certainly possible that the United States and our allies, or at least our partners in the counter-ISIL coalition, would have considered it by now. But we have said from the beginning, from day one, that the ultimate solution here is a diplomatic one. And diplomacy is hard. And Russia, in particular, has been resistant to engaging constructively in pursuit of that negotiated solution. And we have been profoundly disappointed by that, and lives have been lost as a result of that. There is no denying that. But it is certainly not for any sort of lack of effort or lack of action on the part of the United States. And we continue to mobilize and lead the international community both to look after the national security interests of the United States but also to try to bring this human tragedy to an end. What are the restrictive measures that you are talking about in the statement? Well, there are a variety of things that have been considered, including the kinds of financial penalties that the United States has been able to apply in coordination with our allies in a variety of situations. And I certainly would not rule out something like that in the future, but I would also acknowledge that we have not seen those sorts of sanctions bring about the entirety of the change in strategy that we'd like to see. Thanks, ENTITY. Is the President aware of the declared mistrial in the case of the South Carolina officer that killed Walter Scott? What is his reaction to that? He is aware of that, Kevin, and the reason I cannot offer you a reaction is that the police officer in question is facing civil rights charges that were brought by the Department of Justice. So there is an ongoing legal proceeding, and I would not want to say something or comment on this situation in a way that could have an impact on that legal proceeding. So the Department of Justice is going to continue to do their work, and that is work that they have done independent of any sort of direction or opinion that has been shared by the President of the United States. Any idea if the President might accelerate the number of commutations between now and the end of his administration? The New York Times had a fairly interesting piece, in one part lauding him for doing something on criminal justice reform that he was not able to do broadly, and yet they also point out that there are thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of people that might be candidates for that sort of special consideration. Kevin, when the President was asked about this question back in August at the Pentagon, he made clear that there is a process that the Department of Justice is administering to consider individually the applications for clemency that have been submitted, and the President does not envision circumventing that process. His expectation, and what we have tried to do particularly over the last year or 18 months, has been to turbocharge that process, to offer more resources to that process, so that it can function more efficiently, and to consider more applications. But I do not envision a scenario in which that process is somehow shortened or that we cut corners in that process so that more individuals can benefit from this clemency. The President believes that rigor being applied to that process benefits the American people and benefits those who are given this special opportunity for a second chance. I know I have asked you previously about the President's comments about Pearl Harbor Day, and I know that there is something scheduled for later in the month. I am just curious, how is he spending this particular Pearl Harbor Day? Is he reaching out to any veterans or doing anything in particular today? I am not aware of any specific actions on the part of the President, but obviously he had an opportunity on Veterans Day, less than a month ago, to travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns, and to restate once again the profound debt that we owe to military veterans of all generations, including the Greatest Generation. And this was a generation that was summoned to action based on the tragic attack perpetrated by the Japanese 75 years ago today. And I think all of us, including the President, have thoughts of deep gratitude for the sacrifice and service of the Greatest Generation of Americans. And the President himself has talked quite a bit about his grandfather who served, I believe it was in the United States Army, in World War II in the European theater. And that is his own personal connection to that generation. And I think all of us, to one extent or another, even though many of them are no longer living, have our own connection to those who served and to those who fought and even those who died in ensuring that tyranny was defeated in World War II. Last thing, I wanted to ask you about welfare reform. House Republicans are said to be considering laying the groundwork for a fresh effort to overhaul the food stamp program and coming up with different work and eligibility requirements. And I ask you that in part because I remember previously this month you talked about the steep decline in the rate of poverty growth in America. And so I am wondering if the White House feels like now is a good time for a fresh look at SNAP. Well, I have not seen the individual proposals that have been put forward by Republicans, so I do not know if I can comment on those specifically. But obviously, there was a government report earlier this year that indicated that poverty in 2015 fell faster in that year than in any year since the 1960s. I think it might be one indication that the anti-poverty economic strategy that President Obama has pursued worked pretty well. And that is true when you consider how significantly poverty has been reduced over the last year. It is also true when you consider how significantly wages for working people have gone up -- the highest on record that same report showed. And wage growth was actually higher for lower- and middle-income families than it was for those at the top. So it is not just that we are reducing poverty; we are actually making some progress in reducing inequality as well. I think it is a pretty good indication that the kind of strategy that we have implemented has worked. And if Republicans want to implement a new strategy, we will see what impact it has. This sort of goes back to what I was saying to Michelle. If Republicans want to try a different approach, we will have an opportunity to see if it works. We will have an opportunity to see -- if by making some of these changes Republicans can further reduce the poverty rate beyond the historic success that we have had in reducing the poverty rate, we will have an opportunity to tell. I am skeptical that they will succeed in doing that, but the American people have given them the opportunity to try. By the measure of success you are saying that it is gone better under the President's program and the poverty rate is not rising at a faster rate -- certainly slower rate than it has in half a century. And I just wanted to throw a couple numbers at you. SNAP apparently serves about 44 million people at the cost of $74 billion. Those are 2015 numbers, but that is up significantly since 2008. So I am just curious if it is going better -- based on your own assessment -- is it now a good time to maybe take a fresh look at programs like these? Well, the President actually in his -- back in January, the President delivered his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, and one area that he identified in that speech was an opportunity to work in bipartisan fashion with Democrats and Republicans on a proposal that Speaker Ryan himself had long advocated, and that was essentially the expansion of tax cuts for low-income workers that do not have kids. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the House did not take him up on that opportunity for cooperation. So I am not suggesting that somehow there are not further improvements that could be made. In fact, President Obama has offered his support for some of the ideas that Republicans have put forward to do that. I do not think that SNAP falls in that category, but I cannot speak at length about the proposal just because I have not seen it. But there certainly are areas where President Obama would -- has already indicated his strong support for some of these proposals that he believes would have a beneficial impact on the economy and would further reduce inequality in this country. ENTITY, I want to ask a couple of questions. First -- and I want to go back to the Trump thing and the phone calls -- how many times has President Obama spoken by phone with President-elect Donald Trump? We played this game a couple times over the last couple of weeks -- It is not a game, I am asking a real question, though. I did not say it was not a real question. What I am telling you is I am not going to get into the details of reading out individual phone calls. So they have spoken several times since their face-to-face Oval Office meeting just after the election, but I do not have a specific number to give you. Okay, well, it is more than twice. We know that. Maybe three or four now? I think he said a handful last time. So I did say a handful last time. I am saying several this time. Two handfuls? I am being intentionally ambiguous. We know it is at least two times. Maybe three, four? April, I would suggest that maybe we pursue a more fruitful line of questioning, respectfully. Respectfully. All right, well, now, on Donald Trump and his comments this morning about how President Obama is a likable sort -- if, indeed, these two would have talked, do you believe -- earlier -- that some of this division, some of these, the thought process and some of the words may not have been used to cause the divide that continues right now in this nation? Do you believe if they had talked prior to the elections that we would not be seeing the efforts to come together because of the comments that were made? Listen, it is difficult to answer counterfactuals because nobody really knows. I think the one thing we do know is that Republicans laid out a very clear strategy on the day that President Obama was inaugurated the very first time, which is to block and obstruct every single thing that he tried to do and to, as much as they could, to try to delegitimize his presidency. That was the strategy that was pursued by Republicans, and they did not succeed in limiting President Obama to one term. In fact, President Obama was not just elected once, but twice, with a strong majority of the American electorate. And that gave him a mandate to go and pursue an agenda that has benefited the American people. And that is everything from strengthening our economy, preventing a second Great Depression, rescuing the American auto industry, to reforming our health care system in a way that ensures every American has access to quality, affordable health insurance and cannot be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. It also gave him a mandate to go and advance our interests around the world, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon by working through diplomacy and not firing a single shot, but actually confronting what most people, including some of our closest allies, had identified as the greatest national security threat that the world was facing. I could obviously go on at some length, and I will stop. But the fact is President Obama has repeatedly sought to work with Republicans, but that ran counter to the political strategy that Republicans laid out to try to block him at every turn and to refuse to cooperate with him even on things they supported. And the country did not benefit from that. But this was a political strategy that has yielded some political benefits for Republicans. And a lot of that is what led to the election of Mr. Trump. But that will be something for historians and others to carefully consider. What I think the President's hope is that what all of you consider as you report on the next administration is to evaluate what impact their changes are having, particularly when you consider the strong trajectory that the country currently enjoys. On your thoughts about Rahm Emanuel in Trump Tower? Listen, there are a number of Democrats that have accepted an invitation from the President-elect to meet with him, and it certainly makes sense that the mayor of the third-largest city in the country might want to have a conversation with the President of the United States. And lastly, going back to what Kevin said about -- more so about the area and what happened -- Charleston, North Charleston area. It was in the news last year. It caused a lot of change in the mind and in the heart and on so many levels -- President Obama, weeks after what happened to Walter Scott, President Obama was there. He preached a sermon for the nine that died in Mother Emanuel church. And now Dylann Roof is -- the jury has been seated in this trial. What does the President say, looking back a year to today, after what happened? And I understand that you cannot say much on the issue that is going to the federal piece. But what does he say about the area and how it made a mark in this nation from that time to today? Well, listen, I cannot talk about the individual cases for the reasons that you cited, but I think both of these cases, just gauging by the news media interest, have captured the attention of people all across the country. And I think all of this debate and examination can sometimes be painful, but ultimately that is the kind of examination and debate that will be required to move the country forward. And the President gave a powerful speech -- a sermon at a memorial service in Charleston about 18 months ago, and that certainly captured the attention of the American people as well. And to the extent that the President was able to contribute to a healthy examination of some of these issues and a healthy debate and discussion and dialogue in this country, he is pleased with that. One example, one manifestation of that is the way that a lot of people reconsidered their view of the confederate flag in light of these issues, in terms of what it symbolizes. That was a healthy thing for that country. But this is going to be part of process. And there is not just going to be one event, or one landmark jury decision, or one heart-wrenching tragedy that is going to solve all these problems. This is going to be a process. And it is going to be a process that the President hopes the country can pursue together -- that the more that we can remember that the differences that unite are more powerful and more influential and more numerous than the things that divide us, that will certainly benefit us as we make our way down this path. And the last question. You say it is going to be a process, and as we go through this transition, I am thinking about that process that you said and what the President said in that sermon that he delivered for Reverend Pinckney. He talked about amazing grace, and he kept talking about grace. Is it about grace, or is it more so about heart, or is it about legislation as we deal with the newness of life for the next couple of months? Listen, I think more grace in our public discourse in every area, not just when it comes to national politics, I think is something that the entire country and all of our citizens would benefit from. Thanks, ENTITY. Going back to Rahm Emanuel at Trump Tower today, we know that he urged the President-elect not to deport DREAMers -- of course, hundreds of young people -- or people who were brought here as children who were covered under the President's DACA program. Even in the past hour, there have been some Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who said they were encouraged by the President-elect's remarks, and people -- I think he said that we have to look at this and take a look at something that will work and that the American people would be proud, according to his words. So is the White House -- this White House -- encouraged by those words as well? Well, listen, the President has been crystal-clear, both in words and in deeds, about his view that young people who are American in every way but their papers should not be deported, should not be ripped away from family members, when the truth is that they came to the United States through no fault of their own. A policy of deporting them would be inconsistent with our values and one that would be a setback for the country, particularly when you consider the remarkable contribution that many of those young people have already made to our country, whether it is by starting a business, or signing up to serve in our military, or otherwise living as upstanding members of communities all across the country. So I cannot speak to what policy the next administration intends to pursue. I think the perspective and values that I have just given voice to are the kinds of values that enjoy strong bipartisan support not just in Washington and not just in Congress but all across the country. And hopefully Democrats and Republicans will be able to find a way to deal with this situation in a way that is consistent with our values, in a way that is consistent with our laws. And if they do, the country stands to benefit not just from a national security perspective, not just from a quality of life perspective, but also from an economic perspective as well. I am sure you would agree, there are a number of people -- undocumented immigrants and people who are covered under the President's executive actions who want to know what is this White House doing? You say you do not know what the next one is going to do, but we want to know what is this White House doing to have an impact and maybe even change some minds or policies from the incoming President? Well, the thing that we certainly have done is we have taken quite seriously the transition process to ensure that the incoming administration understands Well, the thing that we certainly have done is we have taken quite seriously the transition process to ensure that the incoming administration understands what policies we have pursued and why we have pursued them, and what impact it has had across the country. But ultimately, the next President will take office on January 20th. And his policies that will be implemented. Finally, can you confirm a report that the First Lady held a good-bye party for White House staff and brought everyone to tears at a local pizza restaurant? I know there is a lot of good-byes happening over the next few weeks, or 44 days left. Can you confirm that? And were staff -- were they moved to tears? Were you one of them? I was on the President's trip to Florida yesterday, so I did not participate in an event like that. But let me see if I can get you some more information about it, okay? Thank you, ENTITY. Is it still the position of this administration that Assad must go? I know the President said that a few years ago. But does that stand? That continues to be the policy of the administration. And again, it is not just because he stands in the way of a solution -- a diplomatic solution, although he does. And it is not just that we are so offended morally by his willingness to use the military might of his country against innocent civilians. There is also a practical consideration, which is that he has waged war on a substantial number of citizens in his country; his country has been torn apart; he has made it clear that he is unable to lead that country. And in order for us to find the kind of political solution that will bring that violence and chaos to an end, he cannot continue to serve as President of that country. And that is been our policy for years. And it continues to be our policy today. In the statement today, the five or six countries said that there must not be impunity for those responsible. Is that statement specific to Assad? And do you believe that he should face war crime challenges for what he is done? That statement is an indication that there must be accountability, particularly with regard to the kinds of depraved tactics that have been used by the regime against innocent civilians. Accountability in these situations is necessary and consistent with our values as a country. Let me ask you about the Cabinet that is being formed -- not specifically about specific picks, but the fact that there seem to be a large number of generals who have been chosen or who are being interviewed -- the Department of Defense, NSA, now the Department of Homeland Security, and potentially the State Department. Does the White House have any thoughts about the fact that Donald Trump seems to be potentially choosing a Cabinet that is very heavy on retired military? No, just because I do not want to be in a position of criticizing or being -- even appearing to criticize decisions being made by the President-elect. What I will say is that the President spoke as recently as yesterday about the values and leadership qualities that are exhibited by the men and women of the United States military. And many of the people that President-elect Trump has put forward are people that have served this country in the military with distinction. And that is -- even where political differences exist, that service and that commitment to sacrificing for the country are worthy of respect. The President certainly has exhibited that respect. I certainly tried to exhibit that respect. But ultimately, what qualifications and criteria the President-elect wants to use in choosing his Cabinet is something that I will let him decide. Secretary Hillary Clinton is going to be on Capitol Hill for the unveiling of Harry Reid's portrait tomorrow. Is there any chance that President Obama will meet her, speak to her tomorrow? I am not aware that they will meet, but we will keep you posted. I do not think I can commit at this point to announcing that meeting if it does occur. But let me see if I can get you guidance. Thanks, ENTITY. John. Thanks a lot, ENTITY. Since the presidential election four weeks ago, the President has nominated numerous individuals to government boards such as the Surface Transportation Board, Legal Services Corporation, the Kennedy Center Board. Is it the President's expectation that the lame duck Senate will take up these nomination up or down? Well, John, I actually do not know to what extent the individuals that you have named actually require Senate confirmation. But we can certainly have somebody take a look at that for you. Is there an agreement with the Senate Majority Leader that the lame duck Senate will take up various nominations that require Senate confirmation? I do not know what sort of agreements, if any, have been reached with Senate Republicans. We had discussed the benefits of, in a sense, living above the store for the President, the immediacy to a crisis situation where he can meet in the Situation Room with his Joint Chiefs, his security team, members of Congress, et cetera. And the fact that Donald Trump has been choosing to stay -- at least for now -- at Trump Tower, and possibly maybe the first bi-city President, so to speak -- what in a sense -- now that we have a price tag, it is literally costing the American taxpayer and the New York City taxpayer in excess of $3 million a day to keep Mr. Trump safe in the tower. Do you have any additional thoughts about that? I know you made a comment about wherever the President goes, his security team is close by. That is right. Look, over the years I have been in a variety of situations, in a variety of settings where I have fielded questions about criticism from Republicans with regard to the President's travel, and I am not going to give into the temptation to do the same thing to the President-elect. Mark Knoller, you had your hand up earlier. I will give you the last one if you still have a question. You bet I do. Okay. I wanted to ask you to clarify your answer earlier about the waiver for the Defense Secretary. Were you saying the President would not sign a waiver if it reached his desk, that he'd prefer it happen during the new administration? No, I think what I am saying is the short answer to your question is, no, I was not signaling an unwillingness on the part of the President to sign a bill containing such a waiver. I think the observation that I was making is that it seems odd that congressional Republicans would be choosing to sneak a provision in a budget bill to expedite the confirmation of somebody who is a decorated Marine Corps officer, somebody who has served Presidents in both parties, somebody who Democrats and Republicans have spoken warmly of. So I cannot really explain it. I am not indicating that the administration will refuse to cooperate with them. In fact, the principle that I was giving voice to earlier was the idea that Presidents should be given some latitude to choose the people that they want to have on their team. The President was not extended that courtesy consistently by Republicans in the Senate, but it is a principle that the President believes in not just since he is coming in the door, but on his way out the door. And it is one that we will -- that he believes in. So, hopefully -- did that clarify -- You are saying a standalone bill on the waiver is the way to go? Well, I guess I find it strange that Republicans in Congress seem to be taking an unconventional step to avoid the straightforward consideration of this waiver purely on its merits and on the merits of General Mattis's service to the country. So I think it is a question that I am raising that I think is worth asking. But it is one that only congressional Republicans can answer. And I wanted to ask about what the President said yesterday, that it was the last time he was going to hear Hail to the Chief on the road. What does that tell us about travel between now and January 20th? Well, I think it is an indication that the President's travel between now and January 20th is likely to be limited, at least with respect to official events. The President does still intend to travel to Hawaii to spend time with his family there over the holidays. All right? Thanks, everybody. We will see you tomorrow.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjoshearnest10", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-10", "publication_date": "07-12-2016", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Josh Earnest"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 439, "text": "ENTITY, you have often given your views of Nicaragua and called it a war machine and said it poses a threat to its neighbors and, ultimately, to our security. But the Sandinistas appear to be firmly in control, and there are a few signs that they are changing. What-looking back on your policy over the last 4 years-has it actually accomplished as far as Nicaragua is concerned? Well, yes, I think there are more people who are opposing the regime right now in Nicaragua than actually fought in the revolution against Somoza. And it seems to be growing-the unhappiness of the people. You only have to look at the flood of refugees that are escaping from Nicaragua to realize that the people of that country are not happy with that totalitarian regime. With what final result will that- Well, I know the Contadora is still trying to find an answer of that kind. The contras, themselves, have offered to lay down weapons and go into negotiations in an effort to have what they had fought the revolution for, and that is a democracy. And so, I think, as long as the people of Nicaragua are still striving for the goals of the revolution that they themselves fought, I think that we are obligated to try and lend them a hand. In this country, even though your popularity remains very high, on the issue of Nicaragua polls show that there are many Americans opposed to your policy there, and the Congress shows very little inclination to give you the $14 million you have asked. Do you have any new proposals or ideas that would change this view in Congress? Well, nothing that I can talk about here. But let me just say, I know this about what the polls show, and I know what happens up on the Hill. But we have been subjected in this country to a very sophisticated lobbying campaign by a totalitarian government, the Sandinistas. There has been a disinformation program that is virtually worldwide, and we know that both the Soviets and the Cubans have such a disinformation network that is beyond anything that we can match. And, of course, I do not think the people have heard the thing that we are tying to explain of what is going on. People go down, some people, to Nicaragua and claim they come back now with views that are favorable to that totalitarian government. But why do not they go to some of the neighboring countries and talk to the thousands and thousands of refugees and ask them why they fled Nicaragua? Is there anything that you can do as President, that your administration can do, to help the contras and their supporters if Congress does not vote this money? I do not know. That is something I'd have to face if they do this. We are not alone in helping them. As a matter of fact, in spite of the polls, there is more and more private support for the contras. On another subject, sir: Have you heard back from the Soviets on your proposal for a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev? ENTITY, let me just say-and this, I know, will be kind of frustrating-I have had a response to my letter, but I never talk about content of communications between myself and other heads of state. Well, without putting it, then, in the context of a letter, we have heard that the Soviets have given some indication that they would like to meet with you, but they have not given a time and place. Could you- Well, again, as I say, that would be commenting, and that would be opening a door to all kinds of speculation. I wrote, and he answered, and we are in negotiations. And we will just leave it at that. Well, do you expect that you will meet with him sometime? Without reference to the letters, do you foresee a summit meeting or high-level meeting between you and him? Well, I am going to continue-I made it evident, or made it plain, that I would have liked such a thing with his predecessors. But I am going to continue Do you expect hopeful that we can have such a meeting. Has the killing of Major Nicholson 1 had any impact on these negotiations? No. There seems to be a little misunderstanding on the part of some columnists about my answer the other day to that, that it made me even more anxious for a summit meeting. Some have made it seem as if I was being an appeaser or something-not at all. This was a murder, a coldblooded murder; and it reflects on the difference between two societies-one that has no regard for human life and one, like our own, that thinks it is the most important thing. And, yes, I want a meeting even more so-to sit down and look someone in the eye and talk to him about what we can do to make sure nothing of this kind happens again. ENTITY, on a related subject, the Strategic Defense Initiative, you have said that the world would be a safer place if the superpowers moved to strategic defense from mutual assured destruction. But the Soviets do not agree. Does this mean that the present negotiations at Geneva are really on hold until the Soviets come around to your point of view, or is there some way that we can move now to have these talks deal with the immediate questions of medium-range and long-range missiles? Well, I do not think there is any hold on the talks over there. They are in three groups: One group is talking about space and defense weapons; one is talking about strategic weapons; and the third one is talking about the intermediate-range weapons in Europe. And the negotiations are going forward. The Strategic Defense Initiative is purely research. And Mr. Gromyko himself said there is no way to control that, that it is not covered by any treaty. And the plain truth of the matter is, they have been doing the same kind of research in the same areas and started it before we did. Now, I do mean that if this research could lead to the kind of a weapon that would make one have to think twice as to whether they could be successful with the use of nuclear weapons, then it would lead to the very thing that both the late Mr. Chernenko and Gromyko have said, and that is that they would like to see the elimination of nuclear weapons; so would we. And if a defensive weapon that could be successful against them helps bring that about by making them too costly to take the chance of putting those costly things in the air only to be shot down, then we'd be further on the way toward the elimination of nuclear weapons. And we'd all be better off. Do we need an interim agreement to keep the number of missiles down while we are having these talks? Oh, yes. I have never believed that even though they said this, because my own response to Mr. Gromyko, when he indicated that same thing to me-my own response was: Look, we can settle it right here. We are ready to go all the way on the elimination of nuclear weapons. But I did not get an answer. But, yes, I would think that the logical thing would be to start with the reduction of the numbers of weapons, to get them down to a lower level. My hope has been that once we start on that path, that gradually everyone would see that it makes more sense to keep on going until you have eliminated them. Would it be wise to try to achieve that sort of interim agreement about the time when the SALT II limitations would have expired, that have been generally observed by both sides? Oh, I have not really thought about whether that makes any difference or not. It is just that the world is living under a threat; and other people are going to try, as we know, to get missiles themselves. And some of them are less responsible than others, and they are not all superpowers. And I just think that it is a threat that humankind should not have to live under. On another subject, ENTITY, a British newspaper reported yesterday that the United States has warned Iran that military retaliation would take place if any of the Americans who have disappeared in Lebanon were to be put on a show trial or murdered by pro-Iranian factions. Has such a warning been issued to Iran? Well, here again, I do not think I should discuss anything of this kind. What I have said is that there is increasing evidence that some terrorists in the world are actually emissaries of sovereign governments. And if that is the case and can be established, then that business of trying to find and track down, in all the world, a few terrorist individuals for some crime-no, go to the source. And the government supports them, but Would you put Iran in that category of a government that Well, as I say, I cannot comment on this specific question that you asked, beyond that. But we have been working as closely as we can with allied countries and friends to see if together, between us, we cannot do something. And we have done something. I think we have had some measure of success. But in the exchange of information to get a handle on this widening terrorist activity-we know it is not just one group; there are a number of groups representing different interests. Sometimes they apparently collaborate, and it is a new form of warfare. Can you tell us something about the accomplishments in this area that you believe you have achieved? Well, we are making headway and have been successful in getting cooperation in trading information-intelligence information-getting agreements with other countries with regard to extradition and denying their countries a shelter for terrorists who then cross a border and have been in the past reasonably safe if they leave the country where they have been terrorizing. And there is getting to be much more mutual agreement about the need for all of us to work together. ENTITY, on the subject of South Africa, there have been 38 fatalities in civil strikes there in the past few weeks, and the government seems to be engaging in increasing repression, banning assemblies and meetings. Is not it time to go beyond the policy of constructive engagement and silent diplomacy in our dealings with South Africa? We think that what we are doing has the best effect and the most effect of anything that we could do. Just walking away would leave us with no ability to influence them. We think some progress has been made. We do know that there is a factionalism there. It is not just a simple question of two groups-the government versus a group. Over in this group there is a division and there is a sector that wants violence as the answer and are even violent to the others, not to the government alone. And we think apartheid is the main problem that must be resolved, and we are going to continue doing all that we can to encourage the government in its course. Have we done anything to try and discourage that government from this violence? It seems that it is gotten worse rather than better. Except that the violence-nothing can be solved by violence, and that is not the answer. But remember that violence is not just alone stemming from a government put-down of demonstrators. You have in the black community there-you have got rival factions, and the violence is sometimes between them, fighting each other. And we have seen evidence of that, and we have seen murders. And some of the 40 deaths have been created in among the people, without the government participating. When you mentioned that in your recent news conference, some people in this country and around the world took that as condoning the government's actions. Is that- No, it wrong? no, and it was not intended to be. But it is true; I think some people-and I would have to say that some who did maybe have a political bias-but they tried to read into it that I was voicing a bias. And I was not ; I was trying to point out just what I did here. Maybe I should have taken more time. You know, in a press conference you feel a little pressed for time in your answers, and sometimes maybe you do not make them as full as they should be. But I was trying to point out that from this being simply people opposed to apartheid against a government that is supporting apartheid-no, it has gone beyond that. There is an element that wants an overthrow of the government by violence and is not just limiting its fighting to the government. It is fighting its own fellow citizens, and even in the same communities. ENTITY, if we could change a little bit to domestic matters. I wanted to ask you a question about the budget. You said in a Saturday radio speech recently that you would not accept cuts in vital conventional or strategic weapons systems. The Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to cut 175,000 from the Defense payroll and bring down the deficit. Since you do not want to cut weapons systems, would this cut in personnel be acceptable to you? Well, that was not adopted by the Committee, was it? I understand they just sign in to the Committee Well, it is part of an option directed toward zero real growth. Yes. And, no, that is the type of thing I have not had a chance to study-since I heard that also-and see what the effect and where they are choosing these people to go. But, as I have said with regard to defense, when you start to economize, you have to look at it from the standpoint not of the number of dollars that you are hoping to save, but what can you do without. Now, I do not know whether we can do without that many people and where they would come from and what shortages it would create in our defensive capability. So, again, as I say, if we can find additional ways-and we have already reduced the original budget considerably-if we can find additional ways in which there could be some postponements of something or other-not weapons systems-there are a number of fairly civilian-type activities that take place in the military, also. If some of those would not, in any way, reduce our defensive capability and yet would provide some savings to help us as we try to get a handle on this budget-all right, that is one way to look. But I do not see where there could be any compromise on weapons systems that have been chosen, because we believe they are necessary to redress the imbalance between ourselves and the Soviet Union. I have heard some spokesmen, and some who should know better, in and out of government, some of the shows on television, and sometimes in the newsprint, voicing their opinions that somehow we are on a parity-they have even used that term-with the Soviet Union. This is the most ridicuENTITYs thing I have ever heard. The Soviet Union virtually outnumbers us in any type of weapon you want to name, has consistently modernized their land-based nuclear missiles, where we are just trying to with the traumatic experience of the 21 these last few days-which is the first modernization of our land-based missiles in almost the lifetime of the men and women who are handling these weapons. They are about 3 to 1 in megatonnage, nuclear megatonnage, over us. They outnumber us in conventional weapons in almost every category. Their navy has several hundred more ships than we have. We have been making progress. We think that we have achieved, I think, a deterrent to the effect that they'd have to think twice about taking us on. But we have not caught up with them or surpassed them in any sense. Turning to trade with Japan, you have expressed your sympathy with Prime Minister Nakasone's problems in trying to open up markets there. Nevertheless, it appears that the negotiations continue to be very difficult with Japan, particularly on telecommunications most recently. Are you satisfied, after the report from your special envoy, that some sort of agreement can still be reached, or do you think you are going to face an increasingly frustrated Congress on this issue? Well I am going to place my confidence in Prime Minister Nakasone-and confidence that he wants to arrive at a solution to these trade problems as much as we do. And, of course, just as I do, he is got some political problems of his own. But our representatives came back, and they are reassured that there is no lack of intent on his part. And they are assured that he is going to continue doing his utmost to bring about some changes, evening up this trade imbalance. And, so, we just have to wait and see what he can accomplish. We have made some progress so far and some time ago with regard to citrus fruits, beef, things of that kind. And the negotiations are not over by any means. ENTITY, for a long time you have been theoretically strongly committed to the idea of free trade. Will you make an active effort to try and oppose the protectionist legislation that now appears to be building in the Congress? Yes, I will, because protectionism, if you go back over the years-all of you have only read about it-but the Great Depression, I think the Great Depression was extended and carried on and worsened because of a tariff situation on our part, called Smoot-Hawley, that reacted unfavorably against us. It was supposed to be protectionist. But protectionism is a two-way street. And it may be that here is an industry that is suffering from, let us say, some unfair competition. What we are trying to cure is unfair competition, to see that the markets are free to each other, both ways; that we are not competing with subsidized products, government subsidized and so forth. And all of these things we are doing our best to change. But in normal competition and international trade, to set down here a restriction that is based on some import in our country from another, they, then, may retaliate and affect another industry of ours. So, to help one industry by protectionism when you cannot help all the others that are our exporters-and what is going to happen to them at the other end? We saw a little example or an example of that-not exactly in this sense, but-in the grain embargo. We lost a market, and we lost a recognition of us as a reliable trading partner in doing that. ENTITY, you said in your last news conference that you did not want to visit Dachau during your upcoming European trip because of an unnecessary guilt feeling that you said has been imposed on the present-day German people. How do you respond to those American Jews who have interpreted this remark as minimizing the Holocaust and as passing up an opportunity to dramatize this idea of never again ? Well, ENTITY, here again is one that maybe-well, no maybe about it-I guess I should have elaborated more in my answer. I have made it very plain and spoken publicly on a number of occasions, and will continue to say, we should never forget the Holocaust. We should never forget it in the sense that this must never happen again, to any people, for whatever reason in the world. What I meant-and this time, to be a guest in that country at this particular time, when it is the coincident date with the end of the war, and recognizing that most of the population there-I grant you, there are some people there my age who remember the war and were participants in it on that side-but the bulk of the population, you might say everybody below 50 or 55, were either small children or not born yet. And there is no question about their great feeling of guilt-even though they were not there to participate in it-of what their nation did. And then to take advantage of that visit, on that occasion, to go there-I just think is contrary to what I believe. We should all start recognizing the day of the end of the war as and make it more of a celebration of the fact that on that day, 40-odd years ago, began the friendship that we now know 40 years of peace between us. And at the same time, you can say: And let us keep it this way and never go back to that other way. And it just seemed to me that it would be just out of line to emphasize that when I was there, as a visitor in their country. I am supportive of the Holocaust Museum; I have done everything I can to be supportive of that. And I will say anytime that anyone wants me say it, as publicly as I can, that, no, we must never forget that chapter in this history of humankind and our determination that it must never happen again. ENTITY, on tax reform, Secretary Baker is at work, as you know, trying to come up with a revised proposal. And you have frequently talked about your desire to lower individual tax rates, yet the first Treasury plan envisioned a higher corporate tax burden. Are you willing to accept higher burdens on corporations as a tradeoff for lower burdens on individuals? Well, no, the corporate tax was going to be cut even lower than the top personal rate in their plan. What we are talking about is generally more money from the corporate sector, but by way of broadening the base-that the rates would be lower for everyone, but there would be an end to some loopholes that probably were never intended to allow large profit-making corporations to escape totally tax free for years on end. And it would simply mean that there'd be more fairness, that you'd know that your neighbor was paying a tax, too, and not getting off scot-free. So, you would envision, as a result of this effort, both lower corporate and individual rates, and all the revenue that is lost made up entirely by base-broadening efforts. Yes. There is no question the plan calls for a 33-percent top rate instead of 46 for the corporations, and then it calls 50, 25, and 15 for the-or, I mean 35, 25, and 15, instead of the 50 and other 13 tax brackets for individuals. So, no, we do not want to penalize some taxpayer into paying a higher share by way of higher rates. We want all the rates to be lower, but, as I say, close those loopholes that have permitted this thing of very profitable businesses not paying any tax. There'z- Got time for one more question? Yes. ENTITY, you said at St. John's last week-I know you were in a lighter mood-but you said to the students that you are not a young man anymore. Now, you are a person who has always celebrated you own vitality, and I guess I wanted to ask you whether you feel yourself aging or growing any older in this job. No. Do I look older? I do not feel any older. No, I feel fine. And, no, I think maybe part of it, ENTITY, is that there've been a lot of people that have sat at that desk and have come from, let us say, different experiences in government-by the way of the legislature, for example. I have to believe that 8 years as Governor of the most popuENTITYs State in the Union, California, was a pretty good foundation. In other words, I did not find things too different. I'd had 8 years of dealing with many of the same problems. Granted, we did not have a foreign policy in California, but I think that this is part of it. For 8 years somebody handed me a piece of paper every night that told me what I was going to be doing the next day. And when I became Governor, I had something of the same problems in California that we had here. I came in in the middle of the fiscal year-you do not quite come in in the middle here; you only come in 4 months into it; you have got 8 months to go on the other fellow's budget-but middle of the fiscal year and with already a deficit that had been piled up in California. And the difference there-and I wish I had it here-the difference there was that-but in the 6 months remaining to me in that, when I took office, of the budget-that first budget-I had to balance the budget, which was one of the reasons why, in contrast to everything I'd said in campaigning, I had to go for a tax increase, because when July 1st came, that budget had to be balanced. But I promised the people that as soon as we could, we'd give it back, and we did. You know that. Every time we got to the place where it was surpluses, not deficits; and every surplus, we gave back to the taxpayers. --our last question, Dave or Lynn, do you have a question? Well, ENTITY, speaking of the balanced budget, you apparently or reportedly got very upset at a Congressman who said that he asked you if you want a balanced budget, why do not you submit one. Well, I'd like to ask you, what was your response to that question? That it was the most hypocritical question I'd ever heard.. Why did you say that? What? Well, there is a member of a party that for 50 years, with only a couple of years' exception, 2 or 4 years' exception, has been responsible for the government spending-the Democratic Congresses of the past 50 years-and we have had deficit spending for 50 years and a trillion dollars piled up in national debt before we got here. That for someone now to suggest-when they themselves have refused to give me the cuts I asked for-to suggest that I should have asked for so many more cuts, that we had a balanced budget all at once-no; it is hypocritical. He knows and everyone knows there is no way that you could pull the rug out from so many people by trying to balance this budget in one term, in one year. The people have become accustomed for a half a century to many of the things that government is doing. So, you have got to warn them that down the road here it is not going to be doing some of these things. And you start us on a downward path of reducing the deficits to where you can point to a time reasonably certain and say, Here is where we can reach the balanced budget. And this is our goal. But for him, as a member of the body that has refused to give me the cuts that I asked for ever since I have been here-if they'd given us the cuts in 1981 that we asked for, the budget deficit would be $50 billion less than it is today. And then for him to say, Why do not you submit a balanced budget? -Yes, I told him that, in no uncertain terms, how I felt", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithloucannondavehoffmanandlynndowniethewashingtonpost", "title": "Interview With Lou Cannon, Dave Hoffman, and Lynn Downie of the Washington Post", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lou-cannon-dave-hoffman-and-lynn-downie-the-washington-post", "publication_date": "01-04-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 269, "text": "I want to welcome all of you to the White House. Some of you have been here before. I think you have had a chance to meet with some of our staff this morning. And I hope that the day will be fruitful for you. One of the most important things to me as ENTITY is to have a means by which I can understand the problems and the questions that arise throughout the country-sometimes removed from Washington itself -to get a different perspective and also, of course, during my news conferences, that have been held and will always be held, I hope, twice a month, to receive questions from the Washington press corps. The number of issues that confront me are very voluminous. I'd just like to outline a few of them for you in preparation for your questions. This morning I concluded my own talks with the Prime Minister of France, and this is a final meeting with him. He will now, this afternoon, meet with economic advisers, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and others so that we, in shaping our own policies for the future, will know the special problems of France, and vice versa. These discussions which I have had with many foreign leaders have been very helpful to me. As you know, I have never served in Washington before January. I have got a lot to learn about the processes, and I have gone out of my way this year to expand my own circle of knowledge outside just domestic issues. Last week, I met with, I think, 19 heads of state of the Latin American countries. And I think we have a new relationship with them, brought about primarily by the prospect of the ratification of the Panama C. anal Treaty. We are continuing our negotiations with the Soviets on the SALT question; also, on a comprehensive test ban of nuclear weapons. And as you know, the Soviet Union in addition is a cochairman, along with us, of the Mideast talks that we hope will take place before the end of this year. This coming week, I will have the first of a series of foreign ministers who will come and meet with me from the Middle Eastern region Foreign Minister Dayan from Israel. And during the following weeks, I will meet with all the others. These meetings that come to me directly are preceded, of course, by long discussions with the Secretary of State and others. We have, in addition, many other defense matters that have come to my desk. Quite often, we have foreign matters that do not relate to the prospect of war or the issue of peace. A recent one, concluded last week, was with the Canadians, on a means by which we might bring natural gas down to our country. And this is the biggest construction project ever undertaken in the history of the world, and I think we arrived at a common purpose there. We have already implemented the construction of a new Department of Energy. I approved it this week. Dr. Schlesinger has been working on this ever since I have been in office. We have finished in the House, I think, substantial legislation to set up an energy policy that might guide the new Department in its functions. We are running into additional problems in the Senate. The political pressures are enormous from the oil companies and others on the subject of energy. I think the House took very courageous action in this respect, and my hope and expectation is that the Senate will do the same. Welfare reform has been presented to the House and to the Senate this week in its final, legally drafted version of legislation. And before the Congress adjourns this year, hopefully in October, I will present to them my tax reform package as well. This will take a great deal of debate and study, along with welfare. And that, obviously, cannot be concluded during this calendar year. We have, I think, been fairly successful so far. We have been learning, and I think that we put together a good organization here. I have obviously been concerned recently about the Bert Lance case, and I have not let it interfere with my own functions. I do not think Bert has let it interfere with his functions as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. This is an agency with which I am most intimately involved, personally, on a multiple basis every day. And because of my own engineering background and my habits acquired while I was Governor, I set very specific and rigid time schedules for the accomplishment of each component part of a major undertaking. And I can assure you that there has been absolutely zero slippage in the Office of Management and Budget because of this series of allegations that are now being answered by Bert Lance to the Senate I hope, successfully. We have initiated this year and this is the last point I will make a brand new budgeting system that I used in Georgia, called zero-based 'budgeting. It is a massive undertaking for a bureaucracy of our size to completely change its mechanism by which next year's budget will be prepared. But the fiscal year '79 budget will be prepared in its entirety using the zero-based budgeting technique, where you do not make any assumptions that present programs or expenditures are sacred. You do not just deal with the new additions next year for the budget considerations, but you start from zero and analyze the entire appropriation of funds. The reorganization effort is on schedule, and I think by the end of the 3-year period that is been given me by the Congress, we will complete it to the satisfaction of the people of our country. I will be glad now to answer any questions that you might have. ENTITY, you say you read the editorials, so I might as well get what is coming to me. We are very well aware of your concern for the need for fairness to Mr. Lance, and you are respected for that by the people who support you the most; those same people are the most concerned about the success of your Presidency. And on another issue, recently you remarked that life is not always fair. I wondered if you are confronted with the problem of whether a resolution may be necessary which is not altogether fair to Mr. Lance, but which is necessary for the larger concerns of the Presidency? Yes, that is something I will have to balance. And as I said yesterday in a telephone talk to the news programers of television and radio stations, I do not know of anything illegal that Bert Lance has done. I do not know of any unethical conduct on his behalf. And I am keeping an open mind about this entire subject until the Senate goes through its present procedure of analyzing in detail all of the new charges and allegations and claims and statements that have been made about Bert Lance. He is now being given a fair chance to say these are all of the charges, this is my answer to them. And of course, I will certainly have an eagerness to learn of any reason for me to change the assessment that I have just made. But I want to be fair about it, and I have a sure sense of the basic fairness of the American people. The facts, if divulged, will be conclusive, I think, in the shaping of public opinion. And one problem about the whole incident that I cannot comprehend, perhaps, adequately, is let us leave Bert Lance out of it for just a moment; just take any of you, or myself. If a series of, say, incorrect allegations are made day after day after day with the highest possible publicity, the lead story on every television network every night and the headlines in the Washington Post and other newspapers every day, and then all those allegations are proved to be false, how much of those allegations remain to damage the character of the person who might be totally innocent? And then you say, well, this person is damaged so that he cannot perform his functions adequately, when the damage has been caused either erroneously or falsely. Well, if that was the only factor, then my decision would be easy. But if I also have confidence that as the American people learn and it might take a while that the allegations were basically false and have successfully been answered, that the character of the person, say, yourself, would be restored, then my decision would 'be a different one. And I really have been concerned about this matter, as you know. I do not know an easy answer. But at this point, I have no evidence to indicate that Bert's done anything illegal or unethical. I wish that every one of you could read the FBI report which has been the subject of many references. Bert has an ability, under the law, to get the FBI report under the Freedom of Information Act and make it public. They interviewed, I guess, a hundred people three of those people were in the Comptroller's Office; three additional ones were in the Department of Justice. And the FBI questioned them about these same allegations, and the response of those, I think, all men, six men, were unanimously almost effusive in their recommendation of Bert. But now their testimony under the pressure of Senate interrogation is a little bit different. But at the time that the Senate investigated first, I think the information was offered to them. Obviously, a lot of new questions have been raised. But in general, I am still keeping an open mind about it. ENTITY, I am from New England, and we do not engage in overdrafts, as Mr. Lance calls some of his actions. When you were a businessman in Georgia, did you ever become involved in overdrafts? He gives the impression that it is a common practice in the State of Georgia. There are several people here, I think, from Georgia. I do not think that this is - But did you, in your business Well, I cannot say that I depended on overdrafts to run my business, but as I have said in one of my regular news conferences that was televised nationwide, yes, I have had overdrafts. Let me add one other thing. There is a fairly common practice and I am not trying to criticize banks, because I do not know how wide the practice is-but there is a general sense at home, not because it is in the South, but because I live in a small town, that if you have several accounts and a substantial balance in all those accounts, but then you become overdrawn in one of those accounts, then that is not considered to be an illegal or an unethical act. I run, I would say in my business, six or seven individual accounts, different aspects of my farm or my warehouse business. Also, I have a personal account. I never write any checks. I have not written three checks in the last 5 years. My wife does all the check writing. But if we should have $50,000 or $100,000 in my warehouse account, and in my own personal account my wife should buy a dress and give a $25 check to pay for it and the check bounced 'because we were overdrawn, they would not send for the sheriff or call me on the phone to say, You have disgraced yourself by having an overdraft. They would say, in effect, We will honor this check. We will put a notice in your mailbox, and then you can shift some money from your warehouse account over into the personal account. But I do not excuse overdrafts. You know, it is obvious that I would rather my own life have been completely free of any overdraft. But I cannot say that it is an acceptable thing. But I still do not believe that it is an unethical or illegal thing in the banking circles in which I have had to operate. ENTITY, people in the Northeast are as concerned about energy as anything. I know that Secretary Schlesinger yesterday told the Senate Finance Committee that he was not sure how you were going to react to the idea of diverting the wellhead tax to energy production rather than tax rebates. I wonder, can you tell us today how you feel about it? My preference is to have the wellhead tax receipts go to tax rebates. There are some alternatives that obviously will .be considered by the Congress with or without my approval, and I cannot say that my own position will prevail ultimately. But there are different ways to use wellhead taxes. My preference is, as we presented it to the Congress, the rebates. One reason for that preference is that it is fair. Another one is that it does not create a tremendous withdrawal from the national economy of substantial amounts of money. If you have increased wellhead taxes and immediately return that money to people in better paychecks on a 2-week basis, then there is not a shock to the country. If you withdraw that money and wait 3 months, 6 months, or a year before it gets back into the economy, you have a tremendous dampening effect on our national economy, which is bad. Now, if some of the wellhead tax should be shifted to enhance the effectiveness of the energy goals, then I cannot see anything very bad about that. If you had better rapid transit systems, better insulation of homes, more research and development, for instance, for new energy sources, that would be one thing. But the constant threat is that because of political pressures, that money is going to be returned to the oil companies under the guise of enhancing production. I think the oil companies have enough cash flow right now certainly the majors do to have an adequate degree of exploration. In fact, that exploration, in my opinion, is adequate at this point. And I am just as afraid that there is a threat that the wellhead tax is going to be given to the oil companies to reward them financially. I think that our package has a gracious plenty of incentives for enhanced exploration and enhanced production of oil in this country. We have by far the highest price for newly discovered oil in this energy package of anywhere on Earth, and I do not think the oil companies deserve to get this money taken out of the consumers' pockets and put in the pockets of the oil companies. Sir, in light of the fact that many people are having a hard time affording a home these days and some are depending, apparently, on the mortgage tax deduction which you have proposed to eliminate or reduce, do you have any idea what the impact is going to be? Have you done any studies on whether this is going to be preventing many people from buying homes? In the first place, I have not decided on any specifics of a tax reform package at all. I have certainly not decided on eliminating credits for interest paid on homes or property taxes paid for homes. During the political campaign, I promised that there would not be a reduction in the stimulus for American families to own their own homes, and if there should be any change it would be compatible with that commitment of mine. Now, I have some doubt about whether this same level of interest rate deduction should be applicable to a $500,000 home or a second or third or fourth home for very wealthy families, as contrasted with the average American working family who is trying to pay for one home in which they live. Also, you have to remember that if the credit is on a percentage basis, then a family that has a $15,000 income, if given a certain amount of credit for interest, only gets, say, 20 percent of that interest payment credited on their tax. But if you are in the 70-percent bracket, you get 70 percent of any interest that you pay on your home. So, equalizing those homeownership credit incentives is part of the package. But it will not hurt the average family in trying to purchase or pay for their own dwelling place. What limit do you propose, sir? I do not know the specifics yet. ENTITY, do you think Bert Lance has strengthened or weakened his position since yesterday morning? I have not had a chance to watch the television programs, except that my staff puts together an 18- or 20-minute recap on some of the highlights. And I see those on occasion. I spent all yesterday and today in my regular business and meeting with Prime Minister Barre. But my assessment from the brief time I have watched it, and also from my own staff, is that he has enhanced his position, because he was in a situation where, literally, for weeks, all kinds of allegations or charges were made, including criminal violation of the writing of checks to avoid paying of taxes, which is fraudulent and illegal. He was alleged to be an embezzler by a convicted felon. And on that basis, the chairman and the minority leader of the Senate had called for his immediate resignation, and he had not had a chance to answer those charges. Now that he has answered the charges I hope and believe successfully I think he is certainly enhanced his position. ENTITY, I am from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Buenas tardes. Muchas gracias. Would you object to a U.N. fact finding team going to Puerto Rico to look into the idea, the charges that have been raised, that we are a colony of the United States? Yes, I would object to that. I do not have any objection to any analysis of the question, but I think my own statement and the statement of all the leaders of our country that whatever Puerto Rico's people want t do is acceptable to me. If the Puerto Rican people want to be a commonwealth, I will support it. If the Puerto Rican people want to be a State, I will support it. If the Puerto Rican people want to be an independent nation, I would support it. But the U.N. has no jurisdiction? I do not think the U.N. has any jurisdiction. And particularly when this question is raised by Cuba, a government that has no respect for individual freedom or individual liberty and permits no vote of any kind in their own country, to accuse us of trying to subjugate the people of Puerto Rico, to me, is absolutely and patently ridiculous. Are you planning a trip down that way or the Caribbean way in the Latin American trip? I would like to come down there as soon as I can. An important goal of my administration is to build up a renewed understanding and trust and communication with the nations and the people who live south of here in our hemisphere. My wife's already visited seven nations, as you know. She is coming to San Juan in 2 weeks? Yes, she is coming there in 2 weeks to make a speech to a news group. In addition to that, Andy Young has been down to visit several of the countries in the South. Assistant Secretary Todman has been down. Very shortly, I think next month, the Secretary of State will come down to Latin America. And I hope to come, too. I do not have any specific date yet. ENTITY, you mentioned the pipeline from the North Slope. The Governor of our State, California, Governor Brown, has been running around saying that you have given California a finger instead of a leg regarding the western leg that goes into California. Would you comment on that? Well, I would like to say one thing to start with, that the people of California are my constituents just as much as they are the Governor's constituents, and I have just as deep a concern about the future prosperity and good life of the people of California as the Governor or anyone else. I have never had any disagreements with Governor Brown. So far as I know, he is never mentioned the western leg of the pipeline to me. If he corresponded with some of my staff members and I am not familiar with it, then, of course, that would be understandable. I have been with him several times this year, both in California, and he spent a night with me at the mansion. We have had long discussions, but I did not know he was dissatisfied with the arrangement at all. One of the problems, however, with the El Paso route, which was the alternative, was the reluctance of California to provide some means by which oil or natural gas could come into the State to be used there and also to be transported to other parts of the country. I do not say that in a spirit of criticism, because I am concerned about environmental questions and possible oil spills and, also, the deterioration in the quality of air, because of heavy shipping transport, as well. But I would expect that Governor Brown and I and other State and Federal officials would eagerly search for a basis on which we could assure California adequate energy supplies in the future. My decision to go with the Alcan route was one of great importance to our country. But certainly none of the factors involved was to damage California people whom I care about very much. ENTITY, I appreciate the honor of being here and meeting you. I have been an admirer of yours. The one thing that concerns me and, I think, concerns you and the country, is the tax reforms that are getting into the magazines, et cetera. You see what is happening to the stock market. I, like you, was a poor boy in Washington that became affluent. Now, I do not like to see small business which, I believe I read in Fortune, contributes 90 percent of the gross national product-now, where you make statements that capital gains might go to 50 percent, more social security taxes to a small businessman, it is killing the American incentive. And I do hope that you will give it serious thought to keep venture capital going, not for the big corporations. We support the big corporation. Well, one of the major Considerations in evolving the tax reform package is obviously to provide adequate incentive for business expansion. And I believe that when the tax reform package is made public, that there will be a sigh of relief and also a removal of the inevitable uncertainty about what the terms of the tax proposal might encompass. Also, of course, through long weeks of House and Senate hearings, any possible improvements on the tax reform package would be explored. We have met with many leaders I have personally representing small businesses, large businesses, the professions, labor, consumers, tax experts, in trying to evolve a good package. And I think it will be good. We hope that there will be equity. We hope that there will be a reduction in tax rates. We hope that there will be simplicity, and we hope that we can provide an adequate assurance of improved venture capital in the future. And we hope that there will be substantial tax reductions. Those are about five factors that I hope will be in the tax reform package and which I can predict to you with great assurance will be in the tax package. With the 15-percent tax investment credit, you cut the unemployment rate to 4 percent. That sounds very good. ENTITY, do you plan to withdraw your nomination of Don Tucker to the CAB, and do you think the Lance matter has hurt that? I have not any intentions to withdraw the nomination. I understand that there has been some concern raised within the committee. I have not received e that I did not that report; I have just read about it in the news. But I will look into it, and if there are some provable allegations therknow about when the recommendation was made, then I would certainly reconsider. But I do not have any intention now, knowing what I know, to withdraw the recommendation. Don Tucker is speaker of the house in Florida. He is been recommended strongly by the two Senators in Florida. He is been recommended strongly by Governor Reubin Askew from Florida. And I do not even know what the reason for the hesitancy in the Senate staff is at this point. ENTITY, during the House-Senate conference committee on this year's agriculture act, an administration spokesman said he felt that tariffs should be used or tariffs would be used to maintain the price of sugar, rather than a price support program of Government subsidies. Yesterday, Secretary of Agriculture Bergland announced that a payments program, very similar to the one declared illegal by the Comptroller General, was going to be proposed. Why are you insisting on Government subsidies rather than tariffs or import restrictions to support the price of sugar? And, secondly, do you think that sugar prices should be supported at all? Yes, I think that sugar prices ought to be supported. I think that a 13 1/2-cent sugar price is about the minimum that would be advisable, both for domestic producers and also for imported sugar. We have supported the new farm bill which provides price supports until the international sugar agreement can be implemented. I did this reluctantly, as you may know. We did not support the de la Garza amendment in its original form and-accepted it only if the conferees would agree that the price support mechanism would be terminated at the time an international sugar agreement was reached, if the international sugar agreement encompassed a price of about 13 1/2 cents. Tariffs are a terrible thing to impose, because many of .our friends in Latin America depend heavily upon sugar. One of the most democratic nations in the world derives almost its entire income from the export of sugar. And for us to put an obstacle to their shipment of sugar to our country would, I think, almost destroy their economy, their government, probably shift it toward a complete dependence on totalitarian assistance and would not be fair, as well. We have tried to avoid a protectionist policy since I have been in office. And I think the best way to do it is through international agreements that, in effect, set minimum and maximum prices for commodities whose prices, without constraint, fluctuate so wildly. We have seen this happen in the case of coffee. We have seen it happen in the case of sugar, where it went almost up to a dollar and then dropped down to about 8 cents. Well, we can accommodate that. It is devastating to a sugar farmer or to the sugar producers, but our national economy is so varied that we can accommodate it. But for a country where 85 percent of all their exports is sugar, this is devastating. So, I do not like tariffs as such. They would particularly be damaging to our closest friends and allies in this hemisphere. They also, I think, would cost the American taxpayer a great deal more. And I think that an international agreement on sugar of about 13 cents would be the preferable approach, and until that can be put into effect, I have reluctantly agreed to support the price support aspects of the new farm bill. ENTITY, Jim Wisch, with the Texas Jewish Post, Dallas and Fort Worth. First of all, on behalf of the American Jewish Publishers Association, I want to thank you for the profound message you sent from your wife, Rosalynn, and yourself to the American Jewish community. It was indeed very sincere. And with regard to your sincerity, which was recognized by all editors across the country, regardless of their background, I want to point up to you your profound statement on the Mideast which we published right before the election, which was highly informative and set out many things that you had proposed to do. I just returned from the Mideast, where I had a long, long conversation with Ambassador Lewis. And it seems to me there is a great deal of apprehension going on amongst American Jews and Jews of the world, and somehow it rests upon what some of your decisions are going to be. I think this apprehension could be cleared, because I think there may be a disagreement, perhaps, in semantics rather than in objectives. And I wonder if you had been concerned about your popularity or your interpretation vis-a-vis your embracement of the PLO, and that your regard for them has given them a propaganda ploy where they have become recalcitrant they still employ Chapter 16, the complete destruction of Israel. Now, people think that you are pushing Israel to sit down and recognize the PLO, regardless of that point in the PLO's platform. 242, your resolution, which you so eloquently described last July, says that nobody can sit down unless it is a face-to-face discussion and they recognize the entity of each nation as being a sovereign nation like we are doing with Panama. And in view of this regard, I wonder if you plan to clear this up or elucidate or however you plan to handle this. With all due respect, that is one of the most distorted assessments of my own policy that I have ever heard. It is not my assessment I understand. But it is incumbent upon me to bring it to you. I have never endorsed the PLO. Our Government has had no communication, at all, directly with the PLO. The only communication has been when representatives of the PLO have been to Arab leaders immediately prior to a Cy Vance visit with them or their visit to our country and have delivered messages to us indirectly. Our agreement with the Israeli Government several years ago, before I became ENTITY, was that we would not communicate with the PLO as long as they did not refute their commitment to destroy the nation of Israel and did not accept the right of Israel to exist. Our public position is the same as our private position. There is no difference between them. We have said that if the PLO would accept publicly the right of Israel to exist and exist in peace, as described under United Nations Resolution 242, that we would meet with them and discuss the future of the Palestinians in the Middle East. We have never called on the PLO to be part of the future negotiations. We have said that the Palestinian people should be represented in the future negotiations. That is one of the three major elements of any agreement that might lead to lasting peace one is the territorial boundaries; the other one is the Arab countries accepting Israel, to live in peace as neighbors; and the third one is some resolution of the Palestinian question. I have never called for an independent Palestinian country. We have used the word entity. And my own preference as expressed in that talk that I made in New Jersey, I think, and now, is that we think that if there is a Palestinian entity established on the West Bank, that it ought to be associated with Jordan, for instance. I think this was the case among many Israeli leaders as their preference in the past. So, we have been very cautious, very careful, very consistent in spelling out our posture on the Middle Eastern settlements. When we have gone around, for instance I have not , but Cy Vance has gone around to Israel, to Jordan, to Syria, to Egypt, to Saudi Arabia to talk about a future Middle Eastern conference and, hopefully, a settlement, we have taken the same exact written set of principles so there would be no difference among them, and discussed it with Sadat and Hussein and Asad and Fahd and with Mr. Begin, so that there would never be any allegation on any part of theirs that we took one position with the Israelis and a different position with the Arabs. Sometimes the Israelis would say, We do not accept this principle number 4. Sometimes the Arabs would say, We do not accept principle number 1. But we have tried to negotiate in good faith. I might say one other thing. We are not just an idle bystander. We are not just an uninterested intermediary or mediator. Our country has a direct, substantial interest in a permanent peace in the Middle East. And I sincerely hope and I believe that the nations who live there also want to have a permanent settlement and a permanent peace in the Middle East. And the principles that I described in that speech, the principles that the Vice President described in a speech he made in California earlier this year, and the principles that we espouse in our public and private conversations with Arabs and Israelis and with Prime Minister Barre, yesterday, from France, and others who are interested, are exactly the same. We have never deviated. We have learned a lot. And as we have learned, we have added additional new items onto our basic proposal. But ultimately, the Middle Eastern settlement has got to be an agreement among the parties involved. Now, I hope that all the countries are eager to negotiate in good faith. I hope that none of them are putting up deliberate obstacles to prevent a Geneva conference from being convened. That is my hope and that is my present expectation. Thank you, sir. I am sorry that I have to leave. I have enjoyed it.

{"id": 552, "text": "Hello again, George is off today, it is great to have you with us. In a This Week exclusive, ENTITY is standing by to join us live, but first, a major political story breaking overnight. A new report from USA Today with what the paper says is a draft of the White House immigration proposal. According to the report, the plan includes allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for legal status with a pathway to citizenship after eight years. It also expands e-verify and border security. Joining us now to talk about this is the new White House Chief of Staff ENTITY. Thank you for joining us. Thanks for having me, Jon. Now, this hit with a thud as far as Marco Rubio is concerned. He said late last night in a statement, quote, this legislation is half baked and seriously flawed. It would actually make our immigration problems worse. If actually proposed, the president's bill would be dead on arrival in Congress, leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for years to come. Let us be honest. There is no passing an immigration bill without Marco Rubio. How could the White House be working on a draft without Republican input? Jon, you know, the president has always approached this question of immigration reform from four principles. One, let us make sure that the border is secure. Two, let us make sure that we enforce on businesses who are gaming the system, enforce their requirements to live up to the law. Three, make sure that we are reforming legal immigration so that we can use it to make sure that those who have come here legally have a reasonable option. And we have not proposed anything to Capitol Hill yet. We have got a bill, we are doing exactly what the president said we would do last month in Las Vegas, which is we are preparing. We are going to be ready. We have developed each of these proposals so we have them in a position so that we can succeed, because fact of the matter is, Jon, as you know as well as I do, going back to 2001, this has been a priority for many Congresses. So let us make sure that they get this thing done. And they are up there working on it right now. Senator Rubio, Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer and others. And let us see how they do, and we will be ready to work with them. But back to my question here, how could the White House be working on a draft -- even if it is a White House draft -- without at least talking to Republicans about it? I mean, has the president even met with Marco Rubio yet on immigration? Well, we are talking with all the parties to the gang of eight effort in the Senate. Jon -- He says there is been no consultation. We have been working with all the members up there. We have our staff working this very aggressively with their staffs and with the members, and we are working this very aggressively, as you think we would with such a high priority for the country. This immigration system is broken. Border security, we have made great progress for the last four years. We want to build on that. And we are going to continue to work with Senator Rubio and others on this. But he says it is dead on arrival if it is proposed. Well, let us make sure that it does not have to be proposed. Let us make sure that that group up there, the gang of eight, makes good progress on these efforts, as much as they say they want to, and that is exactly what we intend to do, to work with them. So what do you say to Marco Rubio on this? I mean, he is saying half-baked, flawed. What do you say to him? How do you do some damage control on this? Well, I am not going to get engaged in that kind of a back and forth as is often the practice here in Washington, a big kind of political scrum, even before we have had actual proposal of-- It is already here. He started it. Right, I mean-- Well, look, I am not going to engage, as I said, in some kind of back and forth. What I am going to do is make sure that our team is doing exactly what the president has demanded us to do, and what he said to the country in the State of the Union the other night, which is we have to make progress on immigration reform. We should enact this this year, and the president will continue to work with the team to make sure that happens. OK, I want to move to the other big battle you have coming up right now with Congress. The so-called sequester, these automatic spending cuts. We have heard some dire warnings about what they would mean. We have heard 70,000 kids kicked off Head Start, the equivalent of 1,000 FBI agents off the job, the Navy shutting down four air wings, delaying the deployment of a carrier striker to the Persian Gulf, and we have even had a senator talk about five-hour wait times at airports if these cuts go into effect. So tell me straight with me, how bad will it be if it happens? Well, you did not even raise the thing that concerns the president most about the sequester, which is we have seen pretty good economic activity over the course of the last several months. The housing market is healing. The stock market is coming back. You have seen consumer confidence restored. So the lens through which the president looks at this fight, Jon, is a lens that says, are we doing everything we can in this country to strengthen middle class families? That is how our country, our economy is strongest, when a thriving, rising middle class is the engine for growth in this economy. That is exactly what we want to do. When you look at sequester, the impacts on middle class families, what is it going to be? Teachers in schools, 13,000 schools are going to be-- 13,000 teachers are going to be hit, 6,000 schools. If you look at mental health, if you look at food inspections -- and you have already heard the devastating list of horribles that the Pentagon has said are going to be out there. So the question is, on top of all those things that you just talked about is what is the impact on the middle class? So the question the president is asking is why do not we take a step back, let us fix this in a kind of balanced way the president has proposed and the Senate Democrats have proposed, with a reasonable amount of spending cuts and a reasonable amount of revenue raisers so that we can get this thing done and move on to the business of the country. But help me understand, because we have a budget. This is -- let us look at exactly what this is. $85 billion this year out of a budget of $3.8 trillion. You can see just the small slice, and then if you look at the sequester over 10 years, we are talking about 1.2 trillion out of $47 trillion in projected government spending. Is it really impossible to find less than 3 percent of savings in a federal budget without making those kind of horrible cuts? You know what, it is not impossible, and that is exactly what the president has done over the last year, $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction. He is ready to do another $1.5 trillion to get up to the $4 trillion target that economists across the country tell us is needed to stabilize the debt over the next 10 years. So that is exactly what the president has done, working with Democrats and Republicans. But you are going to insist on tax increases, right? Well, we are going to insist on doing this in a balanced way-- Which means tax increases. A way that -- we are going to insist on doing this in a balanced way. A way that allows us to maintain the kinds of investments that middle-class families in this country rely on, Jon. We were just talking about our families, our kids. You know what, we are not going to put at risk the education investments in this country because we cannot get together to resolve this in a balanced way. This is not an ideological effort, Jon. This should not be a social science experiment. This should be a question where we ask ourselves, what is most important to the economy, what is most important to the middle class families of this country, and that is the way the president is going to do this. OK, we are almost out of time. Very quickly, two other things. Yes. Chuck Hagel, the nomination delayed, also CIA director, your nominee, John Brennan, looks like he will be delayed. Is this a threat to national security? It is a grave concern. If you look at Chuck Hagel, decorated war veteran himself, war hero. Republican senator. Somebody who over the course of the last many years, either as a Republican senator or as the chairman of the president's Intelligence Advisory Board, I have worked with very closely. This guy has one thing in mind, how do we protect the country. Is there a danger of this being delayed? Between John Brennan, CIA director, and Chuck Hagel as second of defense, we want to make sure that we have our -- those guys sitting in the chairs working, because I do not want there to have been something missed because of this hangup here in Washington. OK, and very quickly, John Boehner had a very -- seemed like a harsh comment directed toward the president, saying that quote, I do not think he has the guts to cut or to deal with the entitlement problem. He do not have the courage to take on the liberal side of his own party. What do you say to the speaker of the House, John Boehner? In the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, the president laid out a very detailed plan to get to the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that we need to stabilize debt, grow the economy, strengthen the middle class. That is exactly what he is done. That takes on his party, and asks the Republicans to do a little bit too. And that is what we are going to continue to do. All right. ENTITY, brand-new White House chief of staff. Thank you for coming here on This Week. Thanks so much for having me, Jon. And now, in a This Week exclusive, ENTITY joins us from Janesville, Wisconsin. ENTITY, thanks for coming to the show. Hey, good morning, Jonathan. I want to get right to this dustup over immigration and Marco Rubio's comments. Just last week, you said that the president deserved credit for not politicizing the immigration issue. You thought that was a good sign. Do you still believe that? Actually, I do not , and I really do not enjoy saying this. I did think that his words were measured and productive in the State of the Union. But putting this -- leaking this out does set things in the wrong direction. Look, the question that we always have to ask ourselves, particularly with this White House, is the president looking for a partisan advantage or is he looking for a bipartisan law? And by putting these details out without a guest worker program, without addressing future flow, by giving advantage to those who cut in front of line for immigrants who came here legally, not dealing with border security adequately, that tells us that he is looking for a partisan advantage and not a bipartisan solution. There are groups in the House and the Senate working together to get this done and when he does things like this, it makes that much more difficult to do that. And that is why I think this particular move, very counterproductive. Well, let us be clear. You have said that you would support an immigration bill that included a pathway for citizenship, correct? Yes, look, absolutely because we think that is -- there is a way to do this through earned legalization without rewarding people for having come in with undocumented status, illegally. We do not want to give them an advantage over those who came here legally and we think there is a way to do this while still respecting the rule of law. It is clear that what the president is talking about does not do that. I have a long record of immigration reform. I am not a Johnny-come-lately on this issue. We have always believed that there is a way of doing this while respecting the rule of law, that is the delicate balance that needs to be achieved for this to be bipartisan and the president on most of these issues and this one now, like the others, seems to be looking for a partisan advantage and not bringing the parties together. Well, let us get to the biggest other issue out there right now which is these automatic spending cuts. You have been pretty clear. You have predicted for some time that you think that this so-called sequester is going to happen. Let me ask you this, congress is now on recess for ten days, the president is playing golf in Florida this weekend. Is there really any everyday underway to try to avert these cuts right now? Are you even trying. Well, there have been from the House Republicans. Let us take a step back. Do not forget it is the president that proposed the sequester and designed sequester and House Republicans who twice passed legislation replacing the sequester with smarter cuts in other areas of government. OK. The Senate has not passed a bill to replace the sequester. The president gave a speech showing that he'd like to replace it, but he has not put any details out there. So that is why I conclude I believe it is going to take place. But take a step back. We are here because the president back in the last session of congress refused to cut spending in any place and therefore we wound up with the sequester. But ENTITY, I have heard you say this and a talking point for Republicans for a long time. This was the president's idea on and on and on, but let us look at your own words. What you said right after the law putting this in place was passed in August of 2011. These are your words. You said what conservatives like me have been fighting for, for years are statutory caps on spending, literally legal caps in law that says government agencies cannot spend over a set amount of money and if they breach that amount across the board sequester comes in to cut that spending. You cannot turn it out without a supermajority. We got that into law. Now it sounds to me there like if you were not taking credit for the idea of the sequester, you were certainly suggesting it was a good idea. So those are the budget caps on discretionary spending. Those occurred. We want those. Everybody wants budget caps. The sequester we are talking about now was backing up the super committee. Remember the super committee in addition to those caps was supposed to come up with $1.2 trillion in savings. The Republicans on the super committee offered even higher revenues in exchange for spending cuts as part of that. It was rejected by the president and the Democrats. So no resolution occurred and therefore the sequester is occurring. And what we have always said is let us cut spending in smarter ways to replace this sequester. We passed two bills doing that and we have heard nothing in response from the Senate Democrats or the president. Now... We did not pass anything. And the point I am trying to say is, when you have no budget passing the Senate for four years, when the president is going to be about a month late in proposing his budget, there is no leadership on the other side of the aisle and therefore no agreement. Now, wait a minute. Two points, first of all, actually House Republicans have not acted in this congress. You know, you did in the last congress those bills are dead. No, in this congress... So why have not you even tried to pass... In December we passed it again, that is right. OK. So now we have... Please say that again. Well, now we have the Senate Democrats on Friday did come out with a plan to replace these cuts. It is half spending cuts and half tax revenue increases. What do you make of that Democratic plan? Well, first of all I'd be curious to see if they could actually pass that, number one. Number two, the president got his tax increases last year. He got those higher revenues. He was able to tax higher income individuals. But taking tax loophole, what we have always advocated is necessary for tax reform, means you are going to close loopholes to fuel more spending not to reform the tax code. What is the goal that we are trying to achieve here? We want economic growth. We want job creation. We want people to go back to work. We want to prevent a debt crisis from hurting those who are the most vulnerable in society from giving us a European-like economy. In order to do that, you have got to get the debt and deficit under control and you have got to grow the economy. So if you take tax loopholes to fuel more spending, which is what they are proposing, then you are preventing tax reform, which we think is necessary, to end crony capitalism and to grow the economy. So very quickly, though, you are body... So that is why we think we need to cut spending to pay for this. But your bottom line. Yes, our bottom line is cut spending to pay for this, that is right. And you are saying no tax increases, period, to pay for this. That is a right, that is right because revenues, loopholes are necessary for tax reform. If you take them for spending, you are blocking tax reform and you are really not getting the deficit under control. OK, now, the next big thing here is you -- the speaker has said you were going to come out with a balanced budget that is going to balance the budget in ten years. Your last budget did not balance until well after 2030. So this is a wig, new step. Some in your own party are a little worried about this. Mike Simpson, Republican congressman from Idaho said we are saying a ten-year balance. That is tougher than the last ENTITY budget. There could be a significant number of Republicans that say, I am not going there because it would be too dramatic. How are you going to balance the budget in ten years? What further things are you going to cut that you did not last time? Well, we will show you when we finish writing the budget. We have not literally finished writing it. We have just begun because we just now got our baseline. So I cannot answer the question since it is not a complete task. But I am very comfortable with the fact that we will pass this. I am very comfortable with the fact that we will produce a budget that balances. Our last budget balanced. It just balanced a little later. This one will balance on time because we have new numbers to work with from the Congressional Budget Office that I think will make it easier for us to balance. And, look, the point also is this, we are producing a budget. We are going to be passing a budget.The Senate has not passed a budget for four years. The president has never proposed ever to ever balance the budget. That is wrong. The reason we want to do this is not simply to make numbers ad up, we want to prevent a debt crisis, we want to grow the economy, we want to get people back to work in society and if we have a debt crisis, that is bad for our economy today. OK. And let us never forget we are robbing from future generations. We have got to address that. We are almost out of time. I have got to ask you about this new effort from Karl Rove to weed out what he is calling problem candidates and Republican primaries. One conservative talk radio host said of this effort we are now at the point where you are almost better off in the Republican Party being endorsed by Barack Obama than Karl Rove. He is the reverse Midas. Now I might note, by the way, that Karl Rove has recently called you one of the most remarkable political talents in America. But putting that aside, do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing to have a, you know, big Washington power broker trying to get in there and meddle in Republican primaries? You know what, Jonathan, I do not even pay attention to this stuff. I am too busy trying to do my job. I am too busy rising to put a budget together a budget that balances, to grow the economy, to create opportunity, to get bipartisan immigration reform. I really do not pay attention to this. So I have no thoughts on the matter whatsoever. No thoughts whatsoever. OK, before you go you know I have to ask you about your future. There was an article in Politico by my friends Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei about your political future saying you are less inclined to run for president. And this quote caught my eye ENTITY will never say he is not running for president because the constant speculation carries too many advantages, said a longtime friend. He will keep answering the questions in a way that will keep nosy political reporters interested.: Now, ENTITY at risk of being a nosy political reporter here, is it true, are you considerably less likely now to run for president in 2016? Actually, Jonathan, you have known me a long time and the one thing you know about me is I do not play that game. I do not talk like that. So when you see these articles that are really not accurate, that is par for the course in Washington these days. The point is this, I think the most important thing for me to do is do my job representing the first district of Wisconsin, trying to prevent a debt crisis, helping get a solution to the economy, to jobs, to getting our deficit and debt under control. That it me is my first priority. That is what I am focused on. Will I or will not I? I do not know. I literally do not know the answer to these questions about what is the best role for me to play to fix these problems for our country in the future. The point is I do not know the answer because I am just not putting a great deal of thought into it.I am not foreclosing any opportunity. I may or a I may not. I just do not know because right now we just had an election. We have got jobs to do. What bothers me is this permanent campaign the president has us in. We need to start thinking about doing our jobs after these elections than thinking about the next election. All right. That is the problem we have in Washington. Unfortunately we are out of time but I am going to take that as a definite maybe. Thank you very much, ENTITY. All right. Appreciate your time.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "abcnewsgocomPoliticsweektranscriptreppaulryanwhitehousechiefstoryid18515489", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Rep.

{"id": 252, "text": "Forty years ago, Harry Truman, who was staying at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here in New York City, decided to take a morning stroll down West 49th Street. There, the story goes, he noticed a group of onlookers watching the Today show through its street-level glass window. He decided to join the crowd, and thus this unusual picture. Today, minus the stroll, we are pleased to welcome another ENTITY to our street-level digs. ENTITY, good morning. Welcome to Studio 1A. Good morning, ENTITY. I wish I were with Harry Truman today, out there on the street, looking in. Well, ENTITY and I are very grateful that you are allowing us the opportunity to interview you this morning. Thank you for taking the time. Let us start with North Korea, if we might. Former President Jimmy Carter, just back from the Korean Peninsula and meetings with Kim Il-song, has said that he believes the crisis has been defused and at this point any sanctions would be counterproductive. Do his opinions reflect the views of your administration in any way? And if not, could you detail the extent to which his views and his trip may have changed your approach? Well, the North Koreans asked President Carter to come as a private citizen. He called me, and we agreed that the trip might be productive, that he would go, he would listen, he would faithfully state the views of our administration and reaffirm that our interest is in seeing that North Korea honor its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its commitment to a nonnuclear Korean Peninsula. While there, when he notified us about what they were saying, we put out a statement, which he reaffirmed, which simply said that if North Korea wishes to talk and is willing to freeze their nuclear program, that is, not continue reprocessing or refueling while they talk, then that would be a step forward. He says that Kim Il-song made that commitment to him. Now we have to verify that. So that is the question. We have, surely, something to gain by talking with the North Koreans, by avoiding further steps toward a crisis. But we have to know there is been a change. So we will be looking to verify that. And that is really the question. This is a question of fact now. There are some hopeful signs, the willingness to meet between North and South. But the critical question is, are they willing to freeze this nuclear program while we try to work these differences out? You say there are hopeful signs. Are you prepared to respond with positive signs of your own, or have you reason to believe that Kim Il-song's history suggests there is a wide divergence between what he says and what he does? Well, I think what we have to do is to look to the present and the future and say we will evaluate words in terms of actions. We have the capacity, if the international inspectors and the equipment are going to be left there, to evaluate whether, in fact, the nuclear program has been frozen. If it is going to be frozen, then clearly that is grounds for talking. But we have to know what the facts are, and we will be attempting to determine that. ENTITY, moving to matters closer at home now, yesterday on Meet the Press Senator Moynihan, chairman of the Finance Committee, said that there was no chance that Congress will pass a health care plan that will give all Americans immediate insurance coverage. If that, in fact, is the case, will you accept a plan that will provide universal coverage somewhere down the road? Well, ENTITY, our plan required a phase-in. It is going to take some time for the States and for others who would have to provide the insurance who do not now to phase it in. But I think the important thing is that we should not walk away from this Congress without a commitment to cover everyone. The so-called 91 percent solution, if it is a permanent solution, essentially would guarantee what we have now. The poor would get health care; the wealthy would get health care; the middle class would be at risk of losing it. One in ten Americans would not have any health care all the time, and others would be losing it. Keep in mind, we now have 3 million more Americans without health insurance than we had 3 years ago. The situation in terms of coverage is getting worse, more and more middle class Americans at risk. All I want to do is to give the American people what the President and the Congress and the Federal Government employees have. And my proposal would cost small businesses much, much less than the last minimum wage increase that President Bush signed. Now, I admit that we needed to make some changes in our original proposal. I always said we would. We want it now to be less bureaucratic and less regulatory, and the proposals are. They reflect some changes that we have agreed to. But we have to cover all Americans. And that is the real issue. So you are saying some of the bills that are being discussed in Senate Finance which will provide insurance coverage for 91 percent, that if those bills, or a bill like that comes to your desk, you will veto it? What I am saying is I do not think it will come to my desk for the simple reason that if you look at what the bill does, the bill that covers 91 percent of Americans, the proposal would cost middle class taxpayers more tax money, essentially subsidize low-income people, and leave middle class workers either without health insurance or at risk of losing it because of all the problems we have in the system today. So I really do not believe it is a solution. I know that there had been tens of millions of dollars in special interest money spent to convince the American people that our plan is wrong. I know that we needed to make some changes in our plan. But I also know that the right thing for America is to do what every other advanced country has done in guaranteeing middle class working people health care that cannot be taken away. When Harry Truman stopped by the Today show 40 years ago and looked in at Dave Garroway who, by the way, was the first fellow I ever saw that wore a bow tie, so I remember this very well he knew that. And they beat him to pieces over health care. And they drove the popularity of his proposal down. And he was never able to pass it. But Harry Truman was right then, and we are right now. The right thing for America's values, for work, for family, is to provide health care for all Americans. It does not have to be done tomorrow. It ought to be phased in over a period of just a few years. But we ought not to walk away without a bill that provides health care to all Americans. ENTITY, let us turn to Haiti, if we could for a moment. It is being reported in this morning's paper that your administration is trying to induce Haiti's three top military leaders to leave Haiti for a comfortable life in exile, perhaps by managing somehow to pay them off. Is that something that is being pursued? And if you can get them to leave Haiti, are you at all interested in bringing them to justice after that? We have always said, if you go back to the beginning of this administration, that we had no interest in trying to persecute anybody. President Aristide himself agreed on an amnesty proclamation as part of the agreement we had last year. The military leaders broke that agreement. We are still looking at any number of options to try to restore democracy to Haiti so that that troubled country can begin to have some economic growth and the people who have been so oppressed by the military dictators can escape their oppression. So we have a number of options under consideration. What happens to those who violate the law, I think, depends in part on what the democratic government decides to do. But President Aristide all along has said that he was interested in honoring the original conditions of the Governors Island Agreement. It was the other side which broke them. Well, we propose to make up that difference in two ways: first of all, by raising the cigarette tax and, secondly, by achieving other savings in Government programs. Then we ask the very biggest businesses in the country, who are going to get a big reduction, most of them, from our health care plan because we are going to spread the cost more evenly throughout the country, to pay a small amount of money into a program that will support the subsidies for small business and continuing medical research. This will work because of the competitive pressures to hold health care costs down if we get everybody in the system. That is, I think that it is hard for most Americans to realize this, but we are already spending about 40 percent more of our income, as a percentage of our income, than any other country on Earth. And yet we are the only country that does not require everybody to have some health coverage. So it seems to me that the simplest way to do it is to just take the system we have, which is an employer-based system that over 80 percent of the Americans are covered by, and just extend it to everybody. But in order to do it, because we have so many small employers, you have got to give them a discount. And I would not do this in this way if I were not convinced that it would help the economy in the medium term and over the long term. We cannot do anything that will run unemployment up. This will balance out the scales, in my judgment, and help more small businesses create jobs. Keep in mind, most small businesses are giving health insurance now and paying 35 percent or 40 percent more than bigger business and Government. And as a consequence, that undermines their ability to compete. They cannot get fair rates. And the proposal we have, I will say again, will cost small business considerably less than the minimum wage increase that President Bush signed a couple of years before I became ENTITY. That is a great town. That is a decision for her to make. But I will bet you she would like to welcome you here at the White House. I am trying to work out an opportunity to welcome my 30th high school reunion class to the White House as well. I think both of us would like that very much. And I will tell her that you asked. I am sure I hope she is watching this morning, but I will tell her. And I will bet she would love that. . ENTITY, let me close, if I could, with one that is not a national issue but one I am sure you have some feelings on. The entire country, as you know, watched the O.J. Simpson drama unfold last week. What are your own personal thoughts about the fall from grace of such an American hero? Well, it is a genuine tragedy. In some ways it is a story as old as time; in some ways it is a modern story. It is of course the biggest tragedy because two people were killed. Children were robbed of a mother, a family's lost loved ones, and a man widely admired in this country is now caught in the web of a terrible tragedy. But I have to say that, after we all watched it in excruciating detail last weekend, the time has now come for the legal process to take its course. I think the less the rest of us say from now on in until the legal process takes its course, the better. ENTITY, we thank you very much for taking the time to be with us Thank you. helping to christen our new studio. We appreciate it and hope you will come back. Next time ENTITY, come here to New York and see us. Oh, I'd like that. I'd like to be looking I'd like to be on the outside looking in, asking you questions. For a change, I guess, right? That is right.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithkatiecouricandbryantgumbeltoday", "title": "Interview With Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel on Today", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-katie-couric-and-bryant-gumbel-today", "publication_date": "20-06-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 271, "text": "General Royall, Mr. Trippe, Mr. Rockefeller, General Clay, gentlemen. I feel tonight somewhat like I felt when I addressed in 1960 the Houston Ministers Conference on the separation of church and state. But I am glad to have a chance to talk to you tonight about the advantages of the free enterprise system. Less than a month ago this Nation reminded the world that it possessed both the will and the weapons to meet any threat to the security of free men. The gains we have made will not be given up, and the course that we have pursued will not be abandoned. But in the long run, that security will not be determined by military or diplomatic moves alone. It will be affected by the decisions of finance ministers as well as by the decisions of Secretaries of State and Secretaries of Defense; by the deployment of fiscal and monetary weapons as well as by military weapons; and above all by the strength of this Nation's economy as well as by the strength of our defenses. You will recall that Chairman Khrushchev has said that he believed that the hinge of world history would begin to move when the Soviet Union out-produced the United States. Therefore, the subject to which we address ourselves tonight concerns not merely our own well-being, but also very vitally the defense of the free world. America's rise to world leadership in the century since the Civil War has reflected more than anything else our unprecedented economic growth. Interrupted during the decade of the thirties, the vigorous expansion of our economy was resumed in 1940 and continued for more than 15 years thereafter. It demonstrated for all to see the power of freedom and the efficiency of free institutions. The economic health of this Nation has been and is now fundamentally sound. But a leading nation, a nation upon which all depend not only in this country but around the world, cannot afford to be satisfied, to look back or to pause. On our strength and growth depend the strength of others, the spread of free world trade and unity, and continued confidence in our leadership and our currency. The underdeveloped countries are dependent upon us for the sale of their primary commodities and for aid to their struggling economies. In short, a prosperous and growing America is important not only to Americans it is, as the spokesman for 20 Western nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as he stressed this week, of vital importance to the entire Western World. In the last 2 years we have made significant strides. Our gross national product has risen 11 percent while inflation has been arrested. Employment has been increased by 1.3 million jobs. Profits, personal income, living standards all are setting new records. Most of the economic indicators for this quarter are up and the prospects are for further expansion in the next quarter. But we must look beyond the next quarter, or the last quarter, or even the last 2 years. For we can and must do better, much better than we have been doing for the last 5 1/2 years. This economy is capable of producing without strain $30 to $40 billion more than we are producing today. Business earnings could be $7 to $8 billion higher than they are today. Utilization of existing plant and equipment could be much higher; and if it were, investment would rise. We need not accept an unemployment rate Of 5 percent or more, such as we have had for 60 out of the last 61 months. There is no need for us to be satisfied with a rate of growth that keeps good men out of work and good capacity out of use. The Economic Club of New York is of course familiar with these problems. For in this State the rate of insured unemployment has been persistently higher than the national average, and the increases in personal income and employment have been slower here than in the Nation as a whole. You have seen the tragedy of chronically depressed areas upstate, of unemployed young people, and I think this might be one of our most serious national problems, unemployed young people, those under 20, one out of four is unemployed, particularly those in the minority groups, roaming the streets of New York and our other great cities, and others on relief at an early age, with the prospect that in this decade we will have between 7 and 8 million school dropouts, unskilled, coming into the labor market, at a time when the need for unskilled labor is steadily diminishing. And I know you share my conviction that, proud as we are of its progress, this Nation's economy can and must do even better than it has done in the last 5 years. Our choice, therefore, boils down to one of doing nothing and thereby risking a widening gap between our actual and potential growth in output, profits, and employment-or taking action, at the Federal level, to raise our entire economy to a new and higher level of business activity. If we do not take action, those who have the most reason to be dissatisfied with our present rate of growth will be tempted to seek shortsighted and narrow solutions to resist automation, to reduce the work week to 35 hours or even lower, to shut out imports, or to raise prices in a vain effort to obtain full capacity profits on under-capacity operations. But these are all self-defeating expedients which can only restrict the economy, not expand it. There are a number of ways by which the Federal Government can meet its responsibilities to aid economic growth. We can and must improve American education and technical training. We can and must expand civilian research and technology. One of the great bottlenecks for this country's economic growth in this decade will be the shortage of doctorates in mathematics, engineering, and physics; a serious shortage with a great demand and an under-supply of highly trained manpower. We can and must step up the development of our natural resources. But the most direct and significant kind of Federal action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in private consumption and investment demand to cut the fetters which hold back private spending. In the past, this could be done in part by the increased use of credit and monetary tools, but our balance of payments situation today places limits on our use of those tools for expansion. It could also be done by increasing Federal expenditures more rapidly than necessary, but such a course would soon demoralize both the Government and our economy. If Government is to retain the confidence of the people, it must not spend more than can be justified on grounds of national need or spent with maximum efficiency. I shall say more on this in a moment. The final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963. I am not talking about a quickie or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking. In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the Federal Government's most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures. Under these circumstances, any new tax legislation and you can understand that under the comity which exists in the United States Constitution whereby the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives have the responsibility of initiating this legislation, that the details of any proposal should wait on the meeting of the Congress in January. But you can understand that under these circumstances, in general, that any new tax legislation enacted next year should meet the following three tests: First, it should reduce net taxes by a sufficiently early date and a sufficiently large amount to do the job required. Early action could give us extra leverage, added results, and important insurance against recession. Too large a tax cut, of course, could result in inflation and insufficient future revenues but the greatest danger is a tax cut too little or too late to be effective. Second, the new tax bill must increase private consumption as well as investment. Consumers are still spending between 92 and 94 'percent of their after-tax income, as they have every year since 1950. But that after-tax income could and should be greater, providing stronger markets for the products of American industry. When consumers purchase more goods, plants use more of their capacity, men are hired instead of laid off, investment increases and profits are high. Corporate tax rates must also be cut to increase incentives and the availability of investment capital. The Government has already taken major steps this year to reduce business tax liability and to stimulate the modernization, replacement, and expansion of our productive plant and equipment. We have done this through the 1962 investment tax credit and through the liberalization of depreciation allowances two essential parts of our first step in tax revision which amounted to a 10 percent reduction in corporate income taxes worth $2.5 billion. Now we need to increase consumer demand to make these measures fully effective demand which will make more use of existing capacity and thus increase both profits and the incentive to invest. In fact, profits after taxes would be at least 15 percent higher today if we were operating at full employment. For all these reasons, next year's tax bill should reduce personal as well as corporate income taxes, for those in the lower brackets, who are certain to spend their additional take-home pay, and for those in the middle and upper brackets, who can thereby be encouraged to undertake additional efforts and enabled to invest more capital. Third, the new tax bill should improve both the equity and the simplicity of our present tax system. This means the enactment of long-needed tax reforms, a broadening of the tax base and the elimination or modification of many special tax privileges. These steps are not only needed to recover lost revenue and thus make possible a larger cut in present rates; they are also tied directly to our goal of greater growth. For the present patchwork of special provisions and preferences lightens the tax load of some only at the cost of placing a heavier burden on others. It distorts economic judgments and channels an undue amount of energy into efforts to avoid tax liabilities. It makes certain types of less productive activity more profitable than other more valuable undertakings. All this inhibits our growth and efficiency, as well as considerably complicating the work of both the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service. These various exclusions and concessions have been justified in part as a means of overcoming oppressively high rates in the upper brackets and a sharp reduction in those rates, accompanied by base-broadening, loophole-closing measures, would properly make the new rates not only lower but also more widely applicable. Surely this is more equitable on both counts. Those are the three tests which the right kind of bill must meet and I am confident that the enactment of the right bill next year will in due course increase our gross national product by several times the amount of taxes actually cut. Profit margins will be improved and both the incentive to invest and the supply of internal funds for investment will be increased. There will be new interest in taking risks, in increasing productivity, in creating new jobs and new products for long-term economic growth. Other national problems, moreover, will be aided by full employment. It will encourage the location of new plants in areas of labor surplus and provide new jobs for workers that we are retraining and facilitate the adjustment which will be necessary under our new trade expansion bill and reduce a number of government expenditures. It will not, I am confident, revive an inflationary spiral or adversely affect our balance of payments. If the economy today were operating close to capacity levels with little unemployment, or if a sudden change in our military requirements should cause a scramble for men and resources, then I would oppose tax reductions as irresponsible and inflationary; and I would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase, if that were necessary. But our resources and manpower are not being fully utilized; the general level of prices has been remarkably stable; and increased competition, both at home and abroad, along with increased productivity will help keep both prices and wages within appropriate limits. The same is true of our balance of payments. While rising demand will expand imports, new investment in more efficient productive facilities will aid exports and a new economic climate could both draw capital from abroad and keep capital here at home. It will also put us in a better position, if necessary, to use monetary tools to help our international accounts. But, most importantly, confidence in the dollar in the long run rests on confidence in America, in our ability to meet our economic commitments and reach our economic goals. In a worldwide conviction that we are not drifting from recession to recession with no answer, the substantial improvement in our balance of payments position in the last 2 years makes it clear that nothing could be more foolish than to restrict our growth merely to minimize that particular problem, because a slowdown in our economy will feed that problem rather than diminish it. On the contrary, European governmental and financial authorities with almost total unanimity, far from threatening to withdraw gold, have urged us to cut taxes in order to expand our economy, attract more capital, and increase confidence in our future. But what concerns most Americans about a tax cut, I know, is not the deficit in our balance of payments but the deficit in our Federal budget. When I announced in April of 1961 that this kind of comprehensive tax reform would follow the bill enacted this year, I had hoped to present it in an atmosphere of a balanced budget. But it has been necessary to augment sharply our nuclear and conventional forces, to step up our efforts in space, to meet the increased cost of servicing the national debt and meeting our obligations, established by law, to veterans. These expenditure increases, let me stress, constitute practically all of the increases which have occurred under this administration, the remainder having gone to fight the recession we found in industry mostly through the supplemental employment bill-and in agriculture. We shall, therefore, neither postpone our tax cut plans nor cut into essential national security programs. This administration is determined to protect America's security and survival and we are also determined to step up its economic growth. I think we must do both. Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions, and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now. The experience of a number of European countries and Japan have borne this out. This country's own experience with tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus. I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut deficit and a budgetary surplus. It is between two kinds of deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy; or a temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and achieve and I believe this can be done a budget surplus. The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and weakness; the second reflects an investment in the future. Nevertheless, as Chairman Mills of the House Ways and Means Committee pointed out this week, the size of the deficit is to be regarded with concern, and tax reduction must be accompanied, in his words, by increased control of the rises in expenditures. This is precisely the course we intend to follow in 1963. At the same time as our tax program is presented to the Congress in January, the Federal budget for fiscal 1964 will also be presented. Defense and space expenditures will necessarily rise in order to carry out programs which are demanded and are necessary for our own security, and which have largely been authorized by Members in both parties of the Congress with overwhelming majorities. Fixed interest charges on the debt also rise slightly. But I can tell you now that the total of all other expenditures combined will be held at approximately its current level. This is not an easy task. During the past 9 years, domestic civilian expenditures in the National Government have risen at an average rate of more than 71/2 percent. State and local government expenditures have risen at an annual rate of 9 percent. Expenditures by the New York State Government, for example, have risen in recent years at the rate of roughly 10 percent a year. At a time when Government pay scales have necessarily risen and I take New York just as an example when our population and pressures are growing and the demand for services and State aid is thus increasing, next year's Federal budget, which will hold domestic outlays at their present level, will represent a genuine effort in expenditure control. This budget will reflect, among other economies, a $750 million reduction in the postal deficit. It will reflect a savings of over $300 million in the storage costs of surplus feed grain stocks, and as a result of the feed grain bill of 1961 we will have two-thirds less in storage than we would otherwise have had in January 1963 and a savings of at least $600 million from the cancellation of obsolete or unworkable weapons systems. Secretary McNamara is undertaking a cost reduction program expected to save at least $3 billion a year in the Department of Defense, cutting down on duplication and closing down nonessential installations. Other agencies must do the same. In addition, I have directed all heads of Government departments and agencies to hold Federal employment under the levels authorized by congressional appropriations; to absorb through greater efficiency a substantial part of this year's Federal pay increase; to achieve an increase in productivity which will enable the same amount of work to be done by fewer people; and to refrain from spending any unnecessary funds that were appropriated by the Congress. It should also be noted that the Federal debt, as a proportion of our gross national product, has been steadily reduced in this last year. Last year the total increase in the Federal debt was 2 percent compared to an 8 percent increase in the gross debt of State and local governments. Taking a longer view, the Federal debt today is 13 percent higher than it was in 1946, while State and local debt increased over 360 percent and private debt by over 300 percent. In fact, if it were not for Federal financial assistance to State and local governments, the Federal cash budget would show a surplus. Federal civilian employment, for example, is actually lower today than it was in 1952, while State and local government employment over the same period has increased 67 percent. It is this setting which makes Federal tax reduction both possible and appropriate next year. I do not underestimate the obstacles which the Congress will face in enacting such legislation. No one will be satisfied. Everyone will have his own approach, his own bill, his own reduction. A high order of restraint and determination will be required if the possible is not to wait on the perfect. But a nation capable of marshaling these qualities in any dramatic threat to its security is surely capable, as a great free society, of meeting a slower and more complex threat to our economic vitality. This Nation can afford to reduce taxes, we can afford a temporary deficit, but we cannot afford to do nothing. For on the strength of our free economy rests the hope of all free nations. We shall not fail that hope, for free men and free nations must prosper and they must prevail. Thank you. There has been much talk in Washington and elsewhere of reductions in personal income tax rates to 15 percent for the lowest brackets, and 65 for the highest brackets, in personal income taxes, and for a reduction in corporate rates to 47 percent. What many of these questioners would like to know is, are those figures generally in the ball park? This legislation is going to have very difficult traveling at best, and I would suggest giving it at least the most favorable start we can, as I said in my speech, by permitting Mr. Dillon to present this before the Ways and Means Committee in January. So that I would suggest that the details of the tax reduction should wait upon presentation to the Ways and Means Committee. There might be something for everybody, though. ENTITY, my first question is: One of the great achievements of your legislative program this year was the passage of the Trade Expansion Act would you care to comment on your program in that area of the economy? We have, as you know, appointed former Secretary of State Herter to be our chief negotiator. He is assisted by Mr. Gossett, who was Vice President of the Ford Company. They will begin the discussions with the Common Market early in 1963. There are fourteen or fifteen hundred items. It will probably take well into 1963 I would say towards the end of '63 before both sides have prepared their positions. We are going to have an extremely difficult negotiation, particularly in agriculture. The United States has had a favorable market for its agricultural surpluses to Europe or its agricultural products; it has been our best dollar earner, it has really meant that our balance of payments has not been in more difficult position than it has been. Now, with the Common Market, with the prospect of Britain's joining, with the tremendous revolution in agricultural production which is about to hit Europe-France in particular the levies and the rates and the penalties which are placed on the introduction of agricultural commodities into Europe in the coming 3 or 4 months may be of decisive importance to us in our battle on the balance of payments, and also in our struggle to bring some sense out of the problems we face in American agriculture. So I would say that Secretary Herter has really a responsibility comparable to what he had as Secretary of State, and one which ties into our security, because quite obviously unless we are able to meet our balance of payments in time, then we are going to have to find other means of solving it. As you know, it costs us about $3 billion a year because of national security expenditures. So that this goes to the heart of our ability to keep more than one million Americans in uniform who now are serving the United States outside the borders of the United States. So that I think this is a very vital issue, and that is why I was particularly pleased that Mr. Herter accepted it. I am glad to see in this New York Port Authority, the trade center that they are building, the effort that businesses are making to sell abroad. We still sell abroad much too little. As a percentage of our gross national product the United States sells abroad less than really almost any major industrialized country. We have never had before us the prospect of export or die, and I think that if all those who are in positions of responsibility will think not only of the markets which may be abroad for investment, but also going up and down the streets and selling American products, they can make a decisive contribution to the maintenance of our balance of payments, and also serve the country and the free economy system. So the next few months I think will be very decisive and the burdens of Mr. Herter will be very great. ENTITY, in view of the prospect for a deficit in any event, and a fairly large one if taxes are reduced, is it part of the administration's plan to finance a major part of that deficit outside the banking system in order to reduce the threat of monetary inflation? THE PRESIDENT That will be a judgment which is primarily that of Mr. Martin and the Federal Reserve. He has commented on that to a degree before the Joint Committee this year. He is concerned about the prospect of inflation, because of course it affects us adversely, and also because it affects the balance of payments. I would hope, however, and I am sure that he will agree, that he will any deficit which has to be financed will be financed in a way which will be the maximum degree possible to stimulate the economy without increasing the prospect of another inflationary or speculative spiral. So it is a fine adjustment which Mr. Martin will make, but I am sure that he will be as concerned as all of us are to get the benefit such as it may be out of the deficit, and also at the same time keep and use our monetary tools wisely enough to keep matters in control. His judgment will be, because of the Federal Reserve law, of course final. ENTITY, the strong attitude you took towards Khrushchev during the Cuban crisis has not only been applauded, but has improved the standing of our country throughout the free world. Do not you feel we would gain more respect and further improve our status by really implementing the Hickenlooper amendment on American properties which are seized largely without compensation overseas, rather than just giving lip service? Well, I am not sure I'd accept the premise of the question. The Hickenlooper amendment is very clearly and sharply drawn. We are appointing a distinguished businessmen's committee to advise us on implementing the Hickenlooper amendment. It is not altogether an easy job. We have got one controversy now in Turkey, which involves a default by a previous government which was overthrown, a number of the ministers executed, which was regarded as highly corrupt. The present government is reluctant to accept its obligations. We have the problem in Brazil where you have the seizure of some American property by local governors a local governor and we have looked to the National Government for relief. The Hickenlooper amendment does not go wholly into effect for some months under its terms, but I can inform you that its provisions are being read to the finance minister of every state. ENTITY, this question cropped up in many forms. Here is one form of it: Are current tax plans giving any consideration to increased emphasis on consumption taxes by way of a broad base Federal excise tax in order to relieve some of the tax pressure on income from investment sources? Once again I will pass. I should have chosen one of the other versions ! When I was a Congressman I never realized how important Congress was, but now I do. I think I can paraphrase it by saying are you thinking about the possibility later on, perhaps, of using consumption or sales taxes in the tax packages that you are considering? No, I suppose I I assume what they mean is whether we are thinking of going the route which has been followed in France and some other countries of putting manufacturers' tax, and lessening the burden on income. I think on these details of the tax program that in your interest as well as mine we should wait. ENTITY ENTITY, what progress has been made by our Latin American neighbors to effect tax reforms and economic reforms, so that they begin to carry their own weight under the Alliance for Progress? Well, we have made some progress in some countries. I made a reference the other day at the press conference that some efforts have been made certainly to meet the principles of the Alliance for Progress in Colombia. The President of Chile, who has been visiting us this week, is putting in a new tax program, some of which is causing some concern to American companies which have investments there, but I would say that we have made some progress in some countries. But tax reform is very difficult. It is a very appealing title. But as we know from the struggle which we had in the Congress this year, in our efforts to pass the 7-percent investment credit, and at the same time to collect taxes more effectively through withholding on dividends and interest, a tax which has been on the books for 20 years, tax reform, when we become more specific, does not carry with it the same popular support. They have the same difficulty. I think that the situation in Latin America is very critical. I would say it represents the greatest challenge which the United States now faces, except for the direct matter of our dealings with the Soviet Union. And in some of the countries the situation is far less satisfactory the problems are staggering. And Brazil, which is a matter of great concern to us, is the largest country in Latin America, has a population 40 percent of which is under 20, substantially illiterate in some portions, particularly the northeast, living on an average income of $100 a year, some radicals in control in some areas, so I would say we face extremely serious problems in implementing the principles of the Alliance for Progress. We do it with a good deal less resources than we did with the Marshall plan. And in many ways the Marshall plan was easier. We really only had to rebuild the plants in Europe. The manpower was there, the tradition was there, the resources were there. Latin America does not have the resources. It is dependent on two or three or four commodities for export, the prices of which have been dropping the last 3 years. It does not have the trained manpower or skills. It is trying to accomplish a social revolution under freedom under the greatest obstacles. So I think that we should continue our effort there and not lose heart, but I would say that we face and Latin Americans face-staggering problems in trying to solve it. We had the guest from Honduras whose population is 60 percent illiterate. We go through country after country in Central America, the same high illiteracy, high unemployment, bad health conditions. I would say that we are facing the job of doing this revolution under freedom, and it is probably the most difficult assignment the United States has ever taken on. In addition, because of the atmosphere in some of the countries of Latin America, there has been a flight of capital out of there. The amount of assistance which we put in under the Alliance for Progress amounts to about $550 million a year. We have been losing capital out of Latin America either to Europe or because some of our companies do not feel like reinvesting because of the social conditions-we have been losing capital at a faster rate than that out of Latin America, and with a drop in commodity prices in many ways their balance of payments is worse than it was 2 years ago. This is not the fault of the Alliance for Progress. It is the fault of the very desperate situation which these countries face: 180 million people with a chance that their population will be 600 million by the year 2000, with no particular expectation that their raw materials will dramatically increase. So I think that this deserves the attention and hard work and sympathy of us all, and not walk away because the problems are unsolved. ENTITY, many of the questions submitted dealt with monetary policies, and the central theme seemed to be whether it will be possible and desirable to use a little easy money stimulation as well as tax reduction. And to quote from one of the shorter questions, Why not ease up on money? Well, I think there is a good supply of credit. I think the Federal Reserve Board has attempted to keep credit as free as it could, and the supply of money has been increased with the growth of the economy. I think it would be very difficult to keep it easier than it now is, without having the short term funds pour out at a higher rate than they are. After all, we have seen when Canada put its interest rates up, I think as high as 7 percent, though it has dropped them now, it affected the flow of capital here. In October, we had several cases of major investments using our markets because of our interest rates. The fact of the matter is that I am not sure that we would get much stimulation out of the economy, but I do not see how we could possibly afford easier money than we now have, and still not have a hemorrhage at our balance of payments. I think we have a major problem to balance off the use of monetary policy here at home and affecting our balance of payments abroad, and also that is one of the good arguments, and as a matter of fact I think that we can make the case which I think has almost unanimously been made in Europe, that the United States monetary policy in some ways is too loose, while our fiscal policy is too tight. And it is for that reason that the International Banks in Europe and others have suggested that the reverse would be more appropriate. I think we should attempt to keep monetary policy about where it is, try to liberalize fiscal policy, for the reasons that I have given tonight, but I do not see how we could possibly go any further in the direction of easier credit, while we have a balance of payments which is against us by over two and a half billion dollars a year. ENTITY, there are a number of questions about Cuba. This is a brief one. Is there a firm policy on getting the Russian manpower out of Cuba? THE PRESIDENT Mr. Khrushchev in his agreement only committed himself to the withdrawal of the missiles and the bombers, and the manpower which was connected with the maintenance of those forces. That would amount to several thousand. In addition, he stated that he would, though he did not put a time limit on this, he would be withdrawing other elements. But that guarantee is not as precise and that commitment has not been implemented, nor was it as hard as his others, which he has kept. So this must be a matter of continuing concern, and is the reason why we are maintaining observation and verification by our own means daily, and why we will continue to do so. And while the matter of Cuba, therefore, still remains unsettled, as long as it is a Soviet military base, it of course represents a threat to peace in the Caribbean. On the other hand, it does not represent an offensive threat under present conditions, nor will it be, of course, permitted to do so. ENTITY, we received many questions which reflected some fear that if your tax message were to call for many of the tax reforms discussed from time to time by some of your advisers, the effect might offset the favorable impact of a tax reduction itself. The specific question that we decided to select here was this: Why not have a moratorium on reform until we get back to full employment? Well, the purpose of reform really is directed to the encouraging of growth and employment. I quite agree that to launch into a full scale battle on general reform for academic reasons would be unwise. The central purpose behind the reform must therefore be to encourage those changes in our tax laws which will encourage economic growth for that purpose, and not merely because it might have some longer range interest or significance. The primary job will be to encourage the flow of capital into those areas which stimulate the national growth and not diminish it. But it is going to be a tough fight, because once you spell out, as I said before, reform, it is bound to affect adversely the interests of some, while favoring the interests of others. Therefore reform may be a longer task, and we are anxious that in the effort to get reform, that we do not lose the very important matter of tax reduction for the sake of the economy. I know that I am not satisfying you, and I know this is going to be the major matter before the Congress, this matter of affording a tax cut at a time when we have a deficit. But I do point out that the largest peacetime deficit, which was the '58 deficit of $12.5 billion, came at a time when President Eisenhower believed that he had presented a balanced budget, and the reason of course was the recession of '58. The biggest deficit comes historically and it has been proved, in 1958, 1960 because of a recession. That is what would really knock our budget out of shape. So that as I tried to say in my speech, we are not faced with the question of balancing our budget, or having a tax reduction. I believe we are faced with the fact that we are going to have a deficit mostly because of the sharp rise in the recent years in space and defense, and to increase our taxes sufficient to bring that budget into balance would be defeating, because of course it would provide a heavy deflationary effect on our economy, and move us into a recession at an accelerated rate. So I hope that you gentlemen will realize that we are not talking about irresponsibly increasing the deficit. We have a deficit which is already on the books. What I am concerned about is the kind of deficit we would have if we had a recession, and while the prospects for a recession are not certainly imminent before us, we do have to look at our historical record and realize that any society such as ours, particularly with the tax structure such as ours, must face that prospect at some time. So that we have to decide which kind of a deficit do we want, and for what reason, and which in the longer run offers us the better prospect of bringing our books into balance. In addition, we are hopeful, as the Minuteman begins to come into our defenses, that we will be able to bring our defense expenditures to a level, unless we have a severe international emergency, which in a period of the not-to-distant future will cap off our defense expenditures. The Minuteman will be coming in great quantities. A large portion of our increases in defense in the next budget are due, one, to the pay increase for the military, and they have not had one since 1958, and they are far behind civilian and the other civilian employees of the Government, and for new weapons, of equipping the new divisions which we have built up, the conventional forces, and bringing into our arsenal the Minuteman. And when we have the Minuteman in quantity, Secretary McNamara believes it will be possible to peak off, and not have this steadily rising expenditure in defense. I want to point out that we have increased in conventional forces in the last 2 years the number of our divisions from 11 to 16, and we are also providing equipment for 22 divisions in case it were necessary to mobilize our Guard. We have six divisions in Europe, and we have the equipment for two more. Now, I think the Cuban incident indicated the importance of a strong conventional force. The greatest factor on our side was the fact that we had superior conventional strength on the scene, and it would have been necessary to equalize that strength for the Soviets to initiate the use of nuclear weapons, which of course they were quite reluctant to do. Now, in other areas we do not have a satisfactory conventional position. General Clay is more familiar with this than any man, and this is true in Western Europe. The United States is doing its part, but other countries of NATO have not met their quotas. Up until 2 or 3 years ago, the United States had its six divisions in Western Europe, its two divisions in South Korea, and its three divisions in the airborne Reserve here in the United States, and that is all. Now we have increased by five divisions, and therefore with the obligations that we bear all the way from South Korea through South Viet-Nam to Berlin, as well as our obligations in this hemisphere, I think it was only prudent to increase our conventional as well as our nuclear force. That and our commitment to space have been the big burdens in our budget. Space will continue to rise, but not excessively. Defense we hope to cap off, and that is why I believe that we are not getting in a position where we will be out of control, providing we can maintain a steady rise in our economic growth. ENTITY, why should not the United States emphasize foreign aid by means of technical and material assistance from the United States private firms, backed by United States credit guarantees, rather than the prevalent government-to-government gifts which rarely help American exports? For instance, a large part of the industrial equipment being installed in India and in South America is coming from Europe on long-term credit, rather than from U.S. plants, in spite of our aid to these countries. It is a fact that the United States has given economic assistance, particularly to India, at low rates of interest and with years of grace, while the other members of the consortium have given their assistance on rather short terms and high rates of interest. The fact of the matter is that the United States has carried an excessive burden in foreign assistance, in relation to Western Europe, but not in relation to need. Now, we spend about $1 .7 billion to $1.8 billion in foreign assistance which goes of course to the Pentagon to buy surplus equipment, so therefore it is an addition to our own available funds. Then we have another $2 billion which we give in the form of loans, some of which are reasonably hard, and some of which are soft, but we are emphasizing loans. Now, for that $2 billion, we sustain South Korea, which has 40 percent unemployed; it is been the country which has been the major beneficiary. There is not any doubt that it would go under immediately if the United States ceased its economic assistance. Fifty thousand Americans were killed to protect South Korea. We carry the load, not so much, but still some, on Nationalist China, and we carry a very heavy load in Viet-Nam. Viet-Nam would collapse instantaneously if it were not for United States assistance. We carry a heavy load in Thailand, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and Greece. We also carry some burden in Africa, about $250 million. I had the President of Somalia to visit me 2 weeks ago-the average income for Somalia per capita is $45 a year. When we see how difficult it is to get the Communists out once they get in, when we see the trouble that Cuba has caused, when we see that there is not one Communist regime yet in control in Africa, or indeed in Asia, other than those in North Viet-Nam, North Korea, and China, it seems to me that for this $a billion, that considering that we put $51 or $52 billion into our defense, we are going to put nearly $5 billion into space, $5.5 billion into veterans, 19.5 billion in interest in our debt, $7 billion into agriculture, about $4 billion into public assistance it seems to me that for that $2 billion,. which covers the Alliance for Progress, assistance to India, which has 40 percent of all the underdeveloped people of the world, I think that we should embark with some care on any effort to cut it out. Now, what we are trying to do is cut the dollar loss, which is the real burden; and we are cutting it this year from $1.3 billion, which was the dollar loss in foreign aid, to $800 million. We have increased the support for the Export-Import Bank. We are trying to tie all of our assistance to American purchases, and we hope to have it 80 percent tied, even though it does cost us some more doing it. But if you are going to build a school or a hospital, some local assistance is needed, and most of these countries are bankrupt-Colombia and Brazil and the others. So I would like to cut out foreign aid. It is very unpopular. It is a hard fight each year. President Eisenhower had the same struggle, and so did President Truman. General Clay, as you know, is heading a committee,1 with Mr. Lovett, Eugene Black, Mr. McCollum, and others, to look into this program. But I must say I am reminded of Mr. Robert Frost's motto about not taking down a fence until you know why it is put up, and this is a method by which the United States maintains a position of influence and control around the world, and sustains a good many countries which would definitely collapse or pass into the Communist bloc. Now, India, as I said, has 500 million people. We have been digging our way out of the loss of China for the last 12 years, and my successor in office may have to deal with the problem of a China which is carrying out an expansionary policy with nuclear weapons and missiles. But for India to go, it would seem to me that the whole balance of power in the world would change. So I think that talking about $2 billion what really concerns me is that Western Europe does not do its part on aid, considering the great increase in its own balance of payments position. And I do believe also that the United States should tie as much as possible. But I certainly would be reluctant to see this program abandoned, because really I put it right up at the top of the essential programs in protecting the security of the United States, not for any reasons of long-range good it may do, though it does do that, but if somebody said and I know President Eisenhower feels the same way, because for 2 years he is played an important role in getting that program by if somebody said which programs of the United States Government really contribute to the maintenance of our position around the world, I would have to put this up near the top. But General Clay can make his judgment, and I think whatever judgment he makes can give this program a very important imprimatur. 1 The Committee to Strengthen the Security of the Free World, the establishment of which was announced by the White House on December to, 1962, has the following membership: Gen. Lucius Clay, chairman, Robert A. Lovett, George Meany, Edward S. Mason, Eugene Black, Robert B. Anderson, L. F. McCollum, Herman Phleger, and Clifford Harden. ENTITY, I simply ran out of questions. All I'd like to say to you is congratulations on your answers, and thank you, ENTITY.

{"id": 470, "text": "ENTITY, to most Americans, Iran is still part of the axis of evil, its holding American hostages, and it helps to undermine the middle eastern-middle eastern affairs. Why should Americans stomach, and how can Americans stomach a deal with a country like that? Because we do not want them to get nuclear weapons. It is precisely because Iran has been so antagonistic to us, to friends of ours like Israel, that we have to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. That is been something that has been a top priority of my administration, but also previous Democratic and Republican administrations. That is why we set up 5 years of the toughest sanctions ever imposed on Iran which forced them to negotiate. And that is why we have now put forward a deal in concert with allies like, Great Britain, and Germany, and France and others, that ensures that all the major pathways for them getting nuclear weapons are shut off. And not only are we achieving a central national security goal of ours, but we are doing it without initiating another military action in the middle east at a time when obviously the middle east is in pretty bad shape. That does not mean that we trust Iran, it means that we have set up such a vigorous system to inspect and verify that they are not getting a nuclear weapon, making them shut down facilities that would give us cause for concern, that we and most nuclear experts are able to see into what they are doing and ensure that we are not seeing nuclear proliferation in one of the most volatile parts of the world. You mentioned Israel, our staunchest ally in the middle east, completely, adamantly opposed to this agreement. What are you doing to-to allow that-not to allow our relationship with Israel to deteriorate even further? Well keep in mind that our relationship militarily in terms of intelligence cooperation with Israel has never been stronger. There is a policy disagreement between this administration and everyone else in the world, and prime minister Netanyahu of Israel. And while I respect his legitimate concerns about Iran, as I have said very clearly, he is wrong on this issue. We do not want to have Iran get a nuclear weapon and every credible expert who is looked at this says this is the best path for us not to get a nuclear weapon. What we do have to continue to do though is recognize that even with Iran not having a nuclear weapon, that they are still engaging activities that are adverse to our interests and our values. And we have to work with not just Israel, but other partners in the region to make sure that Iran's not sending shipments to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, to make sure that they are not destabilizing countries that are very important to us. And that is something that we are already doing and will continue to be committed to doing in the years ahead. In the years when you were promoting the Affordable Care Act, you had a lot of allies in Congress who were standing at your side and doing some of the heavy lifting for you. In the case of this Iran deal, it seems as if you are not getting that kind of support from Congress, and you are having to do a lot of it yourself, a little arm twisting here and there we understand. You know, the truth is that this is probably going to be challenging but not as challenging as getting the Affordable Care Act done. I mean we have got terrific Senators, like Tim Kaine in Virginia, who have stood up and made a very clear case as to why this is important to do. And I am very confident that this deal will go forward. It is unfortunate that we had republicans who immediately, uniformly opposed the deal, before the deal was even signed and before they had even read it. But you know one of the things that I have noticed is there was an initial interim deal that we did with Iran during the course of the talks, that the same folks expressed skepticism towards, two years later because it actually shut down any expansion of Iran's nuclear program and worked exactly the way it was designed, suddenly they now all think it was a good deal. So you know the politics of these things today are going to be very different than the politics a year or two years from now when people see that we have been able to shut off Iran's nuclear program from advancing in a way that could pose a threat to us. Thank you very much sir. It was great to talk to you, thank you.

{"id": 405, "text": "ENTITY, on the oil spill, two questions on BP. One is my understanding is that the Oil Pollution Act caps their liability beyond cleanup costs at $75 million, so I am wondering how you will make sure that they do in fact pay other costs -- wages, et cetera. Let me check -- I would need to check with Interior on that, on the $75 million figure. I do not -- I think there are different provisions for different things, but let me take that question and try to find that out. I mean, is it your commitment that BP will pay all costs associated with this spill? That is our commitment, yes. Including like lost wages and that sort of thing? That is specifically one of the things the President spoke with Thad Allen about and with parish presidents and fishermen yesterday, is setting up a system -- and Secretary Napolitano talked about this, this morning -- setting up a system for compensation and claims that is not bogged down. Fishermen particularly are -- we understand what they catch -- they are going to sell what they catch in order to spend money to go back out and do it again. So obviously we have got to set up a system that is -- that provides for that to happen quickly. And just generally, what is your satisfaction level with BP's performance? Well, again, they are responsible; we have oversight. I did this a couple times I think yesterday -- look, there are many different things that we are focused on. First and foremost is capping this well. There were tests over the weekend on the application of sub-sea dispersant, which have thus far performed well and they are continuing to test that -- which is, instead of spraying the dispersant on the surface of the water, it is to release the dispersant near the source of the leak. And that had some positive impact during the first round of testing. The second -- the relief well began -- the drilling began on that last evening, which is a more long-term solution. Obviously BP is working on a structure to possibly put on top of the well and vacuum up the oil to the surface with the water to deal with that. So that certainly -- that is one aspect of what we are dealing with. Secondly, we are dealing with, as the pollutants rise to the surface, containing the spread of that oil on the surface of the water and how that affects both the environment that we are dealing with as well as the local economy. I would say all of those things are what we are overseeing. They are responsible for that. Obviously they have the unique equipment for dealing with this at a depth of 5,000 feet under the floor -- under the surface of the ocean. But we are going to continue to ensure that they are doing all that they need to do from the perspective of state, local and federal authorities. Secretary Napolitano, Secretary Salazar and Lisa Jackson are meeting this afternoon with BP to get an update from them on their ongoing process and to ensure that they are taking the steps that we feel are necessary to respond to an incident of this magnitude. My understanding is it is going to be the BP CEO that is having a meeting today. Yes. Actually the guidance I have has the CEO and the American chair. Can you tell me -- I have two questions, one to follow on BP, which is can you tell me who the President has actually spoken with at BP? And then also if any reaction on Ahmadinejad's comments that he made today? I do not -- I can check. I do not believe the President has spoken with anybody at BP. Obviously, they have -- Secretary Salazar convened a meeting with the CEOs of the oil companies last week. I think we put that list of folks out. Secretary Salazar was in Houston at the BP command center, and these individuals will meet with BP later on -- I think it is at 3:00 p.m. today. Look, I think the speech that you heard today was predictable in that Iran failed to speak about the obligations that it will not live up to. And I think rightly, our delegation and many others left as a series of wild accusations were made during the speech. Do you think it will have any influence on the movement toward actually getting some sanctions against them -- more sanctions? Well, I think the speech today -- I think those that have -- those that are involved in the NPT conference and are living up to the obligations would have wanted to hear the Iranians discuss living up to their obligations. I think them not doing that again shows how further isolated they are from the world community. And we continue to make progress on sanctions at a multilateral level even as we look at ways that we can do so within our own government. Progress, how so? Continue to meet with the U.N. Security Council and continue to make progress moving forward on a Security Council resolution. ENTITY, two questions. The first one is, we hear so many different time frames as to when this oil well will actually be under control. What is the best case and what is the worst-case scenario? I mean, I am hearing anywhere from a matter of days to 90 days in the worst case. What is your sense of how long -- Well, I would direct you to BP in terms of what they might say. Look, I think a series of processes that, as you said, could take a matter of days. I think -- I forget the exact term of the structure putting on top of the valve would take probably another week. The original well took 90 days to drill and it could take that long to drill a relief well. So if it takes up to 90 days, is that the something that the President is comfortable with? Well, I am not sure the President can alter the pace of drilling in the Atlantic. But that is what we are looking at. Look, we are -- I mean, in the Gulf, I am sorry. We are -- I used this phrase yesterday, as Secretary Salazar used this phrase, and that is we are going to do what we have to do. We will keep our, as Secretary Salazar said, our boot on the throat of BP to ensure that they are doing all that they -- all that is necessary, while we do all that is humanly possible to deal with this incident. Absolutely. I wonder, on the plane ride back yesterday, did the President share any personal reflections with you about what he saw on the ground, how he is feeling about all this? Well, I think the -- I talked a little bit about this on the trip home. You get a real sense of the topography, the geography of what we are dealing with, and how -- the President said that you could see from the air the -- the wetlands in that area, obviously, have undergone lots of change and not for the good over the past many years. The President said you could see that from the air. Speaking with the parish presidents, speaking with the local fishermen, you get a sense of what is at stake, both environmentally and economically. And I think the President reiterated to all of us, as he has said over many, many days, and that is we must do all that we can, as aggressively as we can, to combat this incident. ENTITY, I just want to follow up on that. When you say, keep your boot on the throat of BP, obviously sounds tough, but how do you actually follow up on it when, as was pointed out, the liability cap seems to be $75 million? Well, I will check on that before we -- Well, because Senator Menendez has a bill he just introduced today with other senators, saying he wants to expand it from $75 million to I think $10 billion. You said earlier, we want to set up a system to make sure BP pays more than just the cleanup; pays for lost wages, et cetera. What kind of system can you set up retroactively if the law is the law? No, no, no, the law provides for -- BP is the responsible party, right? So if local fishermen cannot fish, that is an economic loss that BP is going to have to pay. I am talking about setting up the actual system for the filing of those claims with BP and others in order to get them reimbursed as quickly as possible. That is not a retroactive thing, though. But if they are just responsible for cleanup and containment, can you really force them to pay the lost wages? Absolutely. That is part of the law. Absolutely. The economic damages that are incurred are part of the cost of this incident. Absolutely. And two other quick things. The Prime Minister Netanyahu call -- there have been reports that President Abbas may be coming to the White House in mid-May to try to get Mideast peace talks. Where are you on whether he is coming? Are you inviting him? I have no announcements on that. And then on the Supreme Court, where is the President in his decision-making process? We know he did some interviews, face-to-face interviews with potential nominees last week. Do you anticipate more face-to-face meetings this week? Is he close to a decision? Where are you? Close. Close as in? I could not agree more with your characterization. Close. So how close? Is he -- will he announce it this week? You know, I was thinking about this as I was getting a series of emails, will it be today, will it be tomorrow. I am happy to advise you of when the event is when we do announce it. I think it would be -- might be duplicative to announce each day when the event is not going to be. Well, but last week you did. You ruled out last week. Yes, I did rule out last week. Can you rule out this week? No. Okay, there you go. See, I just had a whole week's worth of duplicative email -- -- that is awesome. He has a lot of free time -- not free time, but I mean not public time on his schedule today. Chip, where you got the impression that the President has a ton of free time, I -- I am sure he is -- What are you guys watching at CBS that I am not afforded to watch at -- I mean, there is not a lot on his public schedule. I see. Okay. I am going to forward that along to him. Is he doing -- is he using that time to do some interviews with Supreme Court nominees today? I am not going to get into the interview process that the President has. I will -- safe to say, Chip, there is a lot on the President's plate and a lot that he is doing out of the watchful eye of the public. And today does that include Supreme Court? I anticipate that he is working on the process of the Supreme Court, without getting into the specifics of what those actions might be. What is his involvement, how actively involved is he in either getting information or whatever else on the Times Square situation? Yesterday, in traveling to the Gulf, John Brennan was with us, briefed the President on the helicopter ride from here to Andrews on Times Square. We spent about 50 minutes in the conference room of Air Force One on the ride down on the Gulf -- the situation in the Gulf. John got information throughout the day and passed that along to the President and has done so again today. And is there anything new on claims from groups overseas that they were responsible for this? Does the White House have any reaction to that? We are actively participating in the investigation, making sure that local authorities have all the resources necessary to determine who is responsible. We have not made that determination yet, but that is actively ongoing. On the boot on the throat thing, Ed said it sounds tough. Well, it actually sounds hostile. Is that an accurate reflection of the relationship between the federal government and BP right now? Is it a hostile relationship? Do you really need to keep your boot on their throat in order to get them to act? I think that is -- I think the expression largely conveys that while the responsible party is BP, we will do, as the oversight authority in managing the cleanup, the spread -- we are going to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything that it can and should do. The President heard yesterday from local officials that were concerned about the plans for -- the plans that BP had when the oil got closer to different parishes for extra booming and for different activities that could be undertaken. The President understands that frustration and worked -- Admiral Allen met with the parish presidents in order to get -- move the process with BP forward more quickly. That is the process that has been ongoing throughout this and will continue. Do you think the President feels like he needs to keep his boot on their throat? Is that the way he is reacting? I think the President accurately conveyed in his remarks yesterday that we are going to do everything humanly possible, and ensure that BP is doing everything humanly possible, to deal with this as comprehensively and as quickly as they can. Does the administration feel that BP has done a good job with this cleanup? Okay, so you are not ready to give an endorsement or -- Well, we still have an active incident. I think the President will be pleased when there is no more oil leaking from the floor of the ocean. The President will be pleased when we have taken sufficient measure to ensure that its spread is not vast. But I will say this -- I do not -- this is a process that is going to, as the President said yesterday, is going to take some time. To the extent there are any deficiencies in the cleanup process, does the federal government have some responsibility for that? You guys have taken pains to emphasize that you have been involved in day one directing and overseeing BP's response -- Well, again, that is the -- the law mandates, based on the incidents that happened in Alaska in the late '80s, to ensure that companies that cause these type of accidents do not hand the taxpayers of this country a bill and walk away. -- but in terms of what they decide to do or how they try to mitigate it? Well, again, we are -- that is why I used Secretary Salazar's colorful phraseology to talk about the role that we are playing and the role that Thad Allen as the National Incident Commander, and others are playing in order to ensure that BP does everything it can. So if Gulf Coast residents find the response in any way lacking, would it be fair for them to hold the federal government responsible as well as BP? The President is doing everything we can to respond. As you mentioned, we have been there since the very beginning in responding to the reports of -- the accurate reports of an explosion, with the Coast Guard assisting in the recovery efforts. That began our effort in this and it will not stop for quite some time. Can you say that the taxpayer, the American taxpayer will not face any cleanup costs? The commitment the President made yesterday is the responsible party will pay for this and that responsible party is BP. And regardless of caps or anything, somehow, something -- I will look into the notion of caps. I will look into that. And I know that the review is ongoing, but is there any way you can point to where -- what you are looking at? Is this a regulatory issue for the federal government, where regulators fell down on the job? Is it a technological issue? Where is this review headed? Jonathan, I think that the President's charge to Secretary Salazar over the course of the next 30 days is to examine every aspect of what may have gone wrong and contributed to, or caused the incident that we have -- that we are dealing with in the Gulf today. And his charge is wide open and I believe that what he finds will determine our next steps as it relates to offshore oil policy. When you say the company is responsible and the government has oversight, does that mean that the government is ultimately in charge of the cleanup? No, the responsible party is BP. But who is in charge of the cleanup operation? Who is calling the shots? The National Incident Commander is overseeing to ensure that BP does what is necessary. And then will the government ultimately hand BP a tab for every dime that, say, the Coast Guard, the EPA, and every other agency -- Yes. So there is like a running account of this? They will -- we discussed this in a number of meetings here last week, that specific actions -- these are the actions that we are going to take and these are -- this is who will pay for it, yes. And again that is -- and that is dictated by the law. That is dictated by the law. From the Valdez -- From the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Can you elaborate on what kind of a claims process you want to establish? Well, I can -- let me put you in touch with the Joint Information Center down there for a more technical analysis. But the President wants something that is not duplicative, that is not overly bureaucratic, one that -- obviously, you have got folks that are losing money because they are unable to do what they do for a living. Those are people that cannot be out of -- if that is how you make your living, losing that money is a very big deal. We want to make sure that that money is made up as quickly as possible. Thanks. ENTITY, does the President have any plans or does he want to meet with the CEO or president of BP? Or is it just a matter of they have not gotten the schedule together yet or -- Again, I think the -- I think those that are meeting with him -- with the CEO and the president today are -- and again, Secretary Salazar has been in touch with folks at BP throughout this. On the dinner tonight, the Executive Committee dinner, will the President be sounding out any members of the Executive Committee on a new program or new policies in advance of his speech tomorrow? Well, look, I think the President -- there is obviously a lot on the Senate's docket right now in terms of financial reform. I think the President will reiterate his support for, and ask business for their support for, financial regulations, discuss the efforts that the administration is currently undertaking to rebuild the economy and to put in place an environment for continued hiring. We are hopeful and optimistic that by the end of the week, we will have another positive month of job growth. Will there be a readout? I will check. I do not know what we are going to do on that yet. One last thing. You mentioned financial reform. There is a package of amendments being proposed for the financial reform pending in the Senate. One of them is calling for a tax on excessive bonuses on firms that got individual assistance from the government. Does the President support that? I have -- I'd have to have those guys take a look at the amendment. Has BP been truthful with the administration? Can you -- In all of its -- either representing what its doing, what it is capable of doing, in its understanding of how much oil was leaking? At any point in the communication with BP, does the administration believe it is gotten willfully errant information? I would have to ask somebody at the Department of the Interior or Homeland Security if they felt otherwise. Major, our focus has been throughout this process to plan for the very worst and to ensure that our response flowed from what could be the very worst. So that is what has governed our actions since the night of the explosion when the Coast Guard came to the assistance of those that had been hurt and those that were missing. The reason I ask, the boot on the throat metaphor indicates or suggests at least to those who might hear it for the first time that something went awry or has gone awry with the relationship, and the administration or the federal government needs to be much more forceful to force an intractable partner to do something they otherwise would not do. I mean, it suggests that the cooperation has broken down. Maybe I am just from a different part of the country. Would hold your feet to the fire, would that be something more that would be understandable to -- I am just asking why that metaphor -- I am glad I did not wear my boots today, right? I do not know, holding your feet to the fire could create some pain, Chip -- again, I -- maybe you guys do not go camping either. The law creates this sort of partnership that is being worked out for the first time in real time where the industry -- Well, I do not think this is the -- I do not think this is the first time that -- Of this magnitude. Okay, so not the first time, but the first time -- right -- of this magnitude. Look, again, I cannot phrase it any differently than the President has over the past many days, which is it is our obligation to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything within their power to cap the well; to respond to the pollution that has -- that is on top of the water; to ensure that we are doing all that is necessary to ensure that we mitigate its spread, and where it does spread and interrupt economic activities for local communities, that that is being dealt with. I think those are all -- that is the full range of things that we are supervising. For those who wonder and ask the question, what was the time lapse for the designation of an incident of national significance? Can you walk us through that? Yes, I -- Because when I talked to Thad Allen on Friday, he said you really have to look at this as two calendar events -- the explosion, the search and rescue, putting out the fire; then a catastrophic leak. He said you really need to measure these as sort of two separate instances of intervention at the federal level and with BP. Do you view the calendar that way, and that day one is when the leak became the top priority after dealing with the explosion and the search and rescue and everything else? Well, first and foremost -- again, first and foremost, the Coast Guard arrived on the scene I think with four vessels over the course of some period of time after the explosion -- I think that happened at roughly 10:30 p.m. that night -- to assist in the fire that was ongoing and to ensure that all that could be was being done to get folks that were injured off, and to look for those that were missing. I think pretty quickly after that, though, it is pretty clear that there is, for whatever reason, oil in the water. The response -- I think there were -- I'd have to go back and look at my notes -- I think there were some 70 vessels in the water, there were scores of planes in the air, dealing with this even at that point of designating it a spill of national significance. This is a response that has been ongoing since the report of that explosion some many days ago. How would you characterize what happened in Times Square? Was that an act of terrorism? I think anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, I would say that that was intended to terrorize, absolutely. And I would say that whoever did that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes. We do not know who is responsible and that is what we are looking at now. In the speech at the U.N. today, does it in any way lead the administration to say, okay, the door is now closed? I mean, you are not going to come to your -- to live up to your obligations is the formulation from this podium and elsewhere -- does it do anything to narrow the ability of this administration to wonder aloud if Iran is going to do anything different? I think the likely -- I would say this. The offer is still there. The likelihood that they will take that offer and walk through the door seems -- they seem, and I think through their words and their actions, unwilling to live up to their obligations. That is why we have got a dual-track approach going to ensure that if they fail to live up to those obligations, that we take those next steps. Last question. Does the President have any reaction to immigration -- No, no, no -- -- the immigration protests all over the country this weekend? Look, I think the President for quite some time, dating back to his membership in the Senate, is somebody who is pushed for comprehensive immigration reform. I think regardless of what side of the political argument you are on, I do not think there is any doubt that what has happened in Arizona leads you to understand that this town has to act on something that is comprehensive, lest we have an immigration policy through -- by 50 states. The timing will depend, I think, quite frankly, Major, on willingness from individuals in both parties to step up and meet those obligations. How intensively is the President monitoring the Greek debt crisis, and what does he think the long delay in the Europeans getting together to actually do something about this says about their cohesion? Let me point you to Treasury for the response to the latter. The President has gotten updates throughout this process on a number of occasions. Time has been taken in the President's economic briefings that happen most days to go through -- that go through what is at stake. Does he worry that it will have an effect on U.S. recovery? Well, we have certainly talked about the notion that -- look, we are happy with the steps that Greece says they are going to take and happy with the response. Obviously anything -- we are greatly concerned about anything throughout the world that could cause a disruption in the continuing recovery of the global economy. That is something that the NEC, the CEA, and the Treasury have looked at throughout this process. Only two questions, ENTITY. It is early in the week, Lester, but I am ready. Thank you very much. In view of President Franklin Roosevelt's 998 press conferences, why has President Obama held not a single White House press conference since last July? Lester, what would you -- let me ask you this. Can I ask you just -- I just have one question. You can ask me as many as you wish. Excellent. I am just going to use one. When the President took eight questions from members of the White House press corps at the Nuclear Security Summit at the Washington Convention Center, what would you call that? That was not a press conference. What would you call it? It was a select few. A select few what? A select few reporters. It was not a White House press conference. That was my question. Well, can I ask another question? I do want to -- I am going to -- Of course you can. I am going to -- can I take Chip's thing and just ask one more? What differently do you think the President would have done at the Nuclear Security Summit in taking the eight questions from members of the White House press corps that might have denoted -- might have tripped your definition of a press conference? It would be a wonderful thing if he had allowed all reporters -- just it would be wonderful if you would allow these front-rowers two questions and then go all the way back to the back and then come back and let them start again. That would be fair. Thank you very much. Lester, you are a happy occupant of the front row today and I hope that you will -- No, it is not the front row, it is the second row. Front rows today -- pardon me. I hope that you will take the opportunity to speak with each one of these members individually. Now, I did not -- I do not -- I hope you did not dodge my second question. No, I try not to dodge. Okay, I just -- I am trying to figure out -- the President answered eight questions from the White House press corps. Unclear -- I will admit -- But only eight of them -- only eight selected. Okay, so how many unselected would it have checked your box as to being a White House press conference? I think that if he wanted a press conference, he would have invited all of us, not just a select few, which he does so often. Lester, I do not -- were you at the event? Did you apply for credentials to come to the event? I would be delighted if I thought there was any chance. No, no, but I asked you, did you apply for credentials to come to the event? No, I did not. So you were offered the opportunity but declined to do so? I do not know if you saw the hall that we were in -- it is a whole lot bigger than where we are. It is a whole lot bigger than the East Room. -- you only had eight. There were a whole lot of people there. Again, I just -- can you give me a number? Is it a number thing that would -- you think if we would have -- if it was not eight, it maybe was like nine? Well, there is 47 that are here today. So 47 -- Sitting, and eight more standing. Right, so 47 and 8 is 55. So the President would have taken -- if the President took 55 questions, would that have -- John Kennedy took 20 -- no, 38 questions in his first press conference. You remember that, do not you? So it is not 55 -- it is not eight, it is not 55, it is 38? Can I go to my second question? No, I am just trying to get an answer to my second question. I suddenly have found this to be wildly amusing. You are an enormously amusing man. And inexplicably, I am finding this to be equally amusing. I am just trying to -- just help me out, Lester, because we have now established that 55 is probably a lot, right? Thirty-eight you said Kennedy took -- so that could be an early entrant for the number of questions in which it is possible for the event to be designated a press conference. Eight appears on your measure to be too small. Are you comfortable with somewhere between eight and 38? Or do you want to -- is there a more specific number that you want to -- I understand that 90 -- that 90 reporters usually come to those -- So we got a 90. That is -- apparently 55 seems to be quite in the middle. And then there is 60, the number we need to end this filibuster. If he could give shorter answers and only recognize them for two -- Let us move on. Let us move on. -- he'd get through a lot. But I want to ask my second question, if I may. Okay, will the transcript please -- just you can just put this in parentheses -- -- more questions -- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Goyal. I am -- this is my press conference. Can you just put in parentheses that it appeared as Lester did not answer my second question, but we had like 90, 55, 38 and eight to the -- now, I will -- just for a point of personal privilege, it is unclear as if Lester's definition of the President ever having participated in a White House news conference would have been the case because I do not believe that -- I do not believe the President has ever taken 38 questions at one event. It is the last one. What is the President's reaction to how Mexico treats illegal aliens from Central America as detailed by syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin? I am not aware that the President -- I mean they are very tough in enforcing that border. I will take a look at that. On the Times Square incident, is this like the incident on Christmas Day in that it was a missed -- it was a near-miss? Remember how angry the President was on screening for the flight that came into Chicago on Christmas Day? Does this -- Detroit -- -- does this incident represent in Times Square on Saturday night represent an incident where they just lucked out and a terrorist incident did not happen? I think the President and the mayor have both mentioned that as you have heard for many years, if people see suspicious activity to quickly alert the authorities. The President -- Bill handed me a note that the President spoke with Duane Jackson to commend and thank him for his vigilance in alerting authorities -- and for those authorities acting quickly to prevent anything from becoming -- anything from happening as a result of what was placed in that car. The police have apparently now questioned the original owner of this car. And it appears that it was sold without any paperwork in Connecticut I think last month. Does that kind of information reach the President? Yes. Yes. Anything more you can tell us about the -- No. That was some of the updates that John provides the President. ENTITY, you all have pointed to the meeting the President had in the Oval Office on the day that the rig sank, and there were a lot of people there -- Napolitano, Salazar, the FEMA boss, Admiral Allen. How unusual is that kind of meeting? Can you give us some context of how high on the radar screen that something gets when you have that many folks? Well, look, obviously that was -- obviously, leaving aside sort of where we have gone from the 22nd, obviously a rig of that size, an explosion, 11 people dead, that sinking into the Gulf is something of great importance. And the best way -- I think the President would believe, and I think many people would believe -- the best way to get the most up-to-date information as to what everybody is doing in real time is to do something like that. Look, the President's involvement though -- later today, the President is going to speak with the governors of Tennessee and California about the flooding -- I am sorry -- Tennessee and Kentucky -- about the flooding that is going on there. And I think our FEMA Director is headed to that region later today. So whether it is a large meeting or it could be just a discussion with each of the governors to get what is going on on the ground, I think that provides the President and the team with a lot of information. Yesterday was a good -- when we got to the command center in Venice, you had representatives from -- you had the governor, the lieutenant governor, the parish president, the Coast Guard, the EPA, all giving input into what was going on, what they wanted to see happen differently, along with senior staff members from here at the White House that can work out any kinks in the command chain. ENTITY, there are reports today that the chairman of the FCC is leaning towards abandoning his push for rules that would ensure what some call net neutrality, something that would obviously be a big blow to public interest groups, as well as many supporters of the President. What is the White House reaction? Let me get an update on where that is without going off of what may or may not happen. Why was New Jersey canceled? I do not think that is what George meant. But we discussed travel for the next few days; on Friday, thought that moving -- obviously, when he goes there is a lot of assets that need to be moved. Those assets were moved in order to support our trip to the Gulf. And we look forward to going back, but it will not be on Wednesday. Sheila Bair has been urging lawmakers to scrap this plan for a derivative regulation, saying it will destabilize banks and also drive risks to other parts of the financial sector. What is the White House reaction? I saw the article. I have not talked with folks in the administration. Obviously, what was contained in the President's original -- in the original plan was to ensure that derivatives were -- these were activities that were moved out of the dark and onto regulated exchanges. We continue to believe that that is a strong route to go to ensure that what is happening is regulated. I have not spoken specifically as to what Sheila Bair had to say. Can you describe the chain of command on a minute-to-minute or a day-to-day basis in terms of the cleanup and trying to staunch the flow of the oil leak? In other words, does Admiral Allen tell BP, okay, you have got X number of submersibles; we want them down there doing this, that, or the other thing? As BP endeavors to create this cofferdam, is the United States giving advice on the design of the cofferdam, resources or facilities to build the cofferdam? Let me -- on the cofferdam, let me get some information from the Joint Information Center. Look, obviously, this is a response that touches on a lot of different departments, right? The Department of Interior -- Minerals Management has purview over drilling; DHS over incidents; when pollutants hit the land it becomes EPA. Obviously, Thad Allen, as a result of the declaration, is the National Incident Commander and -- Right, but I am talking about the federal government. All those entities together, regardless of their distinctions and what their jurisdictions are, who is calling the shots in terms of the deployment of the resources and the technology of -- the government does not have submersibles, BP has the submersible. So does any one -- or any one of those agencies dictate when that submersible goes down, what it does down there? Those submersibles by BP have been in the water, the robotics -- look, they are doing what they can do safely at the site in order to try to fix the valves, to get as accurate a picture as they can of what is happening underwater. You see -- and I think some pretty specific diagrams and explanations of where these breaches are, which is governing the engineering of the instrumentation to put on top of that leak. But, again, we have got -- today we have got Interior, Homeland Security, and EPA -- Thad Allen is not at that meeting, had to -- was doing something else at that time -- but all these people are ensuring that BP is doing what they need to do. ENTITY, what kind of discussions have there been between this administration and the British government in terms of the spill? Any at all? I can check on that. I do not know off the top of my head. I want to follow up on that and also on Israel. On the British government, if BP defaults or goes bankrupt, does the British government have any obligation to help pay this huge, multibillion debt? That is a legal question that I do not know the answer to. Could you look into that? Yes, I will certainly look into it. And on Israel, did you get into specific topics -- settlements, Jerusalem, and so forth? Nothing more than the readout that I have here. Last Friday, Senator Bill Nelson said that a energy legislation that included a component of offshore drilling would be dead on arrival. Lindsey Graham today says, we have had problems with car design, but you do not stop driving, as a way to suggest that you continue the offshore drilling. Has the administration's viewpoint of this evolved since last week when you said it would affect possibly the plans, but you were not ready to talk about it? Sam, the President was specific in ordering Secretary Salazar to look at all the possible aspects of what could or did go wrong in this instance, to report back to him in that 30-day period -- after that 30-day period of time, and that this is an administration that is going to take whatever information we get from that and have that dictate our decision-making going forward. I think it would be premature to get too far ahead of where Secretary Salazar's investigation is, even as our priority, Sam, is to plug the leak in the floor of the ocean, deal with the spread of the oil on the surface, to ensure that we are doing all that is possible to prevent environmental and economic damage. So you have not gotten enough information to fully rule out further offshore drilling and amend your legislation? The investigation, Sam, is to determine what happened and to use that information going forward to dictate any changes in our policy -- understanding this, Sam, that -- I forget the number of active wells that are currently in the Gulf. I mean, the Gulf is -- this area of the Gulf was, if I am not mistaken, largely unaffected by the President's announcement on the Outer Continental Shelf. So I do not know if what you -- if your question was to ask how this affects the President's announcement, or how does this affect any drilling that is done in the Outer Continental Shelf. I want to know how it affects the administration's proposal for offshore drilling -- And I would point you to what Secretary Salazar will ultimately report to the President.

{"id": 512, "text": "ENTITY, how are you? I am good thank you, ENTITY. It is been a while! It has, since you became my Champion on the Apprentice. Well that was 10 years ago. Can you believe it? It is a long time but I appreciate all the nice things you have said, and every once in a while a hit, but that is OK. I always say that you do not mind criticism if it is not hysterical. That is true. You do not mind listening to criticism, do you? That is true. No I do not , if it is real. If it is fake, I do not like it. I mean when they give you false stories, and there is so much of it in the media, but you have always been very fair. And you really are a talented guy. Look, you were on the Apprentice, and I would not say you were the most popular person in the sense of the other people liking you, but you were the smartest person and that had something to do with your victory. I actually found the quote that you said to me. This is exactly at the moment you made me your Apprentice. Go ahead. I do not know if you can remember what you said, but you said this. You said 'ENTITY, you are a vicious guy. I have seen it. You can try and dispute it. You are tough, you are smart, you are probably brilliant You are certainly not diplomatic, but you did an amazing job, and you beat the hell out of everybody, and you won by far more than anybody'. That is true. Watching your campaign, it looked like you'd stolen my playbook ENTITY. Well, it is been an interesting campaign, and you know, often times they say that Hillary was a terrible candidate. They never said I was a great candidate, but we won. It was a convincing win. It was an electoral college I guess it was like 223 to 306. You remember that it could never be 270. I'd love to do popular vote, it would be such a thing. I would love to do a popular vote, but it is a much different kind of a contest. I think it would be actually an easier way of doing it, but the electoral college is nice because it gets you into so many different states that you would not see otherwise. But we had a great campaign and we won, and the country is doing fantastically well. Some people think you did not actually want to win. Well, that is such a false story. That is fake news, that was in that fake book. But that is such a false story. I mean first of all, you know me, and I actually though I was going to win because I'd go to stadiums and we'd have 25,000, 30,000 people in the stadiums. We would have a fever pitch, it was incredible what was happening that last two months of the campaign. And coming into the last month I thought we were going to win. We were getting massive crowds. My opponent was not getting good crowds at all. She was getting, you know, singers and entertainers to fill up the stadiums. They'd finish singing and then everybody would leave and she was left there. So I am telling you, I really thought I was going to win, and I very much wanted to win. If I did not win I would have been very disappointed. You have had an extraordinary year. Whether people love you or loathe you, it is been extraordinarily eventful. Depending on who you talk to, you are either delivering on a lot of your promises, beginning to make America great as you vowed, or, and you know the other half of this, you are a raging tweeting wrecking ball who is destroying the country and terrifying the entire planet. How do you plead? I plead not guilty. To all of it? Or the second bit? I think I shakes things up. It had to be shaken up. The country had to be shaken up. We are doing incredibly on an economic basis. Financial stock market just hit another new high. We have had 84 since the election 84 new market highs. Think of that. It is incredible. It is never happened before. It is a record. That in itself is a record. During the course of a little more than a year we have had think of it 84 stock market records. It is going to go higher. Regulation nobody's done anywhere near like I have done. That is also a record, a world record for ENTITYs. But what happened is, we passed a tax bill not easy to get. Many people have tried to do it, they were not able to do it, and this is the biggest one we have ever passed, bigger than the Reagan bill. And it is had a bigger impact than anybody even thought. But I would also say that the tax cuts, added to the regulation cuts, is what made the difference. And people How significant was the Apple move? Well, I thought it was great, but that was one move. They are going to invest $350 billion, they are going to build plants all over the place, they are going to build a college, they are going to build this incredible campus. They are fantastic. So it is a $350 billion investment, which I guess is probably the largest or certainly right up there largest ever made by a company. So we are doing very well, people are coming back into the country in droves. One thing very exciting to me is Chrysler they are leaving Mexico and they are going back to Michigan. You have not heard that in a long time. We are doing things that nobody thought possible and the country is becoming very very strong again economically. Unemployment is at record lows. Women unemployment 17 years. Think of it, 17 years. Black unemployment the best record in history, the history of our country. African American unemployment, best. Hispanic unemployment, best in the history of the country. All of the things that I said on the campaign trail coming true, so I am very happy about it. A lot of people will listen to that a lot of people do not want to give you any credit but a lot of that is indisputable. The economy is in good shape. The global economy is in good shape. And that is been taking a lot of the global economy Piers is because of how well we are doing. Most people will not admit that, but we are doing well, that is helping all around the globe. That is a very good thing. Your supporters get frustrated that a lot of the tweeting the tweetstorms, the controversies, some of the more outlandish things that you occasionally say that they distract from that kind positive message. Do you accept that? Do you care? I do not think it is so many of my supporters. I think a lot of other people, they use that I do not call it tweeting, I call it social media. And you are a big social media man by the way. you do great with it. And I think you might agree with that statement. I like your tweets. I like the kind of unfettered access to ENTITY's mind in real time. If I was not able to do that I call it a modern day form of communication, OK if I was not able to do that, because I get a lot of fake news, I get a lot of news that is very false, very made up. You saw all of the stories that were wrong this year. I mean one of the stories was so wrong it drove the stock market down substantially and it was wrong. They have made a lot of mistakes and lot of them were made on purpose. If I do not have that form of communication, I cannot defend myself. Unless I am going to have a news conference every 15 minutes Do you actually tweet yourself? I do. I do. I also give it to people and sometimes I will have I had one case where a lawyer did a tweet, you know they'd call it. I have a man, Dan Scavino, and I have people that are with me, you know Hope and you know Sarah The whole world waits for you to wake up, on tenterhooks. It is a crazy situation. Are you actually lying in bed with your phone working out how to wind everybody up? Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever. But generally speaking during the early morning or during the evening, I can do that, but I am very busy during the day very long hours, I am busy and sometimes I will just dictate out something really quickly and they will give it to one of my people to put it up. There is been a few big events in the last week, one of which was the big Women's March on the first anniversary of your inauguration. The #MeToo and the Time's Up campaigns have really resonated with millions of women. And they partly hold you to blame for a lot of attitude towards women. Do you have a message for them? Because we are a year on from the last time there were all these marches, a lot is happening in that area of sexual harassment and you have seen what is happened in Hollywood and so on. What message could you give these women who are marching that you are for them and not the problem? Well, I am for them and I think a lot of them understand that. You know, I won many categories of women and the women vote in the election, and people were shocked to see it. I was running against a woman and I am winning all of these categories. You know that better than anybody. And I think I would do even better right now In fact we have just had polls coming out just a little while ago, just before I walked into the room that are really up tremendously. I think that is maybe because of the economy, but I just said before that women have the best unemployment numbers that they have had in 17 years. And they are doing tremendously in business, they are doing tremendously in so many ways, and people are starting to see that. Now, you are always going to have marches, and I guess the march was a lot smaller than it was last year But do you agree with their basic principles, which are gender equality and safety. When it comes to safety, women want to feel safe, particularly in the work place. Do you sign up to that? I do, but I also think they want to feel safe at the border. I think they do not want people pouring into their country. I think they want to see our military get much stronger. I mean women, you know, families, they want to see strength at the border. They want to see a strong law enforcement. I am a very much law and order person and candidate when I ran. The uniformed services, the military there is nobody better than me on the military. I have increased the budget, we are going to have a budget, $700 billion this year. The Democrats were not going to have anywhere near that. I think women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home in many different respects A lot of the women I spoke to about this, they said it would be great to hear ENTITY, given some of the more disrespectful things that have been out there, and the way you have spoken about women, would you acknowledge that you had said things that perhaps you would not say now? That you have also listened as many men are listening right now that you have changed, you have changed as a man? Well I think we have to evolve. If we do not evolve, there is something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women, and I think you know that very well because you know me, and you have spent a long period of time with me. You see all of the women I have working around me and working with me. Tremendous respect for women. You have a lot of strong women around you. Melania, and your team here, the press team. Do you identify as a feminist? Are you a feminist? No, I would not say I am a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I am for women, I am for men, I am for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it and they have to win And women are doing great. And I am happy about that. Move to Britain. A lot of stuff has been going on between you and my country, which has been I think it is good. I think I am very popular in your country. Let us not be too hasty ENTITY. But I believe that, I really do. I get so much fan mail from people in your country. They love my sense of security. They love what I am saying about many different things. I have a great I own the great Turnberry and other things in your country Turnberry in Scotland and I am getting tremendous I mean we get tremendous support from people in the UK. But there are a lot of politicians, mainly the opposition politicians Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Leader, Sadiq Khan, London Mayor I do not know the man, I do not know the man. They want you banned. They do not want you to come on any kind of visit, a normal visit, state visit, anything. Well, that is their problem. I mean, if they do not , I could very nicely stay home. But I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister, who I just left. And I think she is been doing a very good job. We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we do not . I support her. I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. I mean, we will come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen. But I am a tremendous supporter of the UK. Tremendous supporter. There is nobody that believes more strongly. You are half-British right? Well, my mother was born in Scotland, in the Hebrides. That makes you half-British. My mother was born in Stornoway. You know what they call that? Serious Scotland, right? That is serious Scotland. She was born in Stornoway. Do you feel half-British? I sort of do. I love the country. I am in Aberdeen with a tremendous I also have a great situation over in Ireland in Doonbeg over there. And of course Turnberry that is the Mona Lisa, one of the great Mona Lisas of the world in terms of sport and golf, and I own Turnberry. And I love the UK. I have a special maybe because it is my mother, who I thought was one of the great people I have ever known What would she have made of what is happened to you, your mother? She would have you know she had a great sense of regal. She had a great sense of She had a love for the Queen. She had a love for the Royal Family. She really respected the Queen. And she loved the pomp and ceremony and circumstance but she loved the ceremony. The fact is, she loved the UK She would have loved you to get a state visit, right? Well, she would go back every year to Scotland. She just thought it was incredible. You know, she came over here when she was 19, she came over to the United States when she was 19. She met my father very it was not a long time. They got married, they were married many many decades and they had a great marriage. You know, she was a terrific woman, and maybe that is and again she loved Scotland and maybe that is one of the reasons that I feel the same way Do you feel sad that neither of your parents ever got to see their son become ENTITY of the United States? Well, I do, but they are seen me have great success, because I have had great success. And you know, I have been successful even if you talk about, I do a show on television. They always turn out very rarely does a show become a big hit like I had. I go into that, the real estate I have had a lot of hits. So they got to see a lot, but there is nothing like what happened here. I mean, the presidency is something special, but more importantly, I am so happy with the results, because if you look at what is going on, and you look at our country, and you look at the way it is thriving. We are having a stock market like just about they have never had before. Ever before. We have picked up Piers, we have picked up $8 trillion in value during the course of 12 months I just want to pick you up on one thing about the reaction in Britain. Because a lot of people do not like you in Britain, fuelled by these politicians, fuelled by some of the more inflammatory things you have said. The one particular thing, because I want to try and just clarify with you you retweeted an organisation called Britain First, one of the leaders, three times. And this caused Well, three times boom boom boom. This caused huge anxiety and anger in my country, because Britain First is basically bunch of racists, fascists Of course, I did not know that. Well, that is what I wanted to clarify with you. What did you know about them when you did those tweets? Well, I know nothing about them, and I know nothing about them today other than I read a little bit, and I guess and again, I am in the United States, so I do not read as much about it. Perhaps it was a bit story in Britain, perhaps it was a big story in the UK, but in the United States it was not a big story. I did a retweet. You know, a retweet sometimes you do When you do your own tweeting or you do your own social media, it is fine. When you do those retweets, they can cause problems, because you never know who is doing it to start off with. The way it was interpreted you did not take those down retweets for several weeks the way it was interpreted was, you were effectively endorsing this bunch of racists, and that caused a lot of anger. Well, I do not know who they are. I know nothing about them, so I would not be doing that. And I am as I say often, I am the least racist person that anybody's going to meet. And certainly I was not endorsing anybody. I knew nothing about them. They had a, I guess, a couple of depictions of radical Islamic terror. Radical Islamic terror, whether you like talking about it or not Piers, is No, I am going to come and talk about it. Because you look at what is going on, you look at what is going on in the UK, you look at what is going on all over the world And you are absolutely right about that. So you can try and shield it and say I am not shielding anything. I do just want to get one thing out of you. Go ahead. Given the amount of offence it caused, and given that you have now acknowledged that you did not know who these people were they have had their accounts suspended by Twitter do you regret now those retweets and do you wish you, with hindsight, had not done it? Well, you know, look. It was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror. This was a depiction of radical Islamic terror. They were unverified videos. At least one of them was not what it seemed. But this was I did not do it, I did not go out and I did a retweet. It was a big story where you are, but it was not a big story where I am. I get that, I get that. So you are telling me something This is airing in Britain, and I want them to get to the real you. Well, I tell you, the real me is someone who loves Britain, who loves the UK, who loves I love Scotland. I wish You know, one of the biggest problems I have in winning I will not be able to get back there so often. I would love to go there, as you know before this happened, I would be there a lot. Very special people and a very special place. So I do not want to cause any difficulty for your country, that I can tell you. Can I get an apology out of you just for the retweets of Britain First? If you are telling me they are I think it would go a long way. Here is what is fair. If you are telling me these are horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that. I know nothing about them. And you would disavow yourself of people like that? I do not want to be involved with people, but you are telling me about these people, because I know nothing about these people. Thank you ENTITY. Thank you. It means a lot to people in Britain. On the issue of trade, you were very encouraging when you met Theresa May. And Barack Obama came over to Britain just before the EU referendum and said if we voted to Leave, we'd go to the back of the queue. What is your position now? Are we at the front of the queue for a new trade deal with America? So we are going to make a deal with the UK, that will be great. As you know, somewhat restricted. Because of Brexit you have a two year restriction. And when that restriction is up we are going to be your great trading partner. It is a tough restriction to have. You know for a couple of years, you have very strong lack of being able to do things. Because I know the British people and I understand the British people, and the British people wanted to have control over their country. And they do not want to have people coming from all over the world into Britain and they do not know anything about these people. And I said because of immigration, and to a certain extent because of trade, but mostly immigration, I said that Brexit is going to be a big upset and I was right. And now we have seen how it is played out. Do you believe that we are in a good position in Britain? A lot of people are still very nervous, very anxious, but hearing ENTITY of the United States saying 'There is plenty of good trade coming from me' that is a big deal to people in Britain. Well, would it be the way I negotiate? No, I would not negotiate the way it was negotiated. But I have a lot of respect for your Prime Minister, and I think they are doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude. What would you have done? I think I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it is supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out I have a lot of problems with the European Union. Yeah. You have done business with them. They are very no, it is not a question of doing business. But I will tell you, representing the United States, it is a very unfair situation. We cannot get our product in. It is very very tough. And yet they send their product to us no taxes, very little taxes, it is very unfair. I have had a lot of problems with the European Union, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade. They are not the only ones by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But the European Union has been very very unfair to the United States, and I think it'll turn out to be very much to their detriment. So are we front of the queue? Or are we behind the French? Because we are a bit worried about Emmanuel Macron who is been all over you trying to be your new best friend. No, I like him. He is a friend of mine. Em-man-u-el! He is a great guy, his wife is fantastic. I like him a lot. You know, we had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower. Well he rolled out the red carpet! My irritation with my country. We have given state visits to Bashar al-Assad, to Robert Mugabe, to Vladimir Putin and to ENTITY Xi. So the implication from them trying to ban you, is that somehow you are worse than they are. Well I had not heard about banning, but I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, they respect what I stand for. And I do stand for tough borders. I am going to come to that now, but to those who do not , what do you say to them? I do not care, I do not care. It is just one of those things. I do not say anything. You know why? Because I do not care. Let us turn to security, national security. You have been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer ISIS hard. ISIS is now out of Iraq and Syria. I mean, that is a big double success for you, right? By the way, we would have never been there with the previous administration. Are we winning the war..? And I have to say this. With the economy, had the previous administration in its own form, in a different form, or let us put it, had the Democrats won instead of being almost 50% up, they would have been 50% down, because the United States was heading in a very bad direction. Yeah, we have done very well in Iraq, we have done very well in Syria, we have hammered them. But they spread. They go all over. It is not a good situation, and nobody knows it better than the folks in the UK. You have had some tough bouts. A lot of Muslims think you hate them. That you hate Muslims. No, totally false. No, that is false. Clarify what you feel about that. I feel love for all people, but if a person's bad, we have got to do something about it. There is got to be retribution. But I have had great great relationships with Muslims, and I had good support from Muslims during my Presidential run. And I think I have good support right now. You know, it is interesting. They want to be safe also, ENTITY. And they like me because I give them security. I have a great relationship and respect for Muslims. Only 8 people were killed in American by Islamist terrorism in 2017. By comparison, domestic gun violence killed at least 30,000. There was another mass shooting in a school this week in Kentucky the 12th this year alone. Two of the worst mass shootings in American history have happened on your watch, in Las Vegas and at the church in Texas. People will be saying you are very tough on security, you want to keep Americans safe, but if you do not do anything about gun violence at all, that seems an irrational position, for somebody who wants to keep America safe. I am a very big Second Amendment person, as you know very well. But take a look at Paris, where you have very very tough gun controls, take a look at that horrible slaughter that took place at the cafes where so many people were killed. And you had these thugs come in with guns. One by one for a long time, they just killed and hundreds of people wounded to this day still in the hospitals. That was one of the worst. And you have had many of them, where there are no guns except for the bad guys. So the bad guys have the guns, and if you would have had somebody with a gun right here when they walked in so that you could have had bullets going in the other direction, you would not have had hundreds of people killed By the way, you have many of those. You look at San Bernardino, California. These guys walk in the people that they knew they walk in and they start one by one shooting them. They had no chance. But here is the difference ENTITY, they had no chance. OK, but let me give you the other side of this coin. I come from a country with very few guns. We have 32 deaths a year. In America, every day You have a lot of terrorism. Right. That is separate to it, but on the gun issue. Let me just put this to you. The Vegas shooter, Stephen Paddock, he bought 55 guns legally in the year prior to his rampage, including 13 AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, which he then equipped with bump stocks, which effectively converted them into machine guns, which are illegal. And he rained bullets down on 20,000 people in America. I remember it very well. It was terrible. Why has nothing been done to stop somebody doing that again? We do have gun control laws, and this sick person he was a sicko. I mean that is the big problem, there is sick people. If he did not have a gun he would have had a bomb or he would have something else. But he had 55 guns. The point is he would have had 55 bombs. He would have had 55 of something else. Why cannot you make it difficult for him? You know, it is an argument that people have I have heard it every different way and we can go around this argument. I am a Second Amendment person. I think you need it for security. I think it would be far worse. I think you need it for security. But again, you have had so many attacks where there was only a gun a bad person's gun going in this direction, and if you had one on the other side so many. In fact, that is a very big example. And if they had the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would have saved a lot of lives. So I get what you are saying, but I believe in the Second Amendment. Quick fire climate change. For you, is it about the science or is it about the money? The Paris Accords. I think it is about everything and I am a believer in clean air and clear water. The Paris Accord for us would have been a disaster Are you completely out of that? I am completely out of it. No way back? There could be a way back. First of all, it was a terrible deal for the United States. If they made a good deal, like if they made a good deal with TPP you know, having to do with trade there is always a chance we'd get back, but it was a terrible deal for the United States. It was unfair to the United States. Do you believe in climate change? Do you believe it exists? There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming. Right? Right. That was not working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they are setting records, so OK, they are at a record level. There were so many thing happening, ENTITY. I will tell you what I believe in. I believe in clear air. I believe in crystal clear beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris Accord, if we could go back into the Paris Accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal, As usual, they took advantage of the United States. We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel No, no, I like Emmanuel, I would love to, but it is got to be a good deal for the United States. Quick question on trophy hunting. You seemed to indicate that you have had a change of mind about this, or you'd like the administration to. I changed it. I did not want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks bought back into this. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all of the things that they are saying, where money goes toward well money in that case was going to a government which was probably taking the money, OK? I do not, I turned that order around. That was an order. I know you did. I was very pleased to see that. I turned that order around. I tweeted to congratulate you. Were you shocked? Were you shocked? I was surprised, but I also said to people you will listen to argument. And my problem with all the hysterical liberals who lie on the floor kicking and screaming all day long about you, if they actually tried to reason with you and argue with you, I noticed on that you indicated you'd changed your mind and you have now said you have That was done by a very high level government person. As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around. That same day even. Not even a day went by. No, I was not believing in conservation that People will love to hear that. A question about your health. Everyone was being led to believe that you were insane, and physically incredibly unfit. It turned out from your recent medical that you are 30/30 in your cognitive tests Which most people are not going to do too well on. Right. You have got to hand it to you. As you said 'stable genius'. Your words. I am a stable genius. And healthy. You have never had a drink, you have never smoked, you have never taken drugs. We do see lots of pictures of you with burgers and Cokes and stuff. It is an unusual diet. Do not want to change that! No, they build that up. I eat fine food, I eat really some of the finest chefs in the world. I eat healthy food. I also have some of that food on occasion. Sometimes it makes sense. Actually when you are campaigning there is a lot of sense to it because it is boom boom boom. But no, I think I eat actually quite well. Have you got an invite to the royal wedding? Have I? Yeah. Not that I know of. Would you like to go? I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple. Meghan Markle did say you were a divisive misogynist. Well, I still hope they are happy. I am going to make you happy, because your son Barron is a massive fan of my football team in London, Arsenal. That is true! And we saw pictures of him he is an Arsenal fan. We have been going through a rough patch for a long period of time. People think it is time for a change of leadership at my club. Barron, I am sure, shares my view, right? I have something for you. I have done this is an Arsenal shirt. He will be so happy. 'TRUMP 45?. We are looking for a new leader who has an attacking philosophy, who believes in a strong defensive wall and believes in winning at all costs. And only wants big trophies. Well I think that is beautiful. You know I have a son who does love this sport. He loves this sport. And he loves Arsenal, right? And it is growing very rapidly in the United States. Are you an Arsenal fan? Not particularly, no Do not kill the dream ENTITY! But I have a friend who owns Manchester United so I know exactly what I am going to do with it. Really? Wow! That will kill our special relationship! Anyway, that is for you, and if you do want to come and manage Arsenal, we would love it. That is great! That is beautiful. We will do very well! ENTITY, it is been great to catch up with you. Thank you very much for your time.

{"id": 217, "text": "Thank you for joining us. We are here in Ho Chi Minh City with the president, ENTITY, this, the last day of his landmark trip here to Vietnam. First, sir, thank you for joining us. The facts speak for themselves. The first ENTITY to visit Vietnam since the end of the war, the first ever to set foot in Hanoi, the Capital. Interested in your thoughts. You have called this a new chapter, turning the page in the relationship. What is it do you think it will mean, first for the people of Vietnam, and also for the people of the United States? Well, of course, I hope it means for the people of Vietnam continued openness and continued prosperity. This country has made a lot of progress in the last few years. The economy is diversifying. It is becoming more open to the rest of the world. Sixty percent of the people are under 30 years old. Most of them have no memory at all of the war, and they are very much oriented toward the future. They are asking themselves all kinds of fundamental questions about what the world is like now, how they are going to relate to it, what their country should be. So I hope that we have opened a new chapter, and I hope it will be good for them and good for us. Now obviously, part of the new chapter is a widely expanded economic relationship. Do you have much confidence it will go beyond that, at least in the short term? After your meeting yesterday with the leader of the Communist Party here, he referred to the United States in a daily newspaper as imperialists, said that he hoped there would be respect for the different way of doing things here. You mentioned in your speech, nationally televised here to university students, the examples of the United States in the areas of individual freedom, religious freedom, political freedom. Do you have much confidence that the Government here, as it accepts and embraces a wider economic relationship with the West, will do anything to bring progress on those other fronts? Well, I think there will be more personal freedoms. You know, I had a roundtable this morning with a lot of young people, and they were asking themselves these same questions. And I believe that as we implement this trade agreement, and then Vietnam moves toward membership in the World Trade Organization, the rule of law will become more important; openness will become more important; there will be a lot more access to the Internet and information of all kinds; and so there will be more freedom. And the question then becomes, when does it become political freedom, or will the political system try to restrict them more, as has been the case in one or two other countries? The truthful answer is, we do not know where it is going. But I think that the trend toward freedom is virtually irreversible, and these folks are too young; they are too vigorous. And as you can see in the streets, there is a lot of good will toward America here. There is a lot of interest in our country and how we are dealing with a lot of the challenges of the new century. So I believe that the trend is positive. Now, of course, the political leaders will have their debates, and I had a nice little debate with the General Secretary of the Communist Party here about our country, and I stoutly disputed that we were an imperialist country. We had never had any imperialist designs here. The conflict here was over what self-determination for the Vietnamese people really meant and what freedom and independence really meant. But we have a chance to continue that debate now in a more peaceful and more constructive way. And I think the fact that they feel free to engage us in it and then have publicity about it they did, after all, allow my speech to the country to be televised, which I think is a good sign. And the people came out in Hanoi and here in Ho Chi Minh City to see me. So and it was not me; it was the United States. There is a lot of interest and support for the United States here. So I think we are on the right direction. I want to ask you about some of the remarkable moments on this trip. If you are sitting back in the United States watching this, we see this only by the numbers: nearly 300 sets of remains returned to the United States during your Presidency; the money put into the excavation efforts. But it is numbers until you have the opportunity to see what you did yesterday, to actually go out into the field. It was overwhelming. It is very important for the American people to understand that what has made the progress in our relationship with Vietnam possible over these last 8 years has been their cooperation in our efforts to identify and recover and return home our MIA's and to resolve the POW and MIA cases. And we have resolved hundreds of them. And in the cases where we think someone's remains are located, like the site we visited we believe a plane crashed there 33 years ago; we believe a pilot's remains are there. His two sons came with me over here. And we watched all those Vietnamese people working with the American people, up to their hips in mud, digging in the ground and taking these big chunks of mud over to sifters, and watching other Vietnamese sift through the mud for any kind of metal object or any cloth object, anything that would give us a clue to whether this was, in fact, a crash site, and whether there is something more down there. It was profoundly moving to me. And it is that good-faith effort that they have made with us and by the way, we have made with them. They have 300,000 cases still unresolved. And I brought over about 350,000 pages of documents. We have another million pages of documents we can give them so they can do their own resolution of these cases. That is what is made possible this whole focus on the future and the commercial relations and the educational and health care efforts, all the other things we are doing. What were your personal thoughts? You are standing there holding pieces of the aircraft, a label from a part of the aircraft, your daughter standing next to you, crying. It did not look like you were terribly far from that yourself. And you are with these two big, grown men who last saw their father when I believe they were 6 and 8. What goes through your mind at a moment like that? Well, first, I was glad we were doing it. I think it made me very proud to be an American and proud that we had made these efforts and made this progress. I was very grateful for the cooperation we have received from the Vietnamese Government and the individual villages. You know, there were just people out there, stomping around in the mud, trying to find some trace of those boys' father. And I think, for me, it symbolized what was best about our country and what was possible in terms of the reconciliation of people who have been so bitterly divided such a long time ago. It is not done yet, you know. We still have a lot of work to do to work through all these cases. I still hope and believe that there should be more freedom within Vietnam and recognition of the courage of the people who fought in the South Vietnamese Army, as well as for the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese. And I hope and believe that the American Vietnamese community, over a million strong, can make an even greater contribution. Now, today we were at that port, and we talked about a big pharmaceutical facility owned by two Vietnamese-American women, sisters, and their presence here in the country. But there are a lot more things that the Vietnamese have to give. But again, to go back to your question, everything begins with what we saw yesterday, the attempt to identify and bring home the remains of everybody who is still here. It was an overwhelming moment, but it should make every American proud. Thank you. We need to take a quick break. But we will be back in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in just a moment to continue our interview with the ENTITY. Veterans, the ENTITY, and Vietnam I want to ask you a little bit about your personal thoughts and how your personal journey here and your thoughts on it. As a young man, you opposed the war, once wrote that you despised it. Yet as ENTITY, with the support of Vietnam veterans, you have led the effort, first to lift the trade embargo, then to normalize relations. As you come here, how do you think this visit will be viewed back in the United States, not just among the veterans' community but especially among the Vietnam veterans' community, and your own personal thoughts on sort of bridging your youth with your role now in trying to create this new relationship? Well, let me answer the two questions separately. First of all, I hope the veterans' community will view it with pride, because nothing that we have done in the last 8 years would have been possible without the support of the Vietnam veterans in the Congress and in the various veterans' organizations: Senator John Kerry; Senator Bob Kerrey; Senator John McCain; Senator Chuck Robb; Pete Peterson, our Ambassador, who was a POW for 6 1/2 years. The first 3 years, his wife did not even know he was alive. He never saw his third child until the boy was 6 years old. Pete was in Congress for a lot of this period before I named him to be the Ambassador. So I would think that the veterans' community would be very proud of this. And also, I will reiterate, none of this would have happened if it had not been for the cooperation of the Vietnamese with our attempts to resolve our outstanding POW and MIA cases. There is never been anything like it in the entire history of warfare, where two countries worked this hard, this long, invested this kind of money and effort to resolve the POW/MIA issues. So I would think, for most of our people who understand that, the central role of the American veterans in the Congress and the country had, this would be a source of great pride. For me, personally, it was interesting my overwhelming feeling when I first got here was thinking about the boys I grew up with who died in Vietnam, four of my high school classmates. And I asked Pete Peterson, when he came back, how long it took him to get beyond thinking about how it was before. And he said, Well, about an hour, he said. Then he had to deal with the challenges of being Ambassador, and he went on with life. And that is kind of what happened to me. I was the I had a few moments there where I felt I was thinking about the personal tragedies that I had been in contact with when I was a boy. And then the moment intervened, and we went on with the future. Do you think the country is at peace with this now? Even some Democrats late in the Presidential campaign this past year tried to raise questions about Governor Bush's service. Do you think the country is ready, and should this trip maybe be the final impetus for the country to move on? I hope it will be. I hope it will be. Because the war divided the Vietnamese from the Americans, but it also divided the Vietnamese one from another and still does which is why, as I said, I went out of my way to praise the heroism of the South Vietnamese soldiers, too, and the importance of the Vietnamese-Americans who supported the position we had in Vietnam so long ago and have done so well because of freedom. So we need to heal the rift within the Vietnamese community, and it divided Americans one from another. And I hope that the last 8 years and the journey we have made together in moving forward with Vietnam has helped to put an end to that. My sense is that it did, that we are that at least the rifts are nowhere near what they were 8 years ago, not to mention 10 or 20 years ago. Let us move around the world quickly. In a matter of weeks, you will hand off to the man who will succeed you, a man as yet unknown and we will get to that the portfolio on some of the most important strategic relationships in the world. I want to start first with North Korea. You had, at one point, hoped perhaps to follow Secretary Albright and visit North Korea as part of this trip, then decided in the end not enough progress was being made to justify that. Can you be as specific as possible in saying what it is you are looking for from the North Koreans in terms of the missile program and any other steps, and whether you believe it is conceivable that you still might get there before you leave office? Well, I have not made a decision about whether to go, so I will answer that first. Specifically, what we seek with the missile program is an end to the long-range missile program and an end to the exports of missiles. North Korea needs the foreign exchange money. I understand that they need the funds, and they are very good at making missiles, but the people who are most likely to buy them are those that are most likely to misuse them down the road. So that is what we are trying to do. We also want to ensure the continued vitality of this North-South dialog for which ENTITY Kim of South Korea won the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Peace Prize, and he certainly deserved it. We want that to go on. And we want to have a sense about what the way forward is with regard to North Korea's relations with us, as well as the South Koreans and the Japanese. So it is conceivable that there could still be a trip, but I just have not made a decision. The main thing is, I will hand off to my successor a much better situation than I found, because we, first of all, had to end North Korea's nuclear program, and that is what we did and worked on in '93 and '94. And we have been implementing the agreement we made with them then for the last 6 years. Now we are working on the missile program. And it appears that North Korea has made a decision that Kim Chongil has made a decision to have a more positive and open relationship with the rest of the world. And I think that is a very good thing. I think the reconciliation and the family reunifications between North and South Korea are profoundly important. Russia. You met with President Putin during the APEC meeting in Brunei. Your successor, I assume, relatively shortly after he takes office, will receive a proposal from the Russians to go even beyond anything you and the Russians have discussed. Mr. Putin, because of the obvious budget constraints in his country, wants to go to roughly 1,000 strategic warheads. Is that in the interests of the United States national security? And do you see any potential to get to that level, and also, perhaps as part of that deal, get a compromise on the ABM Treaty that would allow the missile defense program to go forward? Well, first of all, I do not want to say anything that will compromise my successor's options. I think that is important. Now, I think it is quite possible that we could agree to go down to fewer missiles in our nuclear arsenal and theirs. I think that it is important that there also be fewer warheads. That is, there is a difference between missiles and warheads. I do not think we ought to go back to highly dangerous, richly armed MIRV missiles, multiple warhead missiles. But what we have to do is to have a target design that we believe is adequate to protect the United States and that our missile component will serve. And if we do that, then we could agree with them to reduce the number of missiles. And I'd hoped that we could get that done even beforehand. So I am encouraged by that. Now, on the missile defense, I think the trick there will be somehow having the Russians and others with equity interests here believe that we all have a vested interest in trying to develop enough missile defense to stop the rogue states and terrorists from piercing the barriers not only of the United States but of Russia, China, of any other country that might want to participate. And there is a way, I think, to get this done, but it will require a lot of joint research and a lot of trust and a lot of understanding about what the problem is and how we are going to develop it. If the technology existed which would give us high levels of confidence that one or 2 or 5 or 10 missiles could be stopped from coming into the country, it would be hard to justify not putting it up. On the other hand, the reason I did not go forward is, I think it is very hard to justify wrecking the existing treaty system which has served us so well for so long, in effect, gambling that somehow, some day, some way, the technology will be there. We do not want to do that. The best way to proceed is to do the research and try to find a way to bring these other countries into this. Because, really, if you think about it, everyone should have an interest in the capacity of a country to resist the errant missile or the missile that would be fired by a rogue state or a terrorist. And they can do this together. What I tried to do was to buy some time so my successor could sit down with the Russians, with the Chinese, with any others who are parties and interests and our European allies, of course and try to plot out a future that would leave us safer than we are today. The whole point is to keep getting safer, not to do different things but to have a system which leads to a safer world. And we have to consider what the impact of all these things are on the Indian subcontinent, where there are nuclear missiles; on the Chinese who might decide to build acquire a lot more missiles or develop them or not. And so my successor will have time to do all that. And I hope we have given the next President and our partners the maximum number of options. We need to take another short break, but when we come back, we will ask the ENTITY about his thoughts on the crisis in the Middle East, as well as the contested Presidential election back home in the United States. I want to ask you, lastly, before asking you about the domestic political situation, I want to ask you lastly about the Middle East. You met separately with Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Barak before you came on this trip. It has to be a source of enormous personal frustration to you, because of all the time you have put into this. Do you have any reasonable hopes that you can bring the two of them together anytime soon and that we will get anywhere beyond perhaps even just calming the violence before you leave office, and anywhere back toward formal peace negotiations? Is that completely unrealistic at this time? The honest answer is, I do not know, for this reason: I do not think they can start negotiating again until we can dramatically reduce the level of violence. It is not clear to me that that is going to happen right now, although I am working very hard on it, and we have been working hard on it since I have been here. And I would not rule it out. But the tragic thing is that they are not all that far apart on a lot of these big issues and that what we have seen is a sober reminder that the old status quo was not an option. You either have to keep making things better in the Middle East, or eventually they will get worse. Is the burden on one side or the other? You came away from Sharm al-Sheikh cautiously optimistic you would stop the violence, have a cooling-off period, and then bring them back together. Obviously, they have not even been able to stop the violence. Well, believe it or not, I still think Sharm al-Sheikh was very much worth doing, because, first of all, the agreement that we reached there is pretty much what they'd have to do to get the violence back and set in motion conditions which would lead to a resumption of the peace talks. And I felt before Sharm al-Sheikh that we were slipping into a very dangerous situation regionally. And now I think that a lot of the really responsible actors in the region are also trying to get this thing shut down. But I cannot really say more than that it is a troubling, difficult, and painful situation, and we have got to find a way to end the violence. You do not have to end every single instance of it, but there has to be a dramatic reduction in the violence before the parties can talk again and make commitments again that could constitute a peace agreement. Is it possible? Yes, it is possible. It is possible because they are not that far apart. But they might as well be on the other side of the globe, as long as all the shooting is going on. So that is what we are working on, and I hope that a way can be found to bring it to an end. Let me bring your thoughts back home to the United States. When you left on this trip, there was a dispute about who the next President would be. When you made your courtesy call on the Vietnamese President last night, you had to joke that you were hurrying home to see if the country had a Presidentelect. The recount continues, and along with it, the partisan rhetoric escalates. You have people on the Republican side speaking for Governor Bush saying the Democrats are trying to steal the election; Democrats on the other hand, saying that the Republicans are trying to deny the people a fair count of the vote and shut down democracy. Is this helpful, in your view? The process is obviously not pretty. Is it helpful what we are hearing from both sides? Well, first of all, I do not know that that is a particularly useful question, with all respect. You cannot , as close as this is now it appears that, when all the votes are counted, that Vice President Gore will have won a plurality of the popular vote. It appears that unless he wins Florida, he will be three votes short in the electoral college. Therefore, everything is on Florida. And Mr. Bush has the narrowest of leads out of 6 million votes, far less than a tenth of a percent, one-sixth of one-tenth of one percent, or something like that. Now, in an environment like that, you have to assume that either side will try to make the best argument they can, because you only have a whisker of difference. I think the important thing is that there is a process underway, and it is being shepherded by the parties they are both very well represented by articulate, able people and they have recourse to the courts in Florida and the Supreme Court seems to have been willing to be prompt in its decisionmaking. So I think the American people should just let it play out, and they should understand that, with so much at stake, both sides are going to make the strongest case they can. And the only thing that I hope that all of us will keep in mind here is that we do not know who won, but we do know that when people vote, they deserve to have their votes counted, if they can be. So we ought to just respect the process and respect the fact that the advocacy will take place, and it should take place. You cannot blame either one of them for making the strongest case they can. This is not a crisis in the American system of government, because it will come to an end. It will come to an end in plenty of time for the new President to take the oath of office. There is a way of resolving these things. All these cases are in the courts, and as I said, it appears to me that they are being handled in a fairly prompt way. Some of the decisions have gone one way, some have gone another way, and we will just have to see what happens. But I think the American people ought to let this it seems to me the American people are letting this play out in an appropriate way, and that is what I think should be done. Look around the corner, though. You have considerable experience in your own right trying to govern in a very difficult environment, relations with the Republican Congress not terribly good during most of the latter half of your administrations. And now you have research being done on both sides about, well, maybe this will get thrown to the Congress, and can we disqualify electors. Do you see, A, with the election being so close, and then, B, with the very difficult fight over who wins, can whoever gets this job reasonably govern, in your view? Well, I would make two points. First of all, it is true that I faced an unusually partisan group of Republicans. But it is also true that we got a lot done. I mean, I have noticed with some pleasure, I confess, that students of American history, several of them have come out in the last few weeks saying that I had kept a higher percentage of my campaign promises than any ENTITY in modern history. And we have gotten a lot done with this Republican Congress, in spite of all the partisanship in the last 6 years. We got a balanced budget agreement. We got welfare reform. We got just this year a sweeping measure on debt relief for the world's poorest nations and any number of other things. I do not want to go through all that, but the point I want to make is that even in a difficult atmosphere, where the Congress is closely divided, and the President is elected by a narrow margin, we should not assume that they will not be able to get something done. If they are willing to work hard, fight for their positions, and then in the end, make principled compromises, quite a lot can be done. That is the first thing I want to say. The second thing is, if you look at American history, it is not inevitable that the person who wins the White House under these circumstances will have a deeply divided country. Now, in 1876, when President Hayes won, he promised to only serve one term. So we do not know whether he could have been reelected or not, when he lost the popular vote and won the electoral college. In 1824 John Quincy Adams won in the House of Representatives when he lost the popular vote, and he was voted out, although he came back and had a wonderful career opposing slavery. But when Thomas Jefferson was forced to go for many, many ballots into the House of Representatives, he came out of it as a more unifying figure, with a commitment to be more unifying. And in effect, he was so successful that he got two terms, and the opposition party, the Federalist Party, disappeared. And then two members of his party, James Madison and James Monroe, succeeded him, and they both had two terms. And arguably, that 24-year period was the biggest period of political stability in the whole history of the republic, until you had the dominance of the Republicans after the Civil War, and then Roosevelt-Truman years and the Depression and World War II. So I think you I would not I do not think we should have all these hand-wringing, dire predictions. We have got a system. It is underway, and yes, these guys are the advocates for either side are under enormous pressure. And of course, they are being pretty snippy with each other from time to time. But look, you'd expect it. I mean, 100 million people voted, and there is 1,000 votes, more or less, at stake in Florida. So everybody ought to just relax, let the process play out. But do not assume that no matter who wins and no matter what happens, it is going to be bad for America. It might be quite good, because it might be sobering for the country to realize we are in a completely new era. Nobody's got a lock on the truth. We are all trying to understand the future. It is still clear that about two-thirds of the American people want a dynamic center that pulls the people together and moves us forward. And I think we still have a fair chance to achieve that. We are short on time, indeed, out of time, but just in a sentence or two, you have been at this 8 years, and I think you have 8 weeks. What runs through your head when you get up to go to the office every day? I want to get everything done I can possibly do while I am here. And for the rest, I just feel grateful. America is in much better shape then it was 8 years ago. We got to implement the ideas and the policies that I ran on in '92 and '96. I did not do everything I wanted to do, but the overwhelming majority of things I wanted to do I was able to accomplish, and I am grateful that it worked out for the country. And then a lot of other things came up along the way which were good for the country. So I am happy now, and I am grateful. And of course, I am thrilled about Hillary's election to the Senate. And I just feel enormous gratitude. But there is still a lot of things I'd like to do, and so I will work right up to the end. ENTITY, we thank you very much for your time.

{"id": 322, "text": "ENTITY. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the time. Great to see you. Let us talk about enthusiasm first of all. Big crowd today. We still see long lines wherever you go. Right - At the same time, some polling indicates maybe the fire in the belly is not as intense this time around for some voters, especially young voters, so pivotal for your election. Right. Are you worried at all about the novelty wearing off, maybe some enthusiasm drop? Well look, 2008, obviously your first time around in some ways it was lightning in a bottle. There were so many young people who just automatically got involved and, you know, we have gone through three and a half tough years. The economy is tough, especially for young people and, yet, what I have been really encouraged about here in Virginia and all across the country, we are still seeing just tons of volunteers getting involved, a lot of passion, a lot of interest. And I think the reason is they understand in some ways this election is more important than 2008. The choice in terms of the direction we want to take the country is very stark this time, so the stakes are big, and I think people wanna finish what we started in 2008. Talk about your first few years. Is there anything you believe you failed at, not because Congress would not play ball, but that rests squarely on your shoulders that has you desperate to get that second term to atone for? Yeah, well...look, ultimately when you are ENTITY, you are always responsible, even if you have got an uncooperative Congress. We are very proud of the work we did to make sure we did not slip into a Great Depression, create over four and a half million new jobs, bring manufacturing, including the auto industry, back on its feet. But, there were a lot of things we did not get done that I think are important, making sure that we get comprehensive immigration reform done. We have done some things administratively, but I have got to help to bring the parties together to do that-- But, that is Congressional. What about you? Is there something on your list? Well, you know,...the truth is that the things I can do, um, without Congress tend to be in the foreign policy area. And, you know, in that area I have not been able to move the peace process forward in the Middle East the way I wanted. It is something we focused on very early. But the truth of the matter is, that the parties, they have got to want it as well. So, um, we have got a lot of work to do, especially in rebuilding our middle class here in this country but ultimately it is going to require people coming together and Congress working with the executive branch. What about Bain Capital? It is a big issue for the past 24 hours right now, and Mitt Romney's campaign says he left in '99, Yours says it is 2001. There is a significant difference. Is he being dishonest with the American public? Well, here is what I know: we were just talking about responsibility and as ENTITY of the United States it is pretty clear to me that I am responsible for folks who are working in the federal government, and you know, Harry Truman said the buck stops with you...now my understanding is that Mr. Romney attested to the SEC multiple times that he was the chairman, CEO and president of Bain Capital. And I think most Americans figure if you are the chairman, CEO and president of a company that you are responsible for what that company does. Ultimately Mr. Romney is going to have to answer those questions because if he aspires to be president, one of the things you learn is you are ultimately responsible for the conduct of your operations. But again, that is probably a question that he is going to have to answer and I think that is a legitimate part of the campaign. And you think he should answer that soon? Yeah, absolutely. Let us ask you, switch tables here a tiny bit. Talk about the campaign trail. I want to know, what is it you absolutely love about campaigning and what is it you hate? But, you cannot say 'being away from your family'. Haha. What I love is the interactions with people and you know it is interesting. I think sometimes Washington reporters are surprised when they see me out of Washington and, you know, I am with folks not just here in Virginia but when you also traveled in Ohio on a bus tour and you are stopping in a local bar or going to a VFW hall or this morning I had a chance to sit down with three incredible military spouses, and it gives you such energy and inspiration to hear about their lives. How they are thinking about their kids, how they are thinking about their futures. They are just good, decent people, and it gives you a lot of optimism. The thing I hate most, other than being away from my family, is sometimes, when you are on the road, you end up eating a lot of stuff that tastes really good at the time but later on in the day can catch up with you, and I am now getting to the age where being in my own bed as opposed to some other bed, is not always great for my back. It matters! Alright. Sure. Fun question for you. Yeah. Here is my fun question you, and I asked your colleague Tim Kaine this a couple weeks ago. I think it always elicits a nice response. Everybody seems to know everything about you, right? Right. The books have been written. The documentaries have been made. You are in front of the Klieg lights every single day. I asked him, tell me one thing the voters do not know, that they simply do not know about you. His answer was: I like to go out and camp. I like to be outdoors. I play the harmonica. Frankly, I am a little boring. Haha. What are you? Well, you know, it is true. I am probably a little boring too, but I cook a really mean chili. People do not know this, but Michelle can testify. Now, she will claim that I have not cooked it for about ten years, so I should not get too much credit for it. I am a surprisingly good pool player, so if you ever see me in a pool hall, do not just think that you can... Do not walk up and throw down money is what you are saying? That is what I am saying. I might end up cleaning your clock. That is a possibility. And ... I am also a pretty good doodler. See folks do not know that about me. What do you doodle? You know, I ... all kinds of things. Faces, people. So sometimes when I am in a big important international meeting and you see me writings stuff down it might be that I am just drawing some, drawing some folks. It is just Snoopy - not taking notes from Kofi Annan. Is that what it is? - Haha. ENTITY, thank you so much for the time. I appreciate it. I enjoyed it. Thank you so much.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithscottthumanabc7", "title": "Interview with Scott Thuman of ABC7", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-scott-thuman-abc7", "publication_date": "13-07-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 216, "text": "Thanks so much for being with us, ENTITY. Thank you, ENTITY. Great to be here. You unveil your regulatory reform proposal tomorrow, and from what we know it is a little bit different than some had anticipated; less consolidation of agencies than had been predicted. We have heard about turf fights among regulators and committee chairs in Congress. Does that mean in the final decision making that you listened more to political advice about what you could get done rather than what made the most sense and was most efficient economically? No. I think that what we focused on was, number one, do we have the tools to prevent the kinds of risks that we saw back in September? And our conclusion was we did not , and we had to make sure that we had a systemic risk regulator. So that is in place. We asked, do we have the resolution authority if an individual institution like an AIG breaks down, to quarantine them so that they are not bringing the whole system down? We did not have that authority; we wanted to put that in place. Did we have a means of anticipating problems and properly regulating the nonbank sector of the financial system, which obviously has grown massively over the last decade? And we concluded we did not have that power. So we got those things in place. Were we sufficiently focused on consumers? And it turned out that consumer protection, investor protection was scattered among a whole bunch of different agency; we wanted to streamline, consolidate and give somebody line responsibility for that. So what we have started off with was identifying what were the biggest problems that we had, and are we putting in place the tools to prevent the kind of crises that we have seen from happening again? But you do not Now have a single bank regulator, and some people have talked about judge shopping among banks for favorable regulation. This is something that we have been concerned about in the past. What we do have, under our proposal, is that for tier one institutions, the big institutions who, if they fail, require us to shore them up, for those folks they are going to be under a single regulatory body. When it comes to some of the smaller banks, community banks, the FDIC has done a good job on that, and we feel confident that they can continue doing what they do. So our overall concept has been not to completely abandon those aspects of the system that worked, but rather focus on those aspects of the system that did not , try to close gaps. Did, you know, any considerations of sort of politics play into it? We want to get this thing passed, and, you know, we think that speed is important. We want to do it right. We want to do it carefully. But we do not want to tilt at windmills, we want to make sure that we are getting the best possible regulatory framework in place so that we are not repeating the mistakes of the past. We know that the dynamism of capitalism comes from the interplay of risk and reward. Yeah. With this plan, you want to achieve what you think will be a healthier balance. Right. You have talked about other interventions as and used words like temporary Right. reluctant to do it Right. surgical interventions. Right. But when you add it all up AIG, Citigroup, Fannie and Freddie, the auto companies, executive compensation guidelines do you ever wonder that it is just too much messing with the engine of capitalism, and that it is going to get hard to stop messing with it? No. And I will tell you why. Most of these interventions did not start on my watch. So the auto companies, let us take as a good example, when I came in, we had already put in not me, but the previous administration had already put in $10 billion to shore up the auto companies and asked nothing for in return. Now, I had three choices. I could continue giving them money without asking anything in return, I could let them liquidate in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, or we could say, `We do not want to run your company. Would you show us a plan that allows you to stand on your own two feet, so that what we are providing is a meaningful bridge for you to get to a better future?' We chose option three. That is not something that we welcomed, and the sooner we can get out the better. I would contrast that with this financial regulatory proposal that we are putting forward. There what we are trying to do is increase the transparency and the openness that has been the signature characteristic of our sorry. Sorry, I am going to start over. I am going to start at I will contrast. Get out of here. That is the most persistent fly I have ever seen. Nice! Now, where were we? That was pretty impressive, was not it? I got it. I got the sucker. What do you think, Gibbs? That is very good. It is on it is right there. Right there. You want to film that? There it is. You were contrasting the other interventions with Right. So the so with the autos, we want to get out as soon as possible. Yeah. And I would love nothing better than to let the auto companies operate, thrive, manage themselves without us being involved. Financial regulation, I think, is different, because what we have proposed is to essentially update those regulatory tools that existed back in the 1930s that were put in place after the Great Depression to increase transparency and openness. But I think everybody would acknowledge that if we have got rules of the road, that is what makes American capitalism thrive. That is why people invest in this country because they have confidence that, if they read a prospectus, somebody's made sure that what is in there is true. If they take out a loan, that there are laws in place to make sure that they are protected. And, you know, unfortunately the growth of the nonbank sector as well as all the complexities and financial instruments outstripped those old regulatory regimes. If we can get that right, that, I think, is a permanent improvement that will enhance and not impede the operation of the free market. Many people think that for major domestic reforms like health care, that for it to be durable and successful you need bipartisan support. Do you believe that? And is it important enough to you that you are willing to tell liberals in your party that they need to accept a compromise on the so-called public option, either a co-op alternative, a fallback or one of the things that is been discussed. Well, let us focus first of all on health care, and I will talk about energy as well. My general principle is I always want bipartisan support. Whether I get bipartisan support or not for any given proposal isn'talways up to me, it has to do with the short-term political calculus and thetactics that the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans determine. WhatI do have control over is accepting bipartisan ideas, bipartisan policies. So on health care, for example, there are already a bunch of liberals who are disappointed because I did not propose a single payer plan. What I have said is that without having, despite what is been advertised, a government takeover of health care, that is not what we are we have called for. We have said that if you have got a plan in the private sector that you are happy with, you have got a doctor you are happy with, you keep that person. We are not going to be messing with that. What I have said is setting up a public option that would compete with the private sector, but, if it was offering a better product, would give a additional choice to consumers, that is going to keep insurance companies honest. Now, I understand why insurance companies would not want it, because if they are making huge profits and there is no competition, then why would not they want to keep that? I understand it, I am sympathetic. But I think the average American says to themselves, `Why is it that all these members of Congress, including all the Republican members of Congress, they have essentially a public option, they essentially have the ability to look at a menu of choices and exercise those choices; why should not ordinary Americans have that as well?' And I think that that kind of approach is sensible. But what I have also said is let us just make sure that, you know, we are open-minded. And if, for example, the cooperative idea that Kent Conrad has put forward, if that is a better way to reduce costs and help families and businesses with their health care, I am more than happy to accept those good ideas. A lot of concern about debt and deficits, as you know. Bond vigilantes people talk about, but the ordinary American people as well. That is your problem, whoever created it Yes. whether or not your health care plan adds a dime to the deficit. What can you say to reassure those people who are concerned about debt that after you have finished this round of legislating on health care that you are going to do something about that; and specifically, are you open to curbing benefits for entitlement programs, more means testing and raising the retirement age? Well, this is something that keeps me awake at night. There is no doubt that we have got a serious problem in terms of our long-term deficit and debt. I make no apologies for having acted short-term to deal with our recession. I think the vast majority of economists, conservative and liberal, felt that extraordinary interventions were necessary to prevent us from slipping into a potentially deep depression. But as soon as this economy recovers, and that means planning now and starting to take some steps now to deal with it, we are going to have to close that gap between the amount of money coming in and the money amount of money going out. I have said before and I will repeat, I believe that we can reform entitlements in a way that makes it more sustainable. But most experts will tell you that the biggest driver of those deficits is health care costs. And no matter what else I do, if health care is still going up 5, 6, 7, 8 percent a year, if it is going up three times faster than wages, then we are going to see a federal government that is broke. So how do we do that? I am open to Social Security and how we can make some tweaks to that. That is the easier challenge. I think when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, the biggest cost drivers are ones that we can reform if we look at how we are reimbursing doctors and hospitals, if we look at prevention and health IT, if we look at the concept of comparative effectiveness. Those communities that are doing a better job providing high-quality care at low cost, let us duplicate that across the system. It turns out those are in fact exactly the things that we are proposing in our health care reform plan. So if we get that done, then we have gone a long way towards solving this problem. If we do not , we are going to continue to have problems. Couple things, quickly, before we run out of time. You took your time reacting to the protests in Iran after the election. What are you watching for in the handling of those protests and in the investigation of the results to and how will that influence the dialogue that you seek to have with Iran? Well, I think first of all, it is important to understand that although there is amazing ferment taking place in Iran, that the difference between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi in terms of their actual policies may not be as great as has been advertised. Either way, we were going to be dealing with an Iranian regime that has historically been hostile to the United States, that has caused some problems in the neighborhood and is pursuing nuclear weapons. And so we have got long-term interests in having them not weaponize nuclear power and stop funding organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. And that would be true whoever came out on top in this election. The second thing that I think's important to recognize is that the easiest way for reactionary forces inside Iran to crush reformers is to say it is the US that is encouraging those reformers. So what I have said is, `Look, it is up to the Iranian people to make a decision. We are not meddling.' And, you know, ultimately the question that the leadership in Iran has to answer is their own credibility in the eyes of the Iranian people. And when you have got 100,000 people who are out on the streets peacefully protesting, and they are having to be scattered through violence and gunshots, what that tells me is the Iranian people are not convinced of the legitimacy of the election. And my hope is that the regime responds not with violence, but with a recognition that the universal principles of peaceful expression and democracy are ones that should be affirmed. Am I optimistic that that will happen? You know, I take a wait-and-see approach. Either way, it is important for the United States to engage in the tough diplomacy around those permanent security concerns that we have nuclear weapons, funding of terrorism. That is not going to go away, and I think it is important for us to make sure that we have reached out. Last question. When you and I spoke in January, you said I observed that you had not gotten much bad press. You said it is coming. Media critics would say not only has it not come, but that you have gotten such favorable press, either because of bias or because you are good box office, that it is hurting the country, because you are not being sufficiently held accountable for your policies. Assess that. It is very hard for me to swallow that one. First of all, I have got one television station entirely devoted to attacking my administration. I mean, you know, that is a pretty I assume you are talking about Fox. Well, that is a pretty big megaphone. And you'd be hard-pressed, if you watched the entire day, to find a positive story about me on that front. I think that, ultimately, my responsibility is to provide the best possible decision making on behalf of the American people at a time where we have got a lot of big problems. And, you know, we welcome people who are asking us some, you know, tough questions. And I think that I have been probably as accessible as any ENTITY in the first six months press conferences, taking questions from reporters, being held accountable, being transparent about what it is that we are trying to do. I think that, actually, the reason that people have been generally positive about what we have tried to do is they feel as if I am available and willing to answer questions, and we have not been trying to hide them all. I do think that, you know, we cannot be complacent, and that as long as we have got these tough problems in place that not only journalists, but the American people are going to keep on asking, you know, whether or not we are delivering. And they understand it is not going to take us just a few months to get out of the hole that we are in; but, you know, I suspect that as time goes on, with high unemployment, with the economy still slow, that, you know, people are going to be continuing to expect results. And I welcome that. That is why I took the job. ENTITY, thanks for making the time. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

{"id": 67, "text": "The main thing that keeps me up at night right now is we lost 8 million jobs. The month I was sworn in, we lost 750,000 jobs. We have regained about 600,000 this year so far. And if we stay on pace, hopefully we will gain several hundred thousand more. But making up for that 8 million is still going to be a challenge. Look, nobody in the White House is satisfied with where we are right now. What we absolutely are convinced of, though, is that we are on the right track. And I think that the statistics bear that out. What do you tell the person who may have voted for you, cannot find a job or got laid off since you took office, why they should still keep the Democrats in charge? If somebody's out of work right now, the only answer that I am going to have for them is when they get a job. Up until that point, from their perspective, the economic policies are not working. That is my job as ENTITY is to take responsibility for moving us in the right direction. You talk about a choice election this fall. Are you prepared for the fact that now that means your policies -- it is a referendum on you and your policies and that the voters may say, You know what, we are putting the Republicans in charge ? This is going to be a choice between the policies that got us into this mess and my policies that are getting us out of this mess. And I think if you look at the vast majority of Americans, even those who are dissatisfied with the pace of progress, they will say that the policies that got us into this mess we cannot go back to. Do you think Washington is broken? And the reason I ask you this, because when you appointed -- you did the recess appointment of Donald Berwick, you seemed to send the message of one of two things: Either you did not want a debate about health care again on Capitol Hill, which got a little raucous a year ago, or, You know what, the Senate process is broken and we have got to go around it ? You know, the fact of the matter is that I cannot play political games with the Senate on these issues. I have got a government to run. And at a certain point, we have to go ahead and just make sure that people are in place to deal with the enormous challenges that are ahead. So you are not ready to say Washington's broken. Well, here is what I am ready to say, that Washington has spent an inordinate amount of time on politics -- who is up, who is down -- and not enough on how are we delivering for the American people. The good news is that despite no cooperation from the other side, we have, over the last two years, stopped an economic free fall, stabilized the financial sector. When people are determined and are willing to take tough votes even when it is politically inconvenient, we can still get things done. I have got to leave it there. Vacation in the Gulf? I know the first lady was down there touting it in Panama City, Florida. Are we going to see you guys down there? You know, we are going to be trying to figure out where we are going to be able to take some time over the course of the summer.

{"id": 274, "text": "Good evening. Back in Louisville, about 3 days before the election, President Clinton said on this program, I will come on every 6 months. This is the 6-month anniversary. The timing is perfect. Tonight is 6 months in office for Clinton-Gore. Before we get into some what we will do is cover some current issues, talk about the budget, take calls. OK? But first, there is no way you could plan for this job, so what about it surprises you the most? It is hard to say. I have learned a lot in the last 6 months, and as much as I have followed this over 20 years, I think there are some things that you could not have anticipated. I think the thing that has surprised me most is how difficult it is, even for the President, if you are going to take on big changes and try to make big things happen, to really keep communicating exactly what you are about to the American people. And why is that hard? I think because there is so much else in the atmosphere, first; and secondly, because when you do something like this big economic plan we are pushing, only the controversy is newsworthy at a time when there is so much else to cover. So I am trying always to remind people, look, we have got as many spending cuts, or more, than tax increases; that the upper income people, people over $200,000, are paying 70 percent of the burden, and that the middle class is paying very little; the working poor are paying nothing. All the details I try to get into. But it is very difficult. And we found that the American people knew the most on February 17th, the night I announced the plan and went through it point by point, and that since then, the sort of yelling and rhetoric and screaming and back and forth, that I have lost the ability to make sure everybody knows the things I want them to know. And I feel very badly about that. Is that everybody's fault? I mean, is it your fault? Media fault? I think certainly so. I mean, I am not trying to shift responsibility away from myself. But you asked me. That is been a real surprise to me because when I was a Governor in a smaller place where lots of people knew me, even if I were doing something that was quite unpopular with the media, say, and they were criticizing me, I could always get my side out there, my points. The essential facts would be out there. And that, to me, has been the most frustrating thing. And also when you are President, you have to make a lot of tough decisions. You just have to keep lining them up and making them, whether it is base closings or the very difficult problems in the Pacific Northwest with the forests or the whole litany of things that we have done here: the POW/MIA issue and how we are going to deal with Vietnam, the FBI, the gays in the military, you name it. And they keep coming in quick succession. You cannot just say, Okay, stop the world. I am going to just work on this. I am not going to make these other decisions. You have to keep going. We were talking before we went on about Elvis Presley and isolation. And I was saying that I thought he had a more isolated life than you do. But this is an isolated life in here, is not it? It can be very isolating. Do you have to fight it? I fight it all the time. And it can be isolating for two reasons. One is there is so much to do that you have to be very disciplined about your time. And I think the more I have been in this office, the more conscious I have become of it and, I think, the more disciplined I have become about my time. But discipline means deciding things you will not do, people you will not see, calls you will not make. The second problem is, frankly, the security problem. The- How so? Well, I think the Secret Service do a very, very good job. But if your job is to keep the President from being harmed in a world full of people who may have some reason to do it, may have the means to do it, obviously the best thing would be if you put him in a bulletproof room and walked out, if you see what I mean. You could not stand that. No, I could not stand that. So they do a terrific job. But we have worked out our accommodations so that I can at least run every day. I run different routes, and we do different things. And I try to get out and see the people when I can. Is it hard to understand their job for you? It is much easier now. I really respect them; they have got a very tough job. And I make it harder because I am a real people person, you know. I like to be out there. But I think it is an important job. But if you do not spend some time with just ordinary people who tell you what they think, hey, you almost forget how to hear and how to listen and how to speak and the way that most people live. By the way, have you seen In the Line of Fire ? Yes, I watched it last night. What did you think? I thought Eastwood was terrific. I thought he was good in Unforgiven. I think he is good in this. I think he is making the best movies he is ever made. Did you like the movie? I liked the movie very much. Was it realistic? I think it was as realistic as it could be and still be a real rip-roaring thriller, you know. We helped their business a lot. Let us touch some other bases. Okay. First, today Secretary of Defense Aspin appears with what looked like the entire military in the world before Senator Nunn's committee. And Senator Nunn finishes by saying he still wants to go to Congress, but he is inclined to support it. Is this a plus for you today? I think it is a plus. The Joint Chiefs came a long way on this policy from where they were back in January when we talked. When they were almost totally against it, period. Completely against changing it at all; grudgingly said, Well, we will stop asking, and none of the things that were in this policy except for that. And I commend them. They really tried hard to come to grips with this. And they know that there are and always have been homosexuals in the service who served with real distinction. They and the Secretary of Defense deserve a lot of credit. But also, frankly, the people who argued for an even broader policy deserve a lot of credit: the Campaign for Military Service, Congressman Studds, Congressman Frank. They worked hard to try to come to grips with this. I do not think anyone was fully satisfied with the result, but I believe it is the best we can do right now. Were you in a no-win? Well, I do not know. I do not view it that way. It depends on what the standard is. I was in a no-win if the only way I win is to do exactly what I think is right and- Which would have been, sign them and let them in, right? Yes. But I think it is very important when you hear the criticism of it from the left, if you will. What I said was that I thought that status should be the judge-should not be the judge. It ought to be conduct, not your orientation. That is what the policy is now. I further said that I thought a person ought to be able to say, I am gay. And as long as they did not do anything that violated the rules, they should be able to stay. That is now true. That is only true in a restricted way. Now if you say it, it creates a presumption that you are going to do something wrong while you are in the military, but you are given the opportunity to present evidence that you will not , to convince, in effect, your commander that you will observe the rules. But I never promised to change the rules of conduct. That is in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That is the way it is. Now, to be fair to the Joint Chiefs, they agreed to go further on matters of privacy and association than I ever discussed in the campaign. So this provides dramatically increased protection and a range of privacy for present and future soldiers who happen to be homosexuals but happen to be good military people. So in other words, you filled your promise. I did, except for the fact that we were not able to do precisely what I wanted, which was to give people the freedom to acknowledge their sexual orientation as long as they were following the rules of conduct. Today if you do that, it can get you in trouble, but you have the option to convince your commander that you really are following the rules. So I do not think it goes quite as far as I wanted on statements. On the other hand, it goes quite a bit further to protect private conduct on the rules of investigation than I anticipated. What do you make of Senator Nunn in all of this? I think first of all, he does not agree with my position, but I think he is worked hard, too, to try to come to grips with the reality of this, to open his mind and heart to the arguments on both sides. And I think he feels a special stewardship for the military. He is been chairman of the Armed Services Committee for a long time. He wants to make sure that if this is going to be the policy and he is going to support it, that it is legally defensible. And I think he is doing what he thinks is his job. Do you think it will pass in the Senate? I do. I think if I had done what I wanted to do, the Senate and the House would have reversed it. How do you take-before we take a break, and then we are going to get to the economy-bashing? You know, the heat that a President takes, and you have been taking a lot of it. How do you deal with that? Well, it is all part of it. It rolls off you? Most of it rolls off of me; not all of it. If I think something is particularly unfair-the only thing that really bothers me, if you want to know the truth, is when I think that the bashing is in some area that prevents the American people from focusing on what we are doing about the things they care about that are most important, or if it undermines my ability to get things done. The criticism is a part of the job, and, frankly-you know Benjamin Franklin said a long time ago, Our critics can be our friends, for they show us our faults. Sometimes our critics show us our faults, and I try to listen and learn from my critics. But if I think they are diverting the attention of the American people from the real issues or the whole thing is undermining my ability to do what I was elected to do, that bothers me. But just to be criticized, shoot, that is part of it. We are back with President Clinton. A couple of other bases, then the economy. Where do you get your money for the floods? Where does that come from? It comes from emergency appropriations. That is, we just add it to our spending this year. That is the way we have traditionally handled emergencies in America. And this year, thankfully, our deficit is well down because the interest rates have come down so much that we expect a big drop in the deficit over and above what we thought it would be. So it is going to be $2.5 billion almost in some States- Well, we have upped our request to almost $3 billion now, and it may have to be revised upward again. Keep in mind, we cannot hold harmless everybody from every loss, but there are programs to help businesses, farms, communities, and individuals who are out of work and who have no means of support. Can you waive the State matching funds? I can do it. I can waive it, or we can write it down some. What are you going to do? It depends on what the facts of each State are, how much problem they have got, how much of a burden it would be. It will be State by State? Yes, we will have to look at it on a State-by-State basis, I think. I think that is the only fair way to do it. Was it hard to fire Mr. Sessions? It was not hard, but it was sad for me. I admire the FBI greatly. I had a lot of contact with former FBI officers, had several of them in my administration. My criminal justice adviser was once the number two man in the FBI. My chief of staff for some time was a retired FBI agent. I love the FBI, and I hated to be the first President ever to have to fire a Director. But he said that that is the way he wanted it. He refused to resign, and I felt I had no choice. I do think that Louis Freeh, the Federal judge whom I appointed today, will be a sterling FBI Director. The word is, this guy, where is he been? This guy is, like, flawless. Well, he is an amazing man. I mean, he grew up in a working-class family in Jersey City. He married a wonderful girl from Pittsburgh, whose dad was a steel worker. He worked his way through law school. He is my kind of guy, you know, just from the heartland. That flawless is the quote from the guy who did the investigation. Absolutely. Well, then he was a great FBI agent, and then he was a prosecutor. He did the Pizza Connection case which was then the biggest heroin ring ever broken in the United States. He investigated a seafront corruption and brought indictments against 125 people. And then that awful mail bombing-two murders in the South, the Federal judge, the civil rights leader-he broke that case when people thought it could never be broken, and then he prosecuted it himself. He has really been an amazing success, and as you know, President Bush made him a Federal judge. And I think it is really a testimony to his character that he was willing to leave a lifetime job to be Director of the FBI, because he knew the Agency needed him. He is also very big in the area of civil rights, is he not? That is right. That was a big thing with me. I wanted somebody who was tough on crime, but who knew the FBI had to bring in more women and minorities. They have been behind on that. And they are moving, and I want to give Judge Sessions credit for that. He did a good job on that, trying to open the Bureau, and Judge Freeh said he'd continue it. Do you expect Judge Ginsburg to be approved easily? Yes. I am very proud of her, and she did real well today, I think. She is an extraordinary woman, as a real pioneer in women's rights, but also, I think, has been a judge in the best sense. She is very hard to categorize as liberal or conservative, but she will take a tough decision when she thinks it is right. On your key issue, though, which you said in the campaign, of freedom of choice, you think she will come through? Yes. Well, she is got a real record of statement there. I did not give her any kind of litmus test in the interview; I did not think it was right. You did not ? No. But I was familiar enough with her rulings and her speeches and her statements to know how she felt about that issue. And Dr. Elders-standing with her? Absolutely. Were you at all dismayed by some of the things she said, enemy of the fetus and- Well, she is a very passionate woman. But I think you have to understand where she came from. I mean, Joycelyn Elders grew up as one of seven children in a cotton field in South Arkansas. She came from nowhere, economically anyway. Her brothers and sisters worked hard to help her get through medical school. She married a man who later became the most successful high school basketball coach in our State, very much a beloved man. And she was a doctor, a professor in the medical school when I finally, after three times, talked her into becoming the health department director. And she said, What do you want me to do? I said, I want you to fight teen pregnancy, I want you to fight AIDS, I want you to do something about environmental health, and I want us to get infant mortality down. And she found that her passion, in effect, drove her. I mean, she is a very passionate woman. And sometimes she says things in stark and blunt terms that make people draw up. But I think it is fair to say that in our State, which is a pretty old-fashioned, conservative place, she was very popular because people believed she was fighting for children, she was fighting to reduce infant mortality, she was fighting to reduce teen pregnancy. She was not pro-abortion. And, as a matter of fact, in many years I was Governor, the number of abortions performed dropped over the previous years. So you are not-are you surprised that the far right has kind of taken off on her? No, because she is a lightning rod. They sort of took off on her in Arkansas for a while. But in the end she prevailed because people believed she cared about people. She was trying to save these kids from having babies. She was trying to reduce the infant mortality rate. She was trying to force people to do things-to change their behavior so AIDS would not be communicated. Will she prevail here, too? Will she be confirmed? I think she is an extraordinary woman. I will be very surprised if she is not confirmed. Dan Rostenkowski gets into trouble on the eve of maybe the most important time for him in your administration, because he is the spear carrier for the House side for the economic plan. How do you feel about that? What happens if he is indicted? That is a fair question because there is the possibility he could be indicted. Well, first, about that, of course, I cannot comment. I am not involved, and I should not be, and I cannot comment. I can only tell you that I have worked very closely with him and with Senator Moynihan. And he was here today continuing to work. I think, like every other American, he should be given the presumption of innocence. But what happens if this- But all I can tell you is his backbone has been a mile wide and awful stiff in this whole thing. He is been a major force in pushing for changes that will finally get this deficit under control and help us to turn our economy around. And I am going to keep working with him as long as he is here. Have you asked him about this incident at the post office? No. If something were to happen, do you have another point man in mind? I mean, will this hurt the chances of a compromise if Rostenkowski's stature is limited? Well, I do not even know how to comment on that. All I can tell you is that if he keeps working at it like he has, he is going to make a positive difference. We have to take a break, but quickly, why did you have to change your mind on the tax rates for middle income? Because after the election was over, the government of the previous administration revised upward the deficit by, oh, about $50 billion a year in each of the next 3 years. So you had no idea of that when you were running? No, I did not know it would be revised upward. So the decision I had to make was, well, are you going to live with a bigger deficit and less deficit reduction, or should you ask the middle class to pay a little? I also, frankly, did something else I did not like. I revised upward the tax burden on the wealthiest Americans, and I think there is a limit beyond which you do not want to go on them either. We are going to break. We will pick up on that. We are back in the Library with President Clinton, and before we take our next call we want to pick up where we left off on, because he is taken a lot of shots on this, and it would be interesting to hear it in this setting, the other side. I just want to say that when I became President and the deficit had been estimated upward since the election quite a bit, over $125, $130 billion, I decided that we were going to have to cut more spending and raise more revenues than I had thought to get the deficit down to a point that it was manageable and to keep long-term interest rates coming down. I think that it is very important to hammer home that there is a real connection between an effort to reduce the deficit and getting these long-term interest rates down. Before the election, basically you had short-term interest rates brought way down by the Federal Reserve Board but a big gap between them and the long-term rates. And that is what determines mortgage rates, business loans, and a lot of other things. So we decided that it would be worth it to really take a tough stand to raise some more money, most of it from upper-income people but a modest amount from middle-class people, and cut more spending. And let me show you what the difference is. If you look at this chart here, if I had just stayed with the budget that I found when I took office, that is, the one adopted in the last year of President Bush's term, here is what happens to the deficit. That is the inherited deficit? This is the inherited deficit. With our plan, here is what happens to it over 5 years. Now, what you see down here is the real hitch-we can come back to this later-and that is that with all of our cuts and with the revenue increases, health care is still going up at 9 percent a year. Until we bring health care costs in line with inflation, we cannot go down to zero. When we do, we can get down to zero and balance this budget. That is why health care reform is so important. But look at the difference here. Now, let me just show you one other thing. Even though I did decide to ask for a modest tax increase on the middle class, let me just say exactly what this is. Here is a deficit reduction plan. For every $10, $5 comes in spending cuts, $4 comes from people with incomes above $100,000; that is the top 6 percent. Of this $4, seven-eighths of that comes from people with incomes above $200,000. And then $1, 1 in 10, comes from people with incomes between $30,000 and $100,000. Families with incomes below $30,000 are held harmless. So I think it is a fair and balanced package. Now, this portion, the portion the middle class pays, if anything near what the Senate bill does passes, will be about $50 a year for a family of four with an income of, let us say, between $40,000 and $50,000 a year, or about a buck a week. And all this money-all this money goes into a trust fund for 5 years to pay down the deficit. It has to be used for that. And if we miss our targets of paying down the deficit, that is, if we miss my line back here any year, I have to come back in and give new cuts, new ways to meet the deficit reduction. Now, what does this mean for the average American? It means that, as we have made progress on this, we have got the lowest interest rates in 20 years. So millions of people are refinancing their homes, refinancing their business loans. They are going to take out lower college loans, car loans, consumer loans. Millions of Americans will save far more in interest rates than they will pay in this modest tax package, even upper income people. Let me just make a couple more points. Ninety-four percent of the small businesses in this country will pay no income tax increase and will have the opportunity to get a tax cut if they simply invest more money back in their business and create jobs, because we more than double the expensing provision for small business. One final thing that is important. I just got back from this G-7 meeting, the meeting of the world's great industrial powers. For 10 years, at every meeting the United States did not have much influence because we were attacked over having such a big deficit and being greedy, taking money from all around the world to pay for it. This year, for the first time in a decade, we were complimented, not criticized, and that is why-the progress of this economic plan is why at this meeting we were able to get an agreement to lower tariffs on our manufactured products. It means hundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans if we can get all the countries in the world to agree to change the trade agreement, like the big countries have. And we have got a new trade deal with Japan where the Japanese for the first time agreed to dramatically reduce the trade deficit. By the way, did you expect that going there? No, but I hoped for it. I had an instinct that both those things could happen. Everybody said nothing is going to happen at this meeting because all of these countries are in terrible economic shape, all their leaders are unpopular. Well, they are. We have got a global economic crisis, and when people cannot make a living, when they are insecure, they are worried about losing their health care, their benefits, the ability to raise and educate their children, leaders are not going to be popular. But what happened was, there was a sense that we owed it to the people we represent to do something, to try to move this economy and create jobs and get some things going. And that spirit sort of overtook the meeting. I called several of them before we met, and I said, Everybody says we are not going to do anything, but why is that? Why do not we go and do something? We are actors; we want to get something done. And I was very pleased with it. Los Angeles, as we go back to calls for President Clinton. Hello. Well, the deficit has dropped this year about $25 billion or so below where it was estimated to be when I took office because interest rates have dropped. Therefore, what we have to pay on the accumulated debt of the country has gone down. The only reason interest rates have dropped is because we have got a serious attempt to reduce the deficit. And, again, let me just reiterate what the facts are: Seventy percent of the new taxes will be paid by people who make incomes above $200,000. No income tax increases will be paid by people who have adjusted gross incomes-individuals below $140,000, couples below $180,000. There will be no tax increase at all for people with incomes below $30,000. And this modest fuel tax will amount to about $50 a year for families with incomes of about $50,000. Now, I think that is a very modest price to pay, especially when we have spending cuts that are equal to-in fact, they will be slightly greater than, I believe, the tax increase. What kind of fuel are you going to tax? Which are we going to go with, the House or Senate, do you think? I think something closer to the Senate version. They have not been finally settled on but- Gas tax? Closer to that. There is less opposition to it. Copenhagen, Denmark. Hello. Well, let me remind you, sir, that we have had several thousand troops in Somalia. We have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the former Yugoslavia. We have done airdrops of supplies. We have always been committed to use our air power to protect your troops and any other troops. We have not wanted to get the Untied States involved in the conflict there unless there was a settlement. I have always said that we would send appropriate military personnel to be part of a United Nations enforcement of the settlement. Let me also say that the closest we ever were to settling that was when the Serbs and the Croats thought that the Europeans were going to go along with my proposal to lift the arms embargo and to make available standby air power to enforce no use of the Serbian artillery against the Muslim, the Bosnian government there while the arms embargo was being lifted. When it became obvious that I could not prevail in the United Nations because of the opposition of some of the European nations, that is when things began to deteriorate again instead of move toward peace. So I had a policy. I am disappointed that it was rejected by some of the European countries. I am grateful that the Germans and some others supported it. But we are prepared to do our part to try to resolve this. We are working weekly on it. I feel terrible about it. But I do not believe the United States needs to send a lot of troops there which might get involved in a civil war on the ground when we had a plan-which would have led, I am convinced, to a settlement-which was not accepted. If we get a settlement, as we might now under other conditions, we are prepared to do our part through the U.N. to help to enforce it. We will be back with President Clinton. This is funny, folks, what happens behind the scenes, so we will make it public for you. We had arranged with President Clinton's staff that we would finish at 10 p.m. Eastern time, one hour, and the staff had arranged it with our producers. And then President Clinton just said to me, Could we go a little longer? And I said, Sure, if you want to go a little longer, we can go another half hour. And he said he'd be happy to. So we did not do it, and I just want the staff to know that we did not do it. If you would like to do it, we would be happy to accommodate you. You offered us the opportunity this afternoon and I think at that time we did not know whether we could or not. But I'd like to do it. You are feeling refreshed? Yes, and I like answering the questions. I think that is important. By the way, before we take our next call, he did give credit to Mr. Eastwood. We did add on the break that he also wanted to give credit to John Malkovich in In the Line of Fire. He is a great villain, is not he? I mean, he was fabulous. I have not seen it yet, but they tell me it is unbelievable. Unbelievable. Rene Russo was good, too, and I'd only seen her in that Mel Gibson movie. You are a movie buff, right? I love the movies. I love the movies. What is it like when you order them here in the White House? Well, you know, they send in movies on a regular basis, so I get to see a lot of movies here. Normally, what we do is on Friday night-I normally work pretty late on Friday night, till 7, 7:30 p.m. Last Friday I worked till 8:30 p.m. And then we gather up whoever is still working late in The White House, and Hillary and I and, when Chelsea's here, Chelsea would come down and watch the movie. We like that. We are ready to go back to more phone calls for President Clinton. Again, when you come on the line, please make the question or comment right to the point. And before we take our next call, I also want to give him a chance to expound on the lady who did call. I think he looked a little-when the lady who said- She said, well, if the deficit is down, why do you need to raise any taxes. Keep in mind, we went from a $1 to a $4 trillion national debt-that is the annual deficits added up-in only 12 years, from 1980 to 1992. And we need to get that deficit down to zero as quickly as we can without collapsing the economy. You cannot do it overnight, but we have to do it over a period of years. And as we do it, that is less money we have to spend on interest on the debt and more money we can invest in creating jobs, business incentives, and education and training and new technologies, and building roads and bridges and airports and things that make a country rich and competitive in this world. So even though we are getting a break on the deficit, we are getting a break on the deficit because the financial markets are responding to our efforts to bring the deficit down. And so we cannot back up. We do not want to overdo it because that will slow the economy down, if you take too much money out at one time. But if we do it too little, then the interest rates will go up and we will be in trouble on that score again. Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Hello. Homosexuals in the Military Well, first of all, let us talk about what I did do, and then I will tell you why the argument you made is not analogous. What I did do was to give instructions to the Secretary of Defense to promulgate a policy which permits gays to serve for the first time and judges them like other service men and women on their conduct, not their sexual orientation. That is a big change. They are not going to be asked about their sexual orientation. Their privacy, including their rights of association, are going to be protected. That is, if they are seen going into a gay bar, that will not lead to an investigation of their sexual orientation. The laws against sexual misconduct will be enforced clearly and unambiguously in an even-handed way against heterosexuals and homosexuals. And if a gay person says that he or she is homosexual, while that can create a presumption that they are doing something that is prohibited and lead to their separation from service, they will be given an explicit opportunity to argue that they are honoring the code of conduct. Now that is a big change. Now, how is that different from the situation with President Truman? The real thing you ought to ask is how long did it take before African-Americans, in this case, were treated fully equally in the service? It did not just happen snap with Truman's order. It did not happen after Truman's order, and it developed a long time before Truman's order. There was an explicit open involvement of the military culture with blacks in a segregated way for a very long time before this order was issued. The same thing happened with women. One of the things that is achieved almost no notice is that during my administration the Pentagon has voted to dramatically expand the role of women in the military services, make available far more roles for them than were available before. But it did not happen overnight. It happened over a period of years as the military culture adapted to it. Now, if I had done what you suggest, if I had just said that gays could serve and whatever they do in private is their own business which I never committed to do in the campaign-I will tell you exactly what would have happened. Congress would have overturned it immediately and done it on the defense bill and in ways that would have been difficult, if not impossible, for me to veto. So the situations simply are not analogous. Congress has no intention of overturning President Truman's position, and it is something that had built up over a long period of time, not something that just entered the public debate, in effect, about a year ago. St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands. Hello. Well, it would take a legal change. I am embarrassed to tell you I do not know if it would take a change in the Constitution. I'd like to invite you to write me about it, and I will commit to you I will look into it. I know that in the case of Puerto Rico, they did have a Presidential primary, which I was very active in. And the people there were very good to me, and I am grateful for that. I have strongly supported, in the case of Puerto Rico, self-determination. That is, if they have a referendum there and they vote to continue their commonwealth status or to become independent or to become a State, whatever they decide I will support. You also support statehood for Washington, DC? I do. And I did not , frankly, until about a year and a half ago when a number of people, including Jesse Jackson, who is one of the shadow Senators for DC, pointed out to me that this community, which was once a Federal preserve entirely, now has more people than 5 States, pays more taxes than 10, and sent more soldiers into harm's way in the Persian Gulf than 20. So I think there are ways you can carve out a Federal enclave here that is still separate and apart and let the rest of those folks become a State. There are some complicated issues there. I think there is a lot of-if you had the first city-state, they try to tax people from other states, and we'd have to work though all that. And if- And if Puerto Rico wants statehood, you'd be happy to welcome them as number 51? If that is what they vote for. I think they, the people of Puerto Rico, should decide. We will be back with President Clinton. We are back on Larry King Live. Now, you would think these are two pretty powerful-the President of the United States. We are doing all right. The President had another commitment he did not know about, right? So he will be with us until the top of the hour. However, every 6 months we have a kind of rotating date, right, as promised during the campaign? And I owe you a half an hour now. And he will owe us a half an hour, so the next appearance will be 90 minutes in 6 months. Or 2 hours, as pointed out by Atlanta-they never stop-2 hours, OK. But we do thank-there was another appointment which he was unaware of and we were unaware of. So we will get to some calls quickly, and he will be returning every 6 months. He promised it during the campaign; this is the 6-month anniversary. Is it too early to have a legacy? No, I'd be happy to tell you that. Number one, I'd like to get this economy moving again, get the deficit down and start creating jobs and seeing working Americans have their incomes go up. Number two, I'd like to provide health security for all Americans. I'd like for us to join all the other advanced countries in the world and provide a system of affordable health care to all of our people. Number three, I want my national service plan to pass. It will open the doors of college education to millions of Americans for lower interest loans and give many, many of them the chance to work those loans off through service at their communities. Number four, I strongly want to pass a welfare reform bill that will move people from welfare to work and end welfare as we know it. And five, I want to reform the political system. We have already passed the motor voter bill that makes it easier for people to register and vote. Three other bills that I care very deeply about have passed one House of Congress, but not both: one, a campaign finance reform bill to lower the cost of political campaigns, reduce the influence of PAC's, and open the airwaves to debate; two, a bill that drastically opens up lobbying behavior, restricting some lobbying behavior and requiring them to report what they. spend on members of Congress; and three, the modified line-item veto, which I think will help discipline spending. So those are the things; I would like those things to be my legacy. Want NAFTA to pass, too? Very much. I strongly support-I think it means more jobs, not less. Let me just make- You disagree with Mr. Perot? I do, because keep in mind, anybody who wants to go to Mexico because they have low wages and send the products back here can do that today. Mexican tariffs on American products on average are higher than American tariffs on Mexican. Because of what President Salinas has done in lowering those tariffs in the last few years, we have gone from a $5 billion trade deficit to a $6 billion trade surplus with Mexico. They now have displaced Japan as the second biggest purchaser of American manufactured products. So I think a wealthier Mexico means more products going down there and more jobs for America. A quick call, last call. Paris, France, hello. The answer is we are doing everything we can to impose restrictions on trade with Iran. We are pressuring our allies and friends all the time not to support any government, including Iran, that supports terrorism and assassination. I am glad you brought it up. I think it is a very significant problem. I hope you will press this hard in Paris as you are pressing Washington, because that is something that all the West should be sensitive to. We must not allow Iraq, Iran, and other agents of terrorism and assassination to dominate the world politically and to terrorize innocent people. I think you are absolutely right. Thanks very much, Mr. President.

{"id": 410, "text": "Preparing for this conversation today, I realized that it was nine years ago that you first called me on my cell phone: Hello, this is ENTITY. I have just read Team of Rivals and we have to talk about Lincoln. Soon afterward, I came to see you in your Senate office. So what was it about him? What made you give your announcement speech in the shadow of the Old State Capitol? What spoke to you about Lincoln to make you say, I love this guy ? Well, look, I am from Illinois, and I spent eight years down in Springfield. So the location and the announcement, to some degree, made sense optically. My particular passion for Lincoln, though, dates back from my earliest memories of politics. And we have talked about this before-that there is no one who I believe has ever captured the soul of America more profoundly than Abraham Lincoln has. Not just his biography, of somebody who genuinely rose from nothing, self-taught, striking out along the borders of our Great Frontier. Somebody who worked with his hands and then worked with his mind, and somehow became one of the greatest writers in the English language. And I think, most importantly, somebody who was able to see humanity clearly, see the fundamental contradictions of the American experiment clearly, and yet still remain hopeful and still remain full of humor, and still have a basic sympathy for the human condition, even in the midst of a terrible war and having to make terrible decisions. And having a forgiving spirit. I mean, I could go on and on for hours about Lincoln. For me, Lincoln is like just a handful of people-a Gandhi, or a Picasso, or a Martin Luther King Jr.-who is an original and captures something essential. When Lincoln was 23 years old, and running for office the first time, he said, Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. And then, a decade later, when he was in the midst of a depression so severe that his friends took all the knives, razors, and other dangerous things from his room, he said he was more than willing to die but that he had done nothing to make any human being remember that he had lived. Is not that incredible? So how would you describe your peculiar ambition that every man has? And when did it develop? It is always dangerous to amend the words of Abraham Lincoln, but let me see if this is a friendly amendment. I actually think, when you are young, ambitions are somewhat common-you want to prove yourself. It may grow out of different life experiences. You may want to prove that you are worthy of the admiration of the demanding father. You may want to prove that you are worthy of the love of an absent father. You may want to prove that you are worthy of other kids or neighbors who were wealthier than you and teased you. You may want to prove that you are worthy of high expectations. But I do think that there is a youthful ambition that very much has to do with making your mark in the world. And I think that cuts across the experiences of a lot of people who end up achieving something significant in their field. I think, as you get older, that is when your ambitions become peculiar ... Oh, well said, sir. We can amend Lincoln. ... because I think that at a certain stage those early ambitions burn away, partly because you achieve something, you get something done, you get some notoriety. And then the particularities of who you are and what your deepest commitments are begin expressing themselves. You are not just chasing the idea of me being important, but you, rather, are chasing a particular passion. So, in my case, you could analyze me and say that my father leaving and being absent was a motivator for early ambition, trying to prove myself to this apparition who had vanished. You could argue that me being a mixed kid in a place where there were not a lot of black kids around might have spurred on my ambitions. You could go through a whole litany of things that sparked me wanting to do something important. But as I got older, then my particular ambitions started cohering around creating a world in which people of different races or backgrounds or faiths can recognize each other's humanity, or creating a world in which every kid, regardless of their background, can strive and achieve and fulfill their potential. And those particular ambitions end up being rooted not just in me wanting to prove myself, but they end up being rooted in a particular worldview, a recognition that the world only makes sense to me given my life and my background if, in fact, we are not just an assortment of tribes that can never understand each other, but that we are , rather, one common humanity that can meet and learn and love each other. And at some point politics becomes the channel for that, right? Right. For example, young F.D.R. seemed a pretty ordinary guy. At 28 he is a clerk in a law firm. He has not done anything particularly great in college or law school. He gets his first chance to run for the state legislature, and somehow, when he is out there on the campaign trail, something clicks in. William James said, At such moments, there is a voice inside which speaks and says, 'This is the real me.' And F.D.R. knew then that is what he wanted to be. I think F.D.R. is a great example of what I mean. If you look at his early life, it is ambition for ambition's sake ... Absolutely. It is like he is just checking off boxes. There is no sense of what he wants to do with power; he wants power. There is no clarity about where he wants to take his notoriety; he just wants to be famous. And there is a hunger there, right? And that is partly because of Teddy Roosevelt ... ENTITY Absolutely. Because Teddy-his distant cousin and Eleanor Roosevelt's uncle-did this, so I am going to be this at 25, I am going to be this at 30; I am going to be president. He says this at 28, but he does not have that inner ... And some of it is his mom, right? Who is just been telling him from day one ... You are the best. You are the center of the world. ENTITY You are the center of the world and all that. So there are all these things going on. And then he gets polio. And then suddenly there is this intersection between a personal crisis and what is beginning to happen in the country. And that thing in him that was great but untapped suddenly is released in a way that reflects compassion ... And empathy. ... and empathy. And the innate optimism that early on might have been cockiness now is leavened with tragedy in a way that makes that optimism that much more profound, right? There is no question. Adversity in almost all the presidents I have studied changes them. For Teddy Roosevelt, in 1884, losing his wife and his mother on the same day, in the same house. He goes to the Badlands, and he is suddenly out among people. Both he and F.D.R. had to move beyond their privileged class. Polio and his time at Warm Springs, Georgia , allowed F.D.R. to do that. And then they created a different sense of themselves, connected to other people-partly what you are talking about-wanting to make other people's lives better. Fate had dealt them an unkind hand, like it does to many, and they suddenly felt more deeply toward a wider range of people. Exactly. And so I think there is a process you go through. I found during the course of my political career on the national scene-which is relatively compressed compared to some of these other presidents-there is a point where the vanity burns away and you have had your fill of your name in the papers, or big adoring crowds, or the exercise of power. And for me that happened fairly quickly. And then you are really focused on: What am I going to get done with this strange privilege that is been granted to me? How do I make myself worthy of it? And if you do not go through that, then you start getting into trouble, because then you are just clinging to prerogatives and the power and the attention. There is an expression that my daughters use: You get thirsty. And the thirst is unquenchable. And the thirst is unquenchable. And that is what you see, I think, sometimes with somebody like a Nixon-a brilliant person who, early on, had ambitions that probably were not that different from an F.D.R., certainly not that different from an L.B.J. But that thirst overwhelms everything, and you start making decisions based solely on that. So that brings us to the question of temperament, which is probably the greatest separator in presidential leadership. There is that quote when Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who met with F.D.R. after his inauguration, famously said Roosevelt had a second-class intellect but a first-class temperament. How would you describe your temperament and why it is fit for this office if, in fact, you think it is? Well, whether it is fit for this office or not is up to historians like you to determine. I think it is fair to say that my temperament is steady-and on the buoyant side. Do you think of yourself as an extrovert? No. On the spectrum of successful politicians, I am not introverted the way some have been, but I am not an F.D.R. or a Bill Clinton, who are just constantly ... Needing the people all the time. ... in a crowd and just relishing it. I like my quiet time. There is a writer's sensibility in me sometimes, where I step back. But I do think that I am generally optimistic. I see tragedy and comedy and pain and irony and all that stuff. But in the end I think life is fascinating, and I think people are more good than bad, and I think that the possibilities of progress are real. I think people are born with that spirit. My father was orphaned when he was 10. My mother died when I was young. But despite these sorrows my father remained an optimist. And that optimism was the greatest gift he gave to me-a sense of excitement about life that has carried me through everything. Yes . . . . I think it is up to the American people and historians, et cetera, to decide. But I can tell you what I think served me well in this office, and that is this basic optimism and a capacity to take the long view on things. I do not buy the hype when everybody is saying how wonderful things are and how great I am, and I do not get too down when people say, This is a disaster and he is done for. I think I have said this before. Early in my presidency, I went to Cairo to make a speech to the Muslim world. And in the afternoon, after the speech, we took helicopters out to the pyramids. And they had emptied the pyramids for us, and we could just wander around for a couple hours the pyramids and the Sphinx. And the pyramids are one of those things that live up to the hype. They are elemental in ways that are hard to describe. And you are going to these tombs and looking at the hieroglyphics and imagining the civilization that built these iconic images. And I still remember it-because I had not been president that long at that point-thinking to myself, There were a lot of people during the period when these pyramids were built who thought they were really important. And there was the equivalent of cable news and television and newspapers and Twitter and people anguishing over their relative popularity or position at any given time. And now it is all just covered in dust and sand. And all that people know are the pyramids. Sometimes I carry with me that perspective, which tells me that my particular worries on any given day-how I am doing in the polls or what somebody is saying about me ... for good or for ill-is not particularly relevant. What is relevant is: What am I building that lasts? And here in the United States, hopefully, what we are building are not just pyramids, are not icons to one pharaoh. What we are building is a culture and a way of living together that we can look back on and say, was good, was inclusive, was kind, was innovative, was able to fulfill the dreams of as many people as possible. And that part of my temperament I think has served me well. So when you think about the importance of that part of temperament in a president, how do you view what is happening with Trump right now? Well, you know, I see Trump as a phenomenon of an expression of certain fears, certain resentments, that have been a running thread in American history. Yes, not unlike the turn of the 20th century, when so many of those same anxieties and fears had developed in the wake of the Industrial Revolution-immigration, technological change, people moving from farms to cities. Right. And so there are always going to be figures who become symbols and expressions of those fears and resentments. So he is not unique in that sense. I do not think it is a surprise for me to say that I do not think his temperament is suited for this office. But it is not something that I have to emphasize because I think the majority of the American people have figured that out. And the people are looking at his opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well. I am reminded of another moment that had to do with Team of Rivals-and you. You were in Boca Raton late in May of 2008, and somebody asked you if you'd really be willing to put into your inner circle one of your chief rivals, even if his or her spouse were an occasional pain in the butt. And then you referred to Lincoln. You said, I do not want to jump the gun, I will tell you, though, that my goal is to have the best possible government. And you explained: Lincoln basically pulled in all the people who had been running against him into his Cabinet because, whatever personal feelings there were, the issue was 'How can we get this country through this time of crisis?' And then when you chose Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state, of course, team of rivals emerged as a term to characterize her selection. It came full circle when I was at the Vernon Jordan party the night before your inauguration. Hillary came up to me and said, in a teasing way, ENTITY, this is all your fault. You are responsible for my being secretary of state. She meant Lincoln, of course, not me. But obviously your successor matters a great deal to you, as does the importance of carrying out the things that you care about. It is like a relay race, as you have said, so the next person will take over. And that is an important part of what you need to think about now. Absolutely. I am a firm believer that you do not do anything significant by yourself. Again, maybe there are exceptions. There is the Picasso or the Mozart. Yes, Teddy Roosevelt wrote that there are certain geniuses, of which he was not one. But Lincoln was one. Keats could write a poem that nobody else could write. I do not fall in that category. I marvel at those people who are true geniuses of that sort. But what I have seen in my own life is that when I get something important done it is because of a lot of other people-some who get credit, some who do not . You look at something like health care, the Affordable Care Act. And for all the controversy, we now have 20 million people who have health insurance who did not have it. It is actually proven to be more effective, cheaper than even advocates like me expected. But I still view it as a starter home, in the same way that when L.B.J. started Medicare and Medicaid, or F.D.R. started Social Security, there were a series of refinements and incremental improvements that overall made the system more sturdy. L.B.J. used to say about his domestic anti-poverty programs that made up the Great Society that it was a process, from crawling to walking to running. I think about this being a relay race in that way. I welcome the next president saying, This is a good start. Here are some additional things we should not or should be doing. Here are the things that we have learned from the first phases of this that could stand improvement. That is a good thing. To me that is not a failure on my part. That is not a criticism of me. That is the nature of how social change comes about. So in that sense I do not see myself doing this alone. But in a more granular way I think about all the people who were involved in getting that thing passed. There were staff people here, whose names nobody knows, who worked tirelessly to make this happen. They know, they know. Legislative folks, who were up on the Hill till four in the morning trying to get a particular provision done. Teams here who were crunching the numbers to figure out how we could pay for it. Members of Congress who voted for this thing knowing that the politics were really tough for them, and that they might lose their race. There were just a lot of people who ended up making enormous sacrifices-and I am the front man of the band. But it does not work without them. And that is why I was always amused that people were either skeptical or surprised that I would choose a Hillary Clinton as a secretary of state. To my mind, having somebody smart, tough, capable with her own stature, who could travel around the world and command the stage, was a huge asset. What I also knew-partly by virtue of her having served as First Lady, and partly just because I knew her and had observed her-was her dedication to the country would lead her to operate with great loyalty regardless of ... Her own ambitions. ... whatever ambitions she may have had or lingering aggravations that carried over from the campaign. I detected a note of wistfulness in the speech you gave at Springfield last February. You talked about what it was like in the legislature there when you could cross party lines and share drinks and play poker, making it harder to call your opponents fascists or idiots. It makes me want to ask: Did you absorb, back in 2010, the full impact of what Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell meant when he said that his party's most important objective would be to make you a one-term president ? Did you realize how polarized it was going to become? No. I would say that is one of the things that surprised me, mainly because we were in the midst of crisis. And I was politically aware during the Clinton presidency, so I'd watch the ways in which slash-and-burn politics had come to be the norm nationally-some of the things that Newt Gingrich had unleashed with his revolution. But that was during a period of relative quiet and prosperity. Right. So there was more freedom to play around. And so that kind of reality-TV game playing you could forgive. I expected when we were undergoing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression that there would be at least a span of time on the front end in which people would rally. And the fact that that was missing probably showed my navet?. I did not anticipate that fully. But I got educated pretty quick on it. And I do think that there has been a degree of venom and viciousness and anger that has been unleashed in our national politics that is qualitatively different in at least our modern history. And why do you think it happened? It is a combination of things. We have talked about these things before. Political gerrymandering makes the incentive for most members of Congress to play to the extremes of their base rather than to the center. The Balkanization of the media means that nobody is having a single conversation with a single set of agreed-upon facts and assumptions the way you had as recently as the 90s. The influence of not just big money, but dark money. The collapse of party structures. The fact that most legislators now, most members of Congress, do not live here but travel back and forth. Yeah, all these things have contributed. So when you get upset with this lack of discourse, what do you do? When F.D.R. was very upset about isolationists, when he knew we had to deal with World War II, he would actually write drafts of speeches where he would call them out by name. Yes. And then he would do Draft Two, Draft Three, Draft Four, and one of his young speechwriters said, Oh, my God, you cannot say this. And then by Draft Six, the offending phrase was gone. Lincoln, as you know, wrote hot letters to people. And then he'd cool down and did not send them. Have you ever written any drafts of speeches or hot letters? I do it all the time. What do you mean you do it all the time? I do it all the time. I will write a response-a full rant. No kidding? And then I will crumple it up. Every once in a while, my team here will hear me go on a rant. Generally speaking, people who know me will tell you that my public persona is not that different from my private persona. I am who I am. You sort of get what you see with me. The two exceptions are that I curse more than I should, and I find myself cursing more in this office than I had in my previous life. And fortunately both my chief of staff and my national-security adviser have even bigger potty mouths than me, so it is O.K. And the second thing is that I can be much more sarcastic and, I think, sometimes withering in my assessments of things than I allow to show in my public life. Well, we see it sometimes. Yes, every once in a while you see it. You have said you'd rather be alive now than any other time. But do you ever wish you had been president in another era? Suppose you'd been around in Lincoln's time, when your written word would be pamphletized, when everybody would be reading the entire speech and they'd be talking to each other about it. And Teddy Roosevelt was right for the era when punchy language worked. F.D.R. was perfect for conversational style on radio, J.F.K. and Reagan for the big TV networks. And you are governing in the age of the Internet, with its divergent voices and sound bites. It is an interesting question. As I said earlier, there is a big part of me that has a writer's sensibility. And so that is how I think. That is how I pursue truth. That is how I hope to communicate truth to people. And I know that is not how it is always received. Because it gets chopped up. Or if it is too long, then it is dismissed as being professorial, or abstract, or long-winded. But I tell you what, though. I am named ENTITY. I am African-American. And I have been elected twice to this office with the majorities of the American people. So something is working. And you can tell yourself that. Somebody is reading some of these speeches. And it is interesting: I just had an exchange with a columnist who I like, but it was on the topic of using the phrase radical Islam, and the criticism that is come from some of the Republicans. And this is a columnist who is generally sympathetic and a thoughtful person but actually thought that I was underestimating the importance of having this pithy phrase that includes Islam to accurately label the nature of the threat. And he said, Well, you acknowledge all these truths, but you do it in long paragraphs, and that is not sufficient. And I took the criticism to heart. But I responded to him, saying, I refuse to give in to the notion that the American people cannot handle complicated information. Because I know the American people. I have met a lot of them. I have met a lot more of them than any columnist has, or any talking head on TV has. And they are pretty sophisticated. They are not always paying attention, and there is a lot of noise out there, but when they have the time, they are not looking to be spoken down to and there is no requirement to dumb things down. They get it. You think about the race speech that I gave in Philadelphia when the Jeremiah Wright stuff broke . That was a pretty complicated piece of business, but I think people heard me. Now there are filters, there are a lot of filters there, and so sometimes it is hard to get at folks. What I miss is just the fact that there is not a single conversation, but there is just this ... It would have been easier if there were just three television networks. Right. So I do not need to go back to Lincoln. If I just had what Reagan had, then the concentrated power of the bully pulpit would be an enormous advantage. I think part of the reason that I have been successful, though, despite maybe not always fitting my message into the pre-packaged formulas, is there is this whole other media ecology out there of the Internet and Instagram and memes and talk shows and comedy, and I am pretty good at that. I maybe the long-winded speeches that not everybody reads, but I can also do a slow jam on Jimmy Fallon better than most. You are proud of that, are not you? No, no, no, I mean- I am teasing you. I mean, I have fun with it sometimes. But it actually serves a purpose because I can-I think I have a pretty good take on popular culture that maybe makes up for the fact that I am not a sound-bite politician for the nightly news. And as a consequence I think I am able to reach a lot of folks, despite the fact that the conventional news media sometimes says, You know, this speech is too long, or It is too complicated, or He needs to have better sound bites, or what have you. Because they are not seeing me on Between Two Ferns trying to sell the Affordable Care Act to young people, and the fact that we are getting millions of hits on something that is not on conventional TV. So what do you regret the most that you wish you had done-or that you might have been able to deal better with? Oh, look, the list of things I wish I had gotten done is long. I do not mean what you did not get done, but what you might have done differently. ENTITY What I might have done differently. Yes, even that list is perpetually renewing itself because each day I say, Maybe if I had done that just a little bit different or that a little bit better. I know there are problems that I say to myself, If maybe I was a little more gifted I might have been able to solve. But that is not because I believe what I did was a mistake. It is that maybe it required the talents of a Lincoln. So when I think about the polarization that occurred in 2009 and 2010, I have gone back and I have looked at my proposals and my speeches and the steps we took to reach out to Congress. And the notion that we were not engaging Congress, or that we were overly partisan, or we did not schmooze enough, or we did not reach out enough to Republicans-that whole narrative just is not true. But that narrative took hold, right? What I can say is maybe if I had the genius of an Abraham Lincoln, or the charm of F.D.R. ... Or, like Lyndon Johnson, you had them over every night for dinner. Or the energy of Teddy Roosevelt, or the legislative acumen of L.B.J., or all those things wrapped into one, maybe things would have turned out differently. On the other hand, when I read history, I what typically happens to presidents and the other party during tumultuous times and how ... people react when the economy is collapsing and they are losing their homes, losing their pensions-it sort of tracks, what ended up happening, because some of that is human nature. So I guess my point is that there are always things that I think I wish I could have done better. I wish I could have persuaded the public more or my colleagues more, here in Washington, around a particular course of action. But there are not a lot of situations where I look back and I say, The decision I actually made or the course we actually pursued was the wrong course. That is what F.D.R. used to say: I think of the things that have come before me during the day and the decisions that I have made, I say to myself-well, I have done the best I could and turn over and go to sleep. Exactly. Another good example of that is the situation in Syria, which haunts me constantly. I would say of all the things that have happened during the course of my presidency the knowledge that you have hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed, millions who have been displaced, ask myself what might I have done differently along the course of the last five, six years. The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong. The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to Syrian rebels-that somehow that would have led to Assad's overthrow more decisively. The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out-that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about. But I do ask myself, Was there something that we had not thought of? Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out? So that is the kind of thing that tends to occupy me when I have the time to think about it-mainly because I think that in this job one of the things you realize is there are problems that just end up being really hard and by definition the only problems that come to my desk are the ones that nobody else can solve. Usually, I am pretty good about sorting through the options and then making decisions that I am confident are the best decisions in that moment, given the information we have. But there are times where I think I wish I could have imagined a different level of insight. Was there ever a time, at the beginning of your presidency, when you were haunted? The night F.D.R. was first elected, he told his son James, All my life I have been afraid of only one thing-fire.... I am just afraid that I may not have the strength to do this job. He was a paralyzed man, so he never locked his door. Did you ever feel that? When confronting the explosion that you came into, with the recession and the difficulty we were facing? Honestly, no. And that is the only time I think F.D.R. felt it, too. And then by the next day he was O.K. Anybody who gets into bed and turns out the lights the first night in the White House probably feels a little bit of a start, where you say, Goodness ... This is me, and I am here. Right. And I have got to make a bunch of decisions. And so there is a little bit of a jolt that you feel. There was not a time where I felt fearful that I could not make the best decisions possible. The times where I had been anguished almost exclusively had to do with deploying our men and women overseas. The first Afghan decision to surge additional troops there because the situation was deteriorating. I remember giving a speech at West Point and seeing all those amazing young people and knowing that some would be sent and not every one of them would come back. Weighing that-those never get easy. But that is a feeling different than fear. It is a feeling of the weight of the decision. And a different feeling, but related, is the decisions I have had to make to launch strikes. I do not want ever to be a president who is comfortable and at ease with killing people. I do not want my generals or my defense secretary or my national-security team to ever feel deploying weapons to kill people as routine or abstract, even if the targets are bad people. And that weighs on me. So what is it going to be like when this weight is lifted? What are you going to be able to do that you have not been able to do for eight years? Well, I am hoping I can take a walk. And ... Somewhere else, not just with ... Yes, not just around and around the South Lawn with my chief of staff and my team and my dogs. What else? You drove around in a car in that comedy video with Jerry Seinfeld, right? You had not done it for a while. I am looking to negotiate to see maybe if I can take a drive somewhere at least on some open road. You mean before the end of your term? Yeah. You know, the other guys could. Franklin Roosevelt drove Churchill almost to the edge of a cliff, in Hyde Park-and Churchill was so afraid. L.B.J. had his amphibious car when he was president. He tricked me and took me in his car one day, and the Secret Service collaborated with him. L.B.J., behind the wheel, warned me, Be careful, we are going toward a lake. The brakes are not working. Well, we go into the lake: the car became a boat. Then he got so mad at me because I did not get scared. I'd figured, He is not going to die. And he said, Do not you Harvard people have enough sense to be scared? So these earlier presidents could do things like that. It seems like things have tightened. Oh, absolutely. I think since the systematic emergence of terrorism and the assassination attempts, everything has tightened. My hope is that it loosens back up once I leave. There are a couple of particular bodysurfing beaches that I have not been to in Hawaii for a long time that I want to go back to. And there are places I want to visit where if I am wearing a baseball cap and some sunglasses I think I can get away with and mingle in a crowd. But, you know, when I leave I will be 55, and I will have an entirely new chapter of my life-the work I want to do with a presidential-center library, creating a platform for the next generation of young leaders across disciplines to work together ... things that in some ways I suspect I am able to do better out of this office. You mean, having had this office. Having had this office has given me this incredible perch from which to see how the world works. The power of the office is unique and it is a humbling privilege. With that power, however, also comes a whole host of institutional constraints. There are things I cannot say. There are things that ... You mean now, but you will later. ... that I cannot say, not out of any political concerns, but out of prudential concerns of the office. There are institutional obligations I have to carry out that are important for a president of the United States to carry out, but may not always align with what I think would move the ball down the field on the issues that I care most deeply about. It must be so freeing, I think-because you now have this foundation to do the stuff you want to do, but also you are going to become more of a human being without this. That is the hope. And, look, I have no doubt that there will be moments as the next inauguration approaches where I will feel melancholy or nostalgic. And leaving all these people. And the team that you build here, the family that you build here, is powerful. But there is a reason why George Washington is always one of the top three presidents, and it is not because of his prowess as a military leader; it is not because of the incredible innovations in policy that he introduced. It is because he knew when it was time to go. And he understood that part of the experiment we were setting up was this idea that you serve the nation and then it is over, and then you are a citizen again. And that office of citizen remains important, but your ability to let go is part of the duty that you have. It is as important as taking hold of the office. That is part of our democracy. As important as taking hold of the office is letting go of the office. And they are of a piece-it is an expression of our fidelity to the ideals upon which this nation was founded. I agree. There will be perks that you will miss, I am sure. I will miss Air Force One. I will miss Marine One. I think I told you the story about Eisenhower, that he had not personally dialed a phone call for so long that when he finally was out of the presidency he picked up the phone and he hears this buzz, and he said, What is this buzz? It is the dial tone, ENTITY.

{"id": 323, "text": "ENTITY, thanks so much for having me here. Thank you very much. I have got several important issues in Russian-American bilateral relations, which we will, of course, discuss. But first, let me come back to the events which happened 65 years ago. Now, Russia is, of course, a country which lost more than 20 million people; Russia proper, 70 percent of the losses of the USSR. And it is self-sufficient to say Second World War and Russia. But it is also an important issue here. What do you tell your children, for instance, about the Second World War? Well, we have personal connections. My grandfather fought in World War II. He was part of Patton's army. And my great uncle, my grandmother's brother, was one of those who liberated Buchenwald, and so obviously, those memories are very important. And the May 9th commemoration in Russia is so important because it reminds us of the extraordinary sacrifices that the then-Soviet Union made and the strength of the alliance between the U.S. and the Russian people. In fact, our current Ambassador in Moscow, Ambassador Beyrle, his father briefly fought with the Soviet Army. He was part of U.S. operations there, was captured, escaped into the Soviet Union, and ended up fighting with the Soviet Union Army for a time. And that, I think, symbolizes how the joint Allied efforts helped to defeat fascism, and it is one of the most important military alliances of all time. Now that we are into reset, given today's certain responses, which are the common enemies of today? Well, obviously, terrorism is one of them. Immediately after the tragic events in Moscow, I called President Medvedev and pledged that the United States would work in any way that Moscow thought made sense in helping to find the perpetrators of this terrible act. We just recently had an attempted terrorist act in New York, and it is a signal, I think, that whether these activities are happening in Moscow or they are happening in New York, that countries have to work together to make sure that these terrorists are apprehended, that their networks are destroyed, that their sources of financing dry up. And no single country is going to be able to do that on their own; countries are going to have to work together. And that is something that I am very much looking to increasing cooperation between the United States and Russia. Beyond that, though, I think it is important to recognize that the whole concept of reset between U.S. and Russian relations is not just on issues of security. We have a lot of security issues that we have to discuss. Obviously, I am very proud of the START Treaty and our efforts to reduce our nuclear arsenals. But one of the things that President Medvedev and I have discussed is how can we really ramp up our commercial, our trade, our economic ties. How can we help to promote the innovation agenda in Russia? What are we doing around high-tech industries that can produce jobs and raise standards of livings for both the Russian people and the United States? And that is an area where I think you are going to see a lot of work and a lot of cooperation. One of things we are very excited about is we set up a Presidential commission with 16 active groups on everything from energy to high-tech. And I recently extended an invitation to President Medvedev to visit the United States in late June. And one of the things we hope he is going to be able to do is not just visit Washington, but also travel, for example, to Silicon Valley and see how the connections between universities and venture capital and business has been able to create some of the extraordinary inventions that all of us use today. Now that you mentioned the START Treaty, when are we going to ratify it? And what are the chances? My hope is that we ratify it this year on our side and---- During this Congress or after the election? Well, I'd like to see it happen before the election. Obviously, it is technical, and I think it is appropriate for the Senate to examine it, but we are going to be putting forward the text of the treaty, the annexes, all the necessary materials before the Senate in short order. And our hope is, is that they will be able to review it quickly and recognize that this is an important step in the efforts of both the United States and Russia to meet our obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to lower our stockpiles, at the same time as we work together to hold other countries accountable on obligations regarding the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Well, that was the point actually of signing the treaty, to save money and also to convince the rest of the world. But then after what Mr. Ahmadi-nejad had to say this week, are we convincing the rest of the world? Well, look, I think Iran and North Korea are two special cases. I think most countries around the world have recognized that the core principles of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, would say that countries are--that have nuclear weapons should try to reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons, that countries that do not have them should forgo them, and that everybody has the right to peaceful nuclear energy. That principle has been embraced by a lot of countries. And there are countries like South Africa, for example, that had gone fairly far down the path of developing a nuclear weapon and decided this did not make sense for us. North Korea and Iran are two outliers, countries that have insisted on flouting international rules and U.N. Security Council resolutions, are not cooperating the way they need to with the IAEA. And so I have been very heartened by the cooperation that we have seen so far between the United States, Russia, the other members of the P-5-plus-1, in terms of imposing the kinds of pressure and sanctions that are necessary to get Iran to choose a more responsible path that will lead it back into the heart of the international community. Having signed the treaty, and having carried out several other things within the reset framework agenda, we have achieved a better mutual understanding. How can you convert it into something of a substance in such particular area as European security? Because also, NATO is a solution for those countries which are in, but NATO is not a solution for self-sufficient countries like Russia. What is to do be done there? Well, President Medvedev has put forward some ideas about a new security architecture in Europe. We are examining them. I take them very seriously. But I think that the most important thing at this point is to work with the institutions we have to see if we can rebuild the trust that for some time had been lost. So, for example, I have been supportive of NATO-Russia consultation in a much more systematic way than has been observed over the last several years. My sense is, is that all the parties in Europe, all the members of the NATO alliance, want to have a strong, cooperative relationship with Russia. There are certain core principles that we think have to be observed within that cooperative framework: a respect for territorial integrity of internationally recognized borders, a belief that a country's core sovereignty includes its ability to choose how it allies itself, a rejection of the notion of spheres of influence, whether it is U.S. spheres or European spheres or Russian spheres. Within those broad principles, though, if you look--going back to your earlier question--the real threats against Russian well-being or U.S. well-being to a large degree are at this point much more aligned than they have ever been. It has to do with nonstate actors. It has to do with the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It has to do with environmental catastrophes. It has to do with an integrated economy in which if you see a crisis in Greece taking place that can affect world markets. These are all issues in which cooperation rather than antagonism are the order of the day. And I think President Medvedev recognizes this. I have been very impressed with him. I think he is a strong leader, a good man, very thoughtful. I find it very easy to do business with him, and I think we have established a relationship, a real trust that can be hopefully bearing fruit in the negotiations and conversations that we have in years to come. I will use this opportunity now that you mentioned Greece and the economic crisis. I had a free day yesterday preparing for this interview, so I went fishing to Maryland. I met someone called Dave Shelby, I think, the captain of the boat. I caught a 24-pounder. He said to me that he is got 30 percent less clients--well, then, of course, the fuel is up a dollar per gallon. And I was comparing his economic comments with my position, and strangely enough and luckily enough, I can actually afford more things in America these days because of the ruble which is so stronger than the--comparatively than euro and dollar were meant to be. Where do you see the dollar, given the circumstances with the global economic crisis? Would you like to see a weaker dollar--although it does not sound nice for the American public, but still? Internationally speaking, a stronger dollar? Where are you? My basic principle is to focus on the fundamentals of the economy. We have a market-based mechanism for determining the value of currencies. I think that if we have a strong U.S. economy, we are going to have a strong dollar. And obviously, we have just gone through a very difficult period; the whole world has. We have seen stabilization, and the U.S. economy is slowly strengthening in ways that, I think, if you'd asked a year ago, we might have said that it was going to take longer than it has for that stabilization to take place. I am very concerned about what is happening in Europe. But I think it is an issue that the Europeans recognize is very serious. Greece is taking some very difficult measures; at least, they have put forward a plan that calls for difficult measures. And if we can stabilize Europe, that will be good for the United States and that will be good for Russia as well. But the key point today is the degree of integration among all economies. That is why I have said, and the United States is actively pursuing, the belief that the G-20 framework is so important, that we have to recognize that China, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, all these countries that traditionally have been viewed as on the periphery of economic decisionmaking, they are now at the core--India--are huge economies. And what happens there is going to impact us in the same way that what happens in Moscow or New York is going to impact them. The G-20 shall indeed substitute the G-8? Well, my belief is, is that there is going to be a transition period, but that the G-20 represents the economic framework of the future. Lastly, so lucky to be in front of the U.S. ENTITY, but still I have to ask one last question: the adoption issue. Well, I do not support those who say, Well, Americans killing Russian children. This is not the case. Absolute majority of the children adopted from Russia have their lives here. Even more important is the fact that more and more Russians are adopting Russian children in Russia. In fact, there are more Russians than Americans these days doing such things. But then, still, 17 kids have been killed--or, well, died in this country. It is an issue, especially after this American woman sent Artem Saveliev to Russia. What is to be done? Well, first of all, obviously, what happened with the small number of children who have been adversely affected is terrible. And we cannot minimize what is happened. As you point out, there have been tens of thousands of Russian children adopted by U.S. families. The overwhelming majority are leading happy, healthy lives. But ultimately, the policy has to be what is best for children, whether they are living in Russia or they are living in the United States. What we have done is to set up a bilateral discussion between our State Department and counterparts in Russian to find out how do we create an agreement in which children are protected. And I think that is ultimately the goal. And as the father of two children, obviously, it breaks my heart to think about children who have been vulnerable, have probably already gone through difficult situations and then are subjected to even more difficult situations in the past. But as you point out, I think it is also important to recognize that in the overwhelming majority of cases, adoptions are the absolute best thing for the child. And we want to make sure that we preserve the best of the system while eliminating these abuses. ENTITY, thanks so much, indeed. I enjoyed it.

{"id": 32, "text": "ENTITY, thanks for doing this. Thank you so much. Looking at that clock, one year ago, you were just about to take the Oath of Office. Yes. And now you get this anniversary present from the voters in Massachusetts. Robert Gibbs was saying that you were surprised and frustrated by the vote. Is that accurate? Well, I think not last night, but certainly I think a lot of us were surprised about where this was going, about a week ago. So you saw it coming by then? By that time, we did. And here is my assessment of not just the vote in Massachusetts, but the mood around the country. The same thing that swept Scott Brown into office swept me into office. People are angry, and they are frustrated. Not just because of what is happened in the last year or two years, but what is happened over the last eight years. You have got really hard-working folks all across the country, who have seen their wages flat line and their incomes flat line. They feel more secure than ever. Then suddenly you have got this bank crisis in which their 401Ks are evaporating, their home values -- their single-biggest investment -- is collapsing. And here in Washington -- from their perspective -- the only thing that happens is that we bail out the banks. But you are in charge, now. No -- well -- absolutely. No, keep in mind the point that I am making here. It was the right thing to do for us to salvage the financial system, and I make no apologies for that, at all. But we knew at the time how politically toxic that was. What it gave people a sense of is, We are spending all this money, but I am not getting any help. And, Gosh -- I wanted Obama to come in there to start making sure that I was getting help; not the big special-interest and the institutions. Now if I tell them, Well, it turns out that we will actually have gotten TARP paid back and that we are going to make sure that a fee's imposed on the big banks, so that this thing will cost taxpayers not a dime, that is helpful. But it does not eliminate the sense that their voices are not heard, and that institutions are betraying them. And I think that is been expressing itself all year. And they have gotten increasingly frustrated over the course of the year. So I take complete responsibility for the fact that -- A -- we had to salvage a financial system that could have made things much worse. We had to take the steps that we did at the beginning of the year, in order to stabilize the economy. And I am actually glad to see that the economy's now growing again, and we have the prospect of a much better economy in 2010. But that does not negate the anger and the frustration that people are feeling. But a lot of the Republicans say that the anger goes beyond the bailout. The financial bailout. I was talking to Michael Steele this morning -- the Republican National Committee Chair. He says it is repudiation of your entire agenda. Well, I think if he is suggesting the people voted against credit-card reform, so that credit card companies cannot take advantage of people, or prevention of housing fraud reform, or that they were voting against national service, or they were voting against the 4 million children who have health insurance now because of the steps that we have taken. . . I do not think that is a plausible point. He is probably talking about healthcare. Well, and if he is talking about healthcare, then I think what I'd say is, Talk to all those people out there right now who have lost their healthcare during the course of this year because they have lost their jobs. Or all the small businesses have seen the premiums that they are paying going up 20-25 percent. The reason I tackled healthcare was not because this was my personal hobbyhorse. The reason I tackled it was during the course of the campaign, I traveled all across this country and I kept on hearing heart-breaking stories about families who were bankrupt because they got sick. If they had health insurance, suddenly insurance companies were doing things that were just plain wrong, and were leaving folks in an extremely vulnerable position. And I was talking to businesses who said this was unsustainable. And, by the way, when I got here and I looked at how we were going to get control of our long-term debt, I realized that there was no way for us to control our long-term debt unless we reformed how our healthcare system works. So there is no doubt that that is something that we had to do. Not because of what I hear in Washington, but because of what I have heard out in the country. But even your allies are saying you are going to have to listen to the message of the voters in Massachusetts? Listen to Evan Bayh, yesterday. He says, If you lose Massachusetts, and that is not a -- and that is not a wakeup call, there is no hope of waking up. He says basically Democrats have to reach out -- especially independents and moderates. Slow down the agenda. Because Americans just are not buying what the Democrats are selling. Well, look. I have tremendous respect for Evan, and he comes from a very tough state in Indiana. He was on your short list for Vice President. Well, he was -- which is why I say I have got a lot of respect for him. And what is absolutely true is, during the course of this year, what you have is a situation in which we have got to take a lot of steps quickly that we know are unpopular, but were necessary. And if you ask the average person what was our stimulus package, they will tell you, The bank bailout. And I can say, Well, no -- actually that started before I was sworn in, and we have managed it very well. But it does not negate that sense on peoples' part that nobody is looking after them in an extremely tough situation. So the reason I say that we are not surprised by what happened in Massachusetts is because I am frustrated, too. I am frustrated by the fact that over the last decade, we have not seen the kind of progress for middle class families that are needed. That is what I promised to deliver in the campaign. It is not something that I believe we can get done in a year. But it is something that I think we are starting to make progress on. But you also made a fundamental decision in this first year, to push through the bulk of your agenda right away. Some would say, Focus instead on the economy. Our system cannot handle too much. You took that on in your inaugural address. You said then, There are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Looking back now, do not those critics have a point? Well, the question is, What could we not have done? And I think that a lot of people would say, Health care's the one thing you did not have to do. Most of the other issues that we took on were not ones that I chose. I did not campaign on saving the financial system. Here is the problem, though. If we did not take on healthcare, then when were we going to take it on? And if we do not take it on, then when are we going to say to families when -- 2 years from now; 3 years from now; 4 years from now -- their premiums have gone up 30-40%? And have eaten into their wages. And in some cases, their health care's been dropped altogether What am I going to say to the small businesses who just decide, We cannot afford to provide healthcare to our employees? And what am I going to say to the American people when we start talking seriously about how we get our medium- and long-term deficits under control? So we have got big challenges. Fundamental challenges. Not just around healthcare, but around the fact that we have an energy system that is archaic and involves us sending billions of dollars to other countries. We have got an education system that is starting to lag behind. And we have got a financial regulatory system that is completely inadequate to control the excessive risks and irresponsible behavior of financial players all around the world. At some point, we have got to take those on. Now part of the problem we have got is that a process in Washington to actually solve problems, to talk about them in honest ways, to think about people first and not the special interests and the lobbyists who have disproportionate power here. That system is broken and when people, during the course of us taking on one of these problems like health care locks this process, it does not make them feel -- it does not make them feel real optimistic. But you are not on the campaign trail, now. You are right here in the White House. You are the head of this system. You promised transparency, putting the health care debates on C-span. It did not happen. People said he promised to get rid of earmarks. They look at the health care bill and see all these carve outs for Nebraska, for Louisiana. They say you are not living up to your promises. Well, look, there is no doubt that when I look back in the course of this year, what I am constantly balancing is how do I move on these big agendas and at the same time, try to reform a system that has a lot of bad habits built up into them. So am I satisfied with the progress that we have made on changing how Washington works, absolutely not. Could you become complicit? Well, I think that if I had to make the same choices this year about do we have to get a strong economic recovery package passed, even though that means that there are going to be some things that people stick in there at the last minute that I do not like. Do we have to make sure that we are saving the financial system so it does not collapse, even though how it was originally structured was not my preference. Do we have to tackle health care and do I believe that the end product of insurance reforms that we have been fighting for for decades, essentially a patient's bill of rights on steroids, that makes sure that people do not lose their insurance when they get sick and make sure that kids can stay on their parents' health insurance until they get their own insurance. Was fighting for those things worth it, even though there are some compromises that have to be made along the way, then I would say yes. But it sounds like you are saying -- no second thoughts on your fundamental strategy? Well look, what I would say is that first of all, I wish we had gotten it done faster because I think that if we had gotten health care done faster, people would have understood the degree to which every single day George, health care is part of a broader context of how am I going to be able to move the middle class forward in a more secure and stable way, and I think that what is happened is, is over the course of this year, there is been a fixation, an obsession in terms of the focus on the health care process in Congress that distracted from all the other things that we are trying to do to make sure that this economy is working for ordinary people. Is that going to continue, though? You are now in a situation, coming out of Massachusetts, you do not have 60 votes in the Senate right now. What is the strategy on health care going forward? Well, here is my belief, that this is not a problem that is going to go away. This was a problem whether or not we did health care this year. If we had not taken on health care, then what people would be asking right now is, why is it having promised to do something about that during the campaign, that we are seeing millions of people who have lost their health care and their premiums go up. But they are saying now, they want your health care plan to go away. It is just not popular; the majority are opposed. Well, here is what I know is that when they actually find out what is in the proposals for insurance reform, for making sure that we are making health care more affordable, those specific provisions are actually very popular. You made that speech in August. Well, and one of the things that I have learned in Washington is you have to repeat yourself a lot because . . . because unfortunately it does not penetrate. But I am determined to make sure that the issues that are making middle class families, ordinary Americans, less secure and less stable, are fixed. So how do you do it now? This strategy that a lot of people have talked about getting the House to pass the Senate bill. Speaker Pelosi yesterday seemed to say that this was kind of a non-starter. Well, here is , here is one thing I know and I just want to make sure that this is off the table. The Senate certainly should not try to jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated. People in Massachusetts spoke. He is got to be part of that process. So . . . Number one . . . That, that is point number one. I think point number two is that it is very important to look at the substance of this package and for the American people to understand that a lot of the fear mongering around this bill is not true. I would advise that we try to move quickly to coalesce around those elements of the package that people agree on. We know that we need insurance reform, that the health insurance companies are taking advantage of people. We know that we have to have some form of cost containment because if we do not , then our budgets are going to blow up and we know that small businesses are going to need help so that they can provide health insurance to their families. Those are the core, some of the core elements of, to this bill. Now I think there is some things in there that people do not like and legitimately do not like. If they think for example that there is a carve out for just one or two particular groups or interests, I think some of that, clearing out some of that under brush, moving rapidly. . . So start again with a smaller core package. Well, look, I am not going to get into the legislative strategy. First of all, my job is to. . . as president, is to send a message in terms of where we need to go. It is not to navigate how Congress& It is to set direction. It is to set direction and the direction I think that has to be set is to identify those core elements of this package and to get that done. At the same time as we recognize that what I have been doing since day one, I am now here a year -- every day what I have been worrying about is how do I get this economy back on track? Now that has not always been publicized. It has sometimes& Is that your fault? Well, what I would say is that in this environment, in this political environment, what I have not always been successful at doing is breaking through the noise and speaking directly to the American people in a way that during the campaign you could do. You know I'd I'd just get, I would not be here and I would not be bogged down with how are we negotiating this provision or that provision of a bill. I could speak directly to people and hear from them about. . . But that is going to happen as long as health care is still being negotiated. Which is which is why I think it is important to go ahead, get something done. I noticed that some of the Republicans are saying well, we actually wanted to do health care. We just did not want. . . Michael Steele said that to me this morning. Exactly. So now in fairness, I think it is important to remind everybody that part of this process was having conversations with Republicans for months and asking them what exactly they wanted to do and what their solutions were to these problems. You going to call them back in? Well, I think that if they have clear plans, and clear ideas in terms of how to move forward on certain issues, I am always open to that. Look, I have every interest in seeing a unified country solving big problems. That is something that is very much in my interest because if that happens, not only do I have a successful presidency, but more importantly the country is successful. But we are not there right now. How much of that is your fault that republicans and democrats have not come together? You know, we have a political culture that has built up over time that has gotten more and more polarized. My hope was, a year ago today when I was being sworn in, that reversing that process was going to be easier partly because we were entering into a crisis situation and I thought that the urgency of the moment would allow us to join together and make common cause. That has not happened. Some of it, frankly, is I think a strategic decision that was made on the side of the opposition that. . . But they say you made a strategic decision to hand over your agenda to democratic leaders in Congress. Well, let me finish -- let me finish the question. The -- I think that some of it had to do with a sense that the best political strategy was to simply say no. I think part of it had to do with the fact that you have got a lot of old habits and ideological baggage in Congress that have built up over time and people just are not accustomed to working together. I mean, the Senate is a classic example of an institution that works only if people are talking, listening to each other, giving ground. . . How do you make that happen? Well, you know, it is my responsibility to try to reset the tone. And I am going to have a State of the Union speech and one of my goals, I think, I spoke about this on King's birthday, the fact that I felt disappointed that we had lost some of that sense of common cause that existed a year ago and, that I have not been able to change the tone here in Washington. I am going to keep on trying though. And the reason I am going to keep on trying is, because if we cannot do that, if all that is taken place back and forth between the parties is vitriol and accusations, then what is going to end up happening is that we are going to just keep on in a direction in which families are losing ground and they become further and further disenchanted with the possibilities of politics and government can solve any problems whatsoever. Now, here is what I am not going to do though, George, because I think this is very important and it goes to a lot of the questions that you have asked. What we cannot do is simply say we are going to stand pat and avoid big problems because they are just too hard politically. Stay the course. That -- that is part of the advice I think that was given last year to me. Was, look, Washington is too polarized, it is too hard, the special interests are too powerful. You cannot get a health care bill through because the insurance companies will spend millions of dollars of advertising against it; you cannot do energy because big oil is going to be opposed; you cannot try to solve the education system because whether it is the teachers' unions or this group or that group, they are going to be disenchanted and you are just going to make your own base angry. I mean, on each of these issues, the conventional political wisdom is do not take it on. Because when you take it on, it gets ugly, people get mad, there is a lot of distortions in the system, and your poll numbers will go down. So you'd you make all the same choices today? and, and. . .aI -- look, have I made mistakes through the course of the year? Absolutely. I mean, I do not think there is been an interview in which I did not talk about some mistakes. . . It is usually about communication though. . . . about . . . It is not about policy. I do not know how we avoid taking on these big problems. Let me just give you a very simple example, just so you get a sense of why these things are so important. If you ask the American people about health care, one of the things that drives them crazy is insurance companies denying people coverage because of preexisting conditions. Well, it turns out that if you do not -- if you do not make sure that everybody has health insurance, then you cannot eliminate insurance companies -- you cannot stop insurance companies from discriminating against people because of preexisting conditions. Well, if you are going to give everybody health insurance, you have got to make sure it is affordable. So it turns out that a lot of these things are interconnected. Now, I could have said, well, we will just do what is safe. We will just take on those things that are completely noncontroversial. The problem is the things that are noncontroversial end up being the things that do not solve the problem. And this is true on every issue. The same thing is going to be true -- we are about to get into a big fight with the banks. Not only. . . On that bank fee. Not only on the bank fee issue, but also because we think it is very important to have a consumer finance regulatory authority that is willing to actually enforce the law so that people are not getting gauged on ATM withdrawals or they are not getting gouged on their credit cards or their mortgage does not have some fine print that comes up and bites them. The banks are adamantly opposed to it. Now the minute we decide to put forward a proposal like that, I guarantee you there are going to be a whole bunch of ads and a whole bunch of talking heads saying this is big government regulation. You know, part of the Obama agenda, et cetera. Well, yes. What we are saying is, is that banks should not be able to take advantage of consumers and we should have somebody who can actually enforce that. But it is going to be a fight and it is going to be controversial We are just about out of time, I just want to wrap up a couple things. You are not advocating that the House pick up the Senate bill. I think it is very important for the House to make its determinations. I think, right now, they are feeling obviously unsettled and there were a bunch of provisions in the Senate bill that they did not like, and so I cannot force them to do that. Now I will tell you, and I have said this before, that the House and the Senate bill overlap about 90 percent. Right. And so, it does seem to me that there should be a way of, after all this work and all this pain, there should be a way of taking what is best in both bills and going ahead and getting that done. Let me ask you about Haiti . Our Martha Raddatz had a report yesterday, where she showed the U.S. military being greeted by shouts of joy on the ground in Haiti . And what was interesting about it, the people there thought the U.S. government had come to take over and they were really happy about it. Martha Raddatz described it as a please occupy us atmosphere. Is that where we are headed? No. We are being very careful about working with the Haitian government. We are being very careful about working with, uh, the United Nations, which already had peacekeeping forces on the ground, to deal with the immediate emergency, search and rescue, and relief. There is going to be a longer-term agenda, which is how do you reconstruct a nation that was already incredibly impoverished. . . It is been flattened. . . . that is now been flattened, and a government that -- you know, basic records have been destroyed. I mean, imagine if suddenly Washington just collapsed. Now, there may be -- you know, some people would like that. . . That is right. But the truth is, is that just the basic instruments of government in that country are gone. We have got to help Haiti stand back up. Can we afford it? Well, I think we cannot afford not to do it because Haiti is our neighbor. I think the world looks to us as the world's sole superpower, even though sometimes they complain about us, even though they snipe at us, deep down I think they understand that to those to whom much is given, much is expected. And I think the world understands that we have some unique capacities, in terms of helping out people. I want to make sure that when America projects its power around the world, it is not seen only when it is fighting a war. It is got to also be able to help people in desperate need. And ultimately that will be good for us. That will be good for our national security over the long term. Finally, I assume this has been about the most packed year of your life. It has. The most fulfilling? Yes. And let me just sort of share with you some general reflections about this year. When I was sworn in, we did not know if the financial system was going to collapse. We were not sure how bad the job losses were going to be. They turned out to be much worse than anybody had anticipated. There were reports of a possible terrorist attack the day of the inauguration. The amount of uncertainty was enormous. And walking through that door, you know, we immediately were confronted with just stacks of tough decisions that had to be made. During the course of this year we have had to make some decisions that were unpopular. We have made some mistakes. I have personally made some mistakes. But what I can tell you is, a year later, I have never been more optimistic about the possibilities of America. I am certainly a lot more optimistic than I was a year ago. And the reason is, is this country's shown its resilience. It took a body blow, and yet people are out there still starting businesses, they are still raising families, they are still coaching little league. And, you know, I get letters, 10 a day from families. And a lot of them are heartbreaking stories. But a lot of them are just saying, you know with all the problems that we have and maybe I disagree with you on something, I am still praying for you, I am still optimistic, I still think that we can come together. If we can get through 2009, as tough a year as it was, where a pandemic flu ranked about eighth on my to do list, and ended with a attempted terrorist attack, and then a cataclysm in our neighborhood -- in Haiti . If we can come through 2009 and still not just be standing, but all kinds of good things happening out in the country, then I am very optimistic about where we can go. What I have not been able to do yet -- and this was, this was what I was hired to do -- is to close the gap between the values of the American people and the values of Washington, and the values of Wall Street. The values of our big institutions. These values -- the American people's values are sound. They are right. You know, people take responsibility for their lives, they work hard. They are doing right by their families. Our institutions are not matching up to those values. And my job over the course of this year has been to see A, if we can just solve the immediate crisis. But now I have got to spend a lot more time just focused on how do we get those things to align. And, you know, If there is one thing that I regret this year, is that we were so busy just getting stuff done and dealing with the immediate crises that were in front of us, that I think we lost some of that sense of. . .of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are and why we have to make sure those institutions are matching up with those values. And that, I do think, is a mistake of mine. I think the assumption was, if I just focus on policy, if I just focus on the, the, you know, this provision, or that law, or are we making a good, rational decision here -- That people would get it. That people will get it. And I think that, you know, what they have ended up seeing is this feeling of remoteness and detachment where, you know, there is these technocrats up here, these folks who are making decisions. Maybe some of them are good, maybe some are not , but do they really get us and what we are going through? And I think that I can do a better job of that and partly because I do believe that we are in a stronger position now than we were in a year ago. That also means, by the way, that we can spread out what we do so it is not so cram packed. It does not mean I back off the agenda of health care, or energy, or education, or financial regulatory reform, or dealing with our deficits. But it does mean that it does not have to be all on top of the other piled on. And we have got a lot more time to explain to people why we are doing what we are doing. We have a lot more time to answer critics who argue that we are not doing the right thing. But the bottom line is this -- at the end of this year I can say honestly that not only has this been the busiest time of my life, but I also think that I have never been prouder of the country, and more optimistic about the direction that we can go in the future. I am getting signaled here but how about your family? How was the year for them? They have been great. That is been a constant that I am stunned by. Is how poised, cheerful, well-adjusted the girls have been. You know, they entered into a new school halfway in the year. They have not missed a beat. They have not gotten an attitude, they have not started acting like any different than they were back in Chicago. And Michelle, I think, has been stellar. And the fact that I have dinner with them every night -- that is been the greatest blessing of the year.

{"id": 234, "text": "Thank you for speaking with us. And my first question is about your trip. You are going to Latin America, the longest trip an ENTITY has taken to the region. Why now? Why at this moment when Democrats control the Congress and there are issues that might be in their hands? Well, thank you for asking that question. This is not my first trip since I have been ENTITY I have been in traveling the neighborhood, I think, maybe three other times. But this is a long trip, and the reason why is, I want to remind people throughout our neighborhood that America cares about them. And I bring a message of hope, a message that says, we care about the human condition and a message of accomplishment. I do not know if you know this or not, but since I have been the ENTITY, our bilateral aid to Latin America has increased from 800 million to 1.6 billion. And the reason I say that is, the American taxpayer has been very generous about providing aid in our neighborhood, and most of that aid is social justice money; in other words, it is money for education and health. And yet we do not get much credit for it. And I want the taxpayers I want the American people to get credit for their generosity in Central and South America. Your daughter Jenna is writing a book about her experiences in Central America. She will be focusing on a single mother with HIV. Has she been part of your eyes and ears in the region now that she is been there for quite a while? Well, she is. First of all, I am very proud of her. She is an accomplished woman. She came back I have not seen a lot of her because she is been spending a lot of time in Central America as a UNICEF volunteer but she came back and talked to me about this young girl that she has befriended. And she is deeply concerned about alienationists in our world, and is going to try to raise some money to help the education programs there. To me, her book and her example is what America is all about. We have got compassionate people, and when we find suffering and see income disparity or see poverty, we'd like to help people lift themselves up. You have talked about the importance of free trade. Opponents of free trade in Latin America say it is one-sided and favors the U.S. Opponents of free trade in the U.S. That is right. say it is one-sided and favors those countries. So who is right, and what are you trying to do with this right now? They are both wrong. The opponents of free trade are wrong, in my judgment, because free trade a good free trade agreement and those agreements are signed by administrations and ratified by their elected assemblies fair trade agreements are beneficial to both, and that is what we want. All you have got to do is look at the trade between the United States and Mexico after the free trade agreement we signed between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. And the amount of trade has gone up appreciably, significantly. And I truly believe that one of the most effective ways to eliminate poverty is through free and fair trade. But there is no question, there is protectionist sentiments in the neighborhood and in our own Congress. And I we got the CAFTA vote by one vote in the House of Representatives, and I am going to have to work hard to get more free trade agreements through. But the fact that it is hard will not deter me from doing what I think is right. They say you are exporting American jobs. Well, that is what Americans say. I look at it differently. I think what we are doing is, we are creating opportunities for business people, small-business people, to be able to sell products in other markets, whether it be U.S. products into Central America or South America and vice versa. I also know that trade enhances the wealth of all people. I mean, it is in our interests that Mexico generate wealth so that people can make a living. If you are a person deeply concerned about immigration and as you know, this is a hot issue here in the United States does not it make sense to encourage trade so that people can find a job at home rather than feel compelled to try to find work elsewhere? And trade is you can track the success of a trade agreement and I repeat again, the success of the trade agreement with Mexico. Brazil, you are going. Ethanol seems to be at the top of the agenda. How important is this ethanol? Some analysts say that you will bring Brazil closer to the U.S.; you will develop ethanol plants in Central America and have ethanol for U.S. consumption. First of all, the alternative fuel issue is a huge issue for the United States. I mean, we are too dependent on oil. It is in our national security interests and our economic security interests and for environmental concerns to develop alternatives to gasoline. Ethanol is the is what we are investing a lot in here in the United States to do that. Brazil has been very successful, so it gives us common ground to talk. I like the idea of helping Central America, by the way, develop an ethanol industry. I think it would be good for their national security and economic security interests. But my discussion with Brazil is more than just ethanol. Brazil is a very important country in South America. We will be talking about the Doha round of global trade. I will be talking with my friend President Lula about international matters. Brazil is an international player, and the United States looks forward to working with Brazil to promote peace. Are you is free trade is this trip a way to show what the U.S. is doing and counter what other leaders might be doing? For example, Hugo Chavez, who called you the devil and says many things, said he will be in Argentina on Friday. The trip really is to remind people that we care. I do worry about the fact that some say: Well, the United States has not paid enough attention to us ; or, The United States really is not anything more than worried about terrorism. And when, in fact, the record has been a strong record. And I will be going to promote to look at programs that are have benefited from the generosity of the American people. And so it is I say, our country is a compassionate country. And there is significant connections between people inside America and people outside America. And it is in our interest that we promote those ties, and we promote and I remind people about the generosity of our country. It is not a given, by the way, that people will continue to spend that the Congress will spend money. And therefore, it is important for me to show that we are not only spending money but the effects of spending money, the positive things that are happening as we help elevate people's lives. ENTITY, I want to ask you about the conviction of Lewis Scooter Libby. Your critics are saying that his conviction makes the promise that you made to bring honor and dignity back to the White House, that this promise will go unmet. Yes, first of all, this was a lengthy trial on a serious matter, and a jury of his peers convicted him. And we have got to respect that conviction. Secondly, this is an ongoing legal matter. In other words, there is more legal procedures to take place, and, at this time, it is inappropriate for me or the administration to be issuing comments about this serious matter. On a personal note, I was sad. I was sad for a man who had worked in my administration, and particularly sad for his family. As Commander in Chief, what do you say to the veterans who have gone through a very hard time at Walter Reed and other hospitals? There are commissions; there are solutions that are being proposed. But, what do you, as Commander in Chief, say to those veterans in I say, anything other than excellent care is unacceptable. And I have been to Walter Reed a lot. There is some fantastic doctors and nurses and healers. And yet we found that there was some substandard care in part of that organization, and we are going to correct it. And I put the Commission together a series of commissions, to make sure that there that we fully understand the truth, fully elevate the problems, so we can solve them. I had Bob Dole and Donna Shalala in today. They are chairmen of this very important commission I put together that will analyze the care our soldiers get from the battlefield into the Defense Department, then into the Veterans, and then into community. And I want to make sure there is that is a seamless transition of excellent care. Muchas gracias, ENTITY.

{"id": 57, "text": "ENTITY, you have asked the world to isolate Libya by joining the United States in economic and political sanctions. Initial reaction from our friends has been lukewarm at the best- Yes. -a refusal at worst. Is it not possible the United States will be standing in isolation, as it has on other occasions when it tried to impose sanctions? That is possible. We will hope that, well, as many as possible would join. I think that I can understand that there are economic factors that are engaged here, that countries that have more trade, certainly, than we do with that country. On the other hand, they have got to weigh it against having to stay constantly on guard, literally military at their airports, a loss of tourist trade, the added cost of all these other things, too. And I think the case is so clear that if we could all stand together and isolate that country, that country would then have to change its ways. About Colonel Qadhafi, you have described him as a barbarian, as flaky. Now he is , in effect, drawn a line in the sand and warned you not to cross it. Is he likely to retaliate, maybe close those borders, keep in those 1,500 Americans that you have ordered home? No, I do not think there is any indication of that, nor would we permit him to do such a thing. But we have taken the action we have taken, and as I said last night, I will not add anything to what might be on our minds for the future. Let him wonder what is on our mind. ENTITY, when the Russians invaded Afghanistan, we imposed a grain embargo. When you came into office in 1981, you were opposed to the grain embargo, I believe, saying it was ineffective and hurt our farmers and our economy. How does that differ from economic sanctions and doing business with Libya? Well, it differs in the sense that we just picked out one particular American industry and shut that down and shot ourself in the foot in doing it. And my position was that if it ever requires us to have economic sanctions with Russia or anyone else, it should apply to all American industry and not just penalize one, particularly when the product of that one could be obtained by our heretofore trading partner in any of a number of places in the world. And that is exactly what they did, and probably permanently reduced our agricultural export market. Mention has been made of the 126 aborted terrorist acts. Can you tell us f any of those might have occurred in the United States, were aborted in the United States, or give any specifics about any individual acts that were aborted? The thing is-and this morning I have not had time after saying this last night-I realized that I had not asked for a breakdown on where these were. I have heard some things about them; and some of them, probably a couple of dozen, applied to the United States. But that could have been also United States installations overseas. So, I am going to get a breakdown on that. I wonder if I might change gears on you just a little bit, ENTITY. I wonder what you are going to say to the unemployed textile workers in the Carolinas and in Georgia the next time you visit those States as a result of your veto of that textile bill. Well, I'd say right now I have the deepest sympathy for anyone who is going to lose their position and any industry that is going to feel hardship because of this. On the other hand, we know that the protectionism would result in equally painful unemployment for other Americans in other industries; it is a two-way street. And all experience shows what happens when we go down that protectionism road. What I have asked for is an additional $100 million for our Job Training Partnership Act for us to help in retraining and even moving people who are in an industry that is maybe going to have a permanent decline. At the same time, I have to say that if you look at the recent figures, there has not been that much of a change in the textile industry in recent years. And it is true that there are a great many other countries now that are in the marketplace. But we are also going to do something that I found we had been lagging in: I had supported the multi-fiber arrangements, and that evidently we had not been enforcing as we should the quotas that exist. We have some 1,300 treaties or agreements with other countries. And I have ordered a strict maintenance of those rules. So, we are going to try to minimize any effect that this may have. But we cannot ignore the fact that protectionism, as we used it back in the beginning of the Great Depression-and I was around then-led literally to a worldwide depression. It just is not the way to go. This Smoot-Hawley tariff was the villain, in that case, that perpetuated and added to the Depression. During the debate on the textile bill, Chairman Rostenkowski said that when Congress comes back this month, he will begin work on new trade legislation. Do we need new trade legislation? Would you support it? If there is anything left to plug that we are not doing. But, as I said, we are going to-and have embarked on a rigorous program of dealing multilaterally and bilaterally with other countries-to make sure that we get a level playing field and that we do not go on putting up with unfair restrictions on our exports to other countries while we ourselves are playing the game of free trade. If we may return to Libya for a second, I was wondering what you think of the American support for your policy? ABC News has a poll out this afternoon which indicates that 87 percent of Americans approve your economic sanctions and onethird would approve some sort of military action against Libya. Well, I am glad of the first figure, and I am glad that we have support if it ever becomes necessary to do the other. The thing that I have always said about retaliation is that we must not get tempted into creating a terrorist act on our own in response to a terrorist act. But I am in a position of not being able to comment on what any future actions might be. The Libyan response this morning calls your comments last night tantamount to a declaration of war. I think if it ever came to a declaration of war, they'd be aware of the difference between what I said last night. ENTITY, to expand on that a little, as someone mentioned earlier, the response out of Europe this morning has not been promising in support of the position you took last night and the call you made for our European allies to join us in the economic sanctions. If you could have the European leaders with you this morning instead of this group of reporters, what would you say to them to try to convince them to join us in the economic sanctions? Some of the things that I said here in one of my first answers, and point out to them what the choice is. We go on living in a world in which you have to surround the docks where your ships sail from and your airports. You have to be constantly on guard against the suicide type of attack against which there is so little chance to resist or defend yourself. And the other might be very short lived if we could all isolate someone who has proven their willingness to be an international outlaw. One of the reasons given for our allies not being so quick to support us in this move is that they have much more extensive economic ties to Libya than we do. Yes, that is true. Does it make you angry or upset you at all that they are not willing to make some economic sacrifice to solve this problem? After all, after your 1981 sanctions, the U.S. gave up extensive economic ties. Well, I am not going to say I am angry. And I can understand the other when they are looking at possible unemployment. You have to remember that several of those countries have not had anything near the economic recovery that we have had, and they are lagging far behind. They already have excessive unemployment. They are still trying to get back on their feet. In that same period of 3 years, in which we have created almost 9 million new jobs, there are some of those trading partners of ours that have not created a single new job in the last 10 years. So, obviously they are torn between these two problems. At the same time, I would hope that we could persuade them that we are talking about something of short duration, that if we could all stand together in a thing of this kind, we might once and for all bring back into the fold of civilized countries these outlaws that are perpetrating the terrorist deeds. ENTITY, you just mentioned jobs. You talked about unemployment. Domestically, there is some good news today. The unemployment statistics are out for December; the trend continues downward. When will America reach that magic 5-percent number that the economists say is full employment? Well, I have asked our people to take some close looks at what is full employment anymore. It seems strange to me that we are still talking about a figure down there that has to do with the people who, through no fault of their own, are unemployed. And yet, at the same time, we have, today, virtually 110 million people employed. But the significant thing is you can say, well, also our population has increased. But the potential employment pool consists of all people, male and female, between the ages of 16 and 65. Today the highest percentage of that potential pool is employed than has ever been employed in our entire history. So, do we honestly know what the figure of full employment is? I do know that if you take the present unemployed in our country, and you go down to what could be considered possible long-term unemployment or the potentially unemployed-permanently unemployed, I should say, not potentially, you will find that only a small percentage of the unemployed have been unemployed for 26 weeks or longer. And everyone else, in other words, fits into that pool of people who are either new entrants into the job market-just as last month, when the figures showed this morning, when we increased employment by 230,000 in the last month, at the same time the job market increased by 90,000 people. So, you take those figures and bring it down to those that are obviously having problems getting a job. Most people, when you say the number of people unemployed, they think in terms of a single pool of people that are out there month after month with no job. It is an ever-changing pool, except for that little fringe at the top which is, say, at 6 months some of them even then get jobs, but they have been unemployed that long. And, so, I have been asking for some studies to find out what really is full employment. I remember some years ago we said it was 4 percent. Well, if you check back, you will Find no one did any research to determine is 4 percent the correct figure for the people that will always be either voluntarily in between jobs or just newly entering the job market. But as we take hope in 110 million people at work, is there not the danger that we will overlook what we must admit are-there are pockets of unemployment Oh, yes. -where it is absolutely devastating if not hopeless? Yes, that is why this Job Training Partnership Act that we brought about after we came in-we found that the job training programs of the past have been tremendously expensive. They were spending about as much as it would cost to go to Harvard. Not that I suggest Harvard as an answer to employment. But we found that the job training was, in many instances, training people for jobs that did not exist anywhere near their home area. So, this partnership thing is a partnership between local government, local industry, and the Federal Government to train people for the jobs that are available in their particular areas. And it has had a job placement rate tremendously higher than any other previous job training programs. So, this is what we must continue to do and even emphasize and do more, as I say, to add more to this, because, yes, the national rate of unemployment does not mean that it is evenly distributed. There are some places-well, I like whenever I am in a city, including Washington, I like to count the help wanted ads on Sunday in the Sunday paper, those pages of just column after column of employers looking for employees. Well, last week it was around 50 pages in the Washington Post. When I was out in California, it topped 60 pages in the Los Angeles Times. Now, these are employers seeking employees, and it is not that these are for great skilled jobs for which there just are not people trained for that. You look at them, and these are a cross section of everything from maids and receptionists and clerk typists and truck drivers and whatever you want to name. Now, it suggests to me also, then, that maybe the answers, as the demography changes in our country, maybe some of the answer is simply help people move, a redistribution program. And this is part of our program also. It is not only job training; but if it is an area where the whole industrial background has changed, then why not help those people get to places where there is a market for their talent. ENTITY, there is a job opening in the administration. John Block has resigned. What are your criteria for his replacement? What kind of person should it be? Farmer, businessman, politician? No, it should be just like Jack Block; somebody that is walked in the furrows he is plowed in his own ground and that is a farmer and knows about that. And this is what we will be looking for, someone with that kind of experience and firsthand knowledge of farm problems. Agriculture, Defense, so many Federal programs will be affected when and if Gramm-Rudman takes effect. One of those that is estimated will be seriously affected is the drug interdiction program along our southern borders. Perhaps half their budget might go. How does that reconcile with the priority your administration has put on drug enforcement and interdiction? Well, if I read your question correctly, I think what we are referring to here is the ultimate thing that if the Congress will not agree with proposed cuts, then an enforced cutting that is prescribed-50 percent for defense, 50 percent for the other programs. I hope we never have to come to that. If the Congress will cooperate with us in making the cuts that have to be made where we have selection over them, we will never have to resort to that sequestering of programs in which you just automatically go in with a meat-ax approach and they are automatically cut. I never favored that part of the legislation at all. We have to have a willingness to cut. And if you look at the budgeting process-you know, I squirm a little when they keep calling it the President's budget. The President's budget consists of the estimate that the people who have to run the programs under the various Cabinet departments and agencies-what they estimate it will cost them to carry out the programs that have been passed by the Congress of the United States. The President, under the Constitution, cannot spend a nickel; it is all dictated. But it is always seemed strange to me in the budgeting process. They have announced they will have a program to do something. All right. We turn it over to the people that are going to run that program. And then we sit down with them-long hours around a table like this-about what is it going to cost to achieve the purposes set out by the Congress in that program. And we arrive at a figure that the people are going to have to run the program say, This is it, and we can do it for this. Then you send it up on the Hill, and you find Congressmen who are not going to have anything to do with running the program saying, Oh, no, you got to spend more money than that. And they pass more money than we say is necessary for the-program. If I could follow up on Gramm-Rudman, because I think we will be hearing a good bit of it in the year to come, ENTITY. Some people on the Hill say that was the coward's way out, the Congress' coward's way out of the budget dilemma. Do you agree? If anything, it might have been that part where, if you cannot come to a meeting of the minds, you sequester, and it is enforced-the cutting. And no one has to take any blame for it; it is written into the law. It was not a coward's way out, if you stop to think. The thing that appealed to me-as a matter of fact, by sheer coincidence, down here in this end of town, I had brought in an idea that why do not we set up a several-year plan for planned reductions of the deficit leading to a point in the future that we can say, Here, we will have balanced the budget. And then have an amendment to the Constitution that says we have to keep it balanced. And suddenly, realize that up on the Hill are-or learned that they were talking about the same thing, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill. From that part of it, there is nothing cowardly about it. It is a disciplinary measure. If instead of every year you have to fight over the single budget, whether you can get the cuts to start whittling at that deficit, you have a program that says, All right, we are all agreed that starting here with the deficits to there, we are going to reduce them annually at a rate that gets us to zero. Then, the discipline that is exerted on all of us is that if any one of us, on our side or on their side up on the Hill wants or advocates increased spending over and above this 5-year plan, why, they are breaking ranks in a 5-year program that has a definite goal. And I think that this is something that is been lacking for a long time. If I can just follow up on that briefly. In facing this discipline, as you say, is it realistic to continue to think that the Pentagon's budget can continue where it is or increase? Well, the Congress itself, in the budget resolution, had passed a resolution that called for in 1987 a 3-percent real growth, and they had agreed to that. I think that it is proper and that we should do it. I do not think there is any way that we can retreat from what is the first and prime responsibility of the Federal Government, which is the security of the United States. Five years ago, when I came here, half the airplanes in our Air Force and in our naval force could not get off the ground on any given day because of a lack of spare parts or fuel or lack of pilots. The same thing was true of naval ships that could not leave harbor. Well, today we have got a working military. And of all the things I think I can be proud of, that is the thing I am most proud of, is the young men and women in our country today in uniform. We have not seen anything quite like it, certainly in peacetime, and in my lifetime. It is been 25 years since we have had relations with Cuba. And most of our Latin American friends and Caribbean friends have warmed relations with Fidel Castro. Some of them have normalized relations. And he is sent signals to us that he is ready to sit down and negotiate. Do you see that happening? Such signals were sent to us some time ago in our administration, and we moved immediately. And they were just signals. Nothing resulted from our attempt at having negotiations and talks with them about the problems between us. So, I think the ball is kind of in his court. If he really means it, then let him propose to us some things he is willing to talk about and redress some wrongs that need redressing. What would he have to do? Oh, I think there are a number of things: restoration of freedom to his own people, the right of those people who were driven from his country to travel back and forth and visit their families and friends, release of political prisoners. Now, we did get some exchange, a small number of those. But we also found out in the Mariel boat exodus to the United States of people-that he loaded us up with some not political prisoners, prisoners, all right, with records as long as your arm in every kind of brutal crime you can name. And we have been shipping them back to him as fast as we can. One more terrorism question. Your emphasis in the last few days on Libya and the problems with Colonel Qadhafi give the impression that he is responsible, or that his nation is responsible, for the bulk of the export of international terrorism. Number one, do you believe that? Secondly, if Mr. Qadhafi were to magically disappear from the planet Earth this evening, how much would that reduce the international terrorism problem? But I could not give you a figure on that, and I do not know that I have ever indicated that it is the bulk. There are other nations in the world that are surreptitiously helping terrorism along. But we will soon be releasing a white paper on what we know about his financial support, training, things of that kind. And we do have the evidence. Now, one thing that I can name, just as an example, because this has been out and made public already. The men who are lying in the hospital, wounded, from Rome and the Vienna undertaking, and those that died, those terrorists that died, they were carrying passports, Tunisian passports. These passports, we happen to know, were the passports that the Libyan Government confiscated from the workers in Libya who had come across the border-as people do here in our own country-to work in Libya, but were from Tunis. And then, because of some arguments he was having with the Tunisian Government, he expelled them from his country, sent them home, and confiscated their passports. So, here turn up some terrorists, and they are carrying the passports that were taken away by the Libyan Government. And you feel they could not have gotten those without the official support of the Libyan Government? I do not see any way that they could have, no. But there are other things even more potent than that. How soon will you be releasing- I do not know what the schedule is on that. Being released this afternoon by the State Department.

{"id": 332, "text": "UCSD, University of California-San Diego, was the one you named today from this area? That is right. They have a project that will use composite materials that were part of the Stealth aircraft development to build and repair bridges. There are others; let me just tell you where the others are in southern California. We have one in Redondo Beach that Cal State-Fullerton was involved in; one at Newport Beach with Hughes Electric, G.M. Hughes; one in Torrance-two in Torrance. So if you want to mention any of them, we can. Joining us now to talk about what is called the first wave of the Technology Reinvestment Program grant is the author of the plan, more or less, president of the United States, ENTITY. Thanks for joining us today to talk about what we here in San Diego call the defense conversion. Can you give us kind of a short definition or explanation of what it is you want to accomplish here? Yes, we are trying to take the capacities, the skills, the technologies that were developed in the big defense build-up of the 1980's, and instead of just letting those technologies and the abilities of those people go to waste, we want to give them a chance to be used in the commercial sector in a way that helps both national defense by keeping that skill and that technology alive and helps to rebuild the domestic economy and to create jobs. Today we announced the first of what will be four announcements between now and the end of November in the technology research project, which involved 41 projects from California to Maine from former defense contractors or current defense contractors using technologies in defense for domestic purposes. In San Diego, the University of San Diego and Muller International and a company called Trans-Science Corporation are using the composite materials developed for the Stealth aircraft to build and repair bridges. And they are working on a bridge in San Diego now. And this is just one of, as I said, over 40 projects. California got a large number of these projects but so did several other States that have been hurt by base closing and defense cutbacks. They were all given out on the merits, I assure you, and now what the companies have to do is to negotiate with our defense conversion projects to make sure that the Government and the companies all put up a fair amount of money. Then they will start hiring people and going to work. We are very excited about it. ENTITY, some claim that if it was a good idea, a strong company would run with that idea. Do you run a risk of propping up a bad company or a bad idea? There may be some risk of that, but it is not much of a risk. After all, in terms of the potential expenditure of money, this is mostly seed money to get these projects started. A lot of these companies are quite well established, and these technologies have proven merit in the defense area. This is the sort of thing that our competitors in Germany, Japan, countries with lower unemployment rates and higher investment rates than we do, they do these things all the time. We know the technology, the skills, the ideas to make the conversion, but we are not organized for it. This simply helps us to organize to make this conversion from a defense-based to a domestic economy. It will create a lot of jobs. And I think that it will be among the most efficient Government programs ever seen because, keep in mind, we do not put up all the money; if the other side does not put up half the money, the project does not get done. So, that is a pretty strong incentive to make sure whatever is done is a good project. ENTITY, UCSD's $21 million-granted, nobody wants to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is really a drop in the bucket when you consider what San Diego has lost so far in cutbacks in the military and defense jobs. It is, but that is the point. It starts up a new business enterprise for which there must be a market in the private sector. We believe there is a huge market. That is why all these things are helping to start up a process. Keep in mind, too, that San Diego gained 5,200 jobs in the last round of base closings and consolidations, so those new jobs will be coming into your area over the next couple of years, and that will help some also.

{"id": 224, "text": "ENTITY, you are about to fly to Kenya, to your ancestral home. Given the al-Shabaab attacks on the West Gate mall and Garissa University, I am sure your secret service could've suggested other countries for you to visit. But you wanted to go to Kenya. Well, I think it is important first of all that the president of the United States underscores our commitment to partnering with countries around the world, even though we are not intimidated by terrorist organisations. Second, the counterterrorism co-operation between the United States and Kenya - and Uganda and other countries - in East Africa - is very strong. At a time when we saw some possibility of transition, by the time I landed in Burma - it is not a liberal democracy by any means. And there were still significant human rights violations taking place. But my visit then solidified and validated the work of dissenters and human rights activists. And that has continued to allow them to move in the direction of a democracy. So, so our view is, in the same way that I visited Russia, and in the same way that I visited China, even when we know that there are significant human rights violations taking place, we want to make sure that we are there so that we can have this conversation and point them in a better direction. Well, have not the Chinese got there first in Africa? You are going to go to the African Union Building, which was built with Chinese money, you are going to travel along Chinese-built roads, you are going to go past endless Chinese traders on those roads. Well, the - what is true is that China has - over the last several years, because of the surplus that they have accumulated in global trade and the fact that they are not accountable to their constituencies, have been able to funnel an awful lot of money into Africa, basically in exchange for raw materials that are being extracted from Africa. And what is certainly true is that the United States has to have a presence to promote the values that we care about. We welcome Chinese aid into Africa. I think we think that is a good thing. We do not want to discourage it. As I have said before, what I also want to make sure though is that trade is benefiting the ordinary Kenyan and the ordinary Ethiopian and the ordinary Guinean and not just a few elites. And the Chinese, who then get the resources that they need. And I think that we can help to shape an agenda where China, Europe, and the United States are all working together in order to address some of these issues. I am going to suggest there may be one other difficult issue when you are there. And that is the issue of homosexuality, gay marriage, after the Supreme Court ruling. I mean, the deputy president in Kenya, who you are going to meet, Mr Ruto, he said - We have heard that in the US they have allowed gay relations and other dirty things. Yeah. Well, I disagree with him on that, do not I? And I have had this experience before when we have visited Senegal in my last trip to Africa. I think that ENTITY there President Sall, is doing a wonderful job in moving the country forward - a strong democrat. But in a press conference, I was very blunt about my belief that everybody deserves fair treatment, equal treatment in the eyes of the law and the state. And that includes gays, lesbians, transgender persons. I am not a fan of discrimination and bullying of anybody on the basis of race, on the basis of religion, on the basis of sexual orientation or gender. And I think that this is actually part and parcel of the agenda that is also going to be front and centre, and that is how are we treating women and girls. And as somebody who has family in Kenya and knows the history of how the country so often is held back because women and girls are not treated fairly, I think those same values apply when it comes to different sexual orientations. Can we just move from difficult conversations that you are about to have in Kenya and the excruciatingly difficult conversations that you had in getting the Iran nuclear deal? I am sure some people would say that yes, you have set out the case where there is no pathway to a nuclear bomb now for Iran - Yes. But, the net effect of lifting sanctions is that billions more will go to groups like Hezbollah, the Assad regime, and that is going to destabilise the region even more. Well, keep in mind, first of all, we have shut off the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon, which was priority number one. Because if Iran obtained a nuclear weapon, then they could cause all those same problems that you just listed with the protection of a nuclear bomb. And create much greater strategic challenges for the United States, for Israel, for our Gulf allies, for our European allies. Second, it is true that by definition, in a negotiation and a deal like this, Iran gets something out of it. The sanctions regime that we put in place with the hope of the Brits, but also the Chinese and the Russians and others meant that they had funds that were frozen. They get those funds back. A large portion of those funds are going to have to be used for them to rebuild their economy. That was the mandate that elected Rouhani. And the supreme leader is feeling pressure there. Does the IRGC or the Quds Force have more resources? Probably, as the economy in Iran improves. But the challenge that we have had, when it comes to Hezbollah, for example, aiming rockets into Israel is not a shortage of resources. Iran has shown itself to be willing, even in the midst of real hardship, to fund what they consider to be strategy priorities. The challenge is us making sure that we have got the interdiction capacity, the intelligence, that we are building a much stronger defence against some of these proxy wars and asymmetric efforts. And we have sent a clear message to the Iranians. We are settling the Iran deal, but we still have a big account that we are going to have to work. Hopefully some of it diplomatically, if necessary some of it militarily. And you have had an intense campaign to settle the argument, which you have set out with great confidence. Yes. Have you managed to change anyone's mind yet of the Gulf states or in Congress? Well, in Congress I am confident that we are going to be able to make sure that the deal sticks. With respect to the Gulf states we had the leaders up to Camp David. And I described for them our interest in making sure that they built their capacity to defend themselves and their territory and to make sure that destabilising activities that Iran may be engaging in are checked. But keep in mind, our Gulf partners, for example, their combined defense budget is ten times Iran's defense budget. But have they got the willingness to fight in the - Well, and - and - and that is the issue. And that is the challenge as - so the point that I made to them consistently is, you have a strong, reliable partner in the United States. But ultimately, how issues get resolved in the Middle East is going to depend on both strengthening military capacity, but also addressing the underlying social and political issues that may lead not only to Iran being able to stir up problems among Shia populations, but also addressing some of the issues that are leading to the enormous and significant threat that they face from ISIL. Nowhere is facing greater instability, and you mention ISIL, than in Syria. It looks like the British may be about to start flying alongside America and launching airstrikes. Would you welcome that? Let me first of all say that Prime Minister David Cameron's been an outstanding partner of ours on not just the anti-ISIL coalition, but on a whole host of security issues. And I want to congratulate his government for meeting the commitment of the 2% defence budget. Because we do not have a more important partner than Great Britain. And for him to make that commitment, when he has a budget agenda that is, you know confined, a budget envelope that is confined, is really significant. And it is important for British leadership, but it is important for US stability. Now, with respect to Syria, we consult closely, Britain's one of the leading members of the 60-nation coalition that is addressing ISIL. In combination with the Turks and the Jordanians and others, what we are trying to do is not only shrink the environment in which ISIL can operate, but also to create an environment in which we stop the border flows of foreign fighters into Syria, we have made progress there, we need to make more, and that is where Great Britain's participation can help. But the second part of this is pushing Assad, the Russians, the Iranians, into recognising there is got to be a political transition before Syria pulls the entire region into what could be an even longer and more bloody conflict. You talk about the 2% defence spending in Britain. I am right in thinking that there was quite a bit of pressure put on from here, saying it would be very bad if you did not . I would not say pressure. I think I had an honest conversation with David that Great Britain has always been our best partner. Well, you know, I guess you could go back to 1812 and that would you know, that - When we tried to burn this place down? Yeah, right, right. But that is ancient history - History. In modern times there is no country where we have closer affinity in terms of values, and on the international stage a nation with greater capacity. And so I think David understands that part of the greatness of Great Britain, of the United Kingdom is that it is willing, as we are, to project power beyond our immediate self-interests to make this a more orderly, safer world. And pe And we are glad we have that partner. And people have talked about strategic shrinkage. That Britain is no longer playing its place on the world stage in the way that it used to. There is going to be a referendum on whether we stay in the European Union or not. And David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, he said, It is almost like Britain would be resigning from the world and no US government would be impressed by that. Well, I - you know, obviously the - the whole debate that is been taking place about the European Union, the eurozone, Greece that is a complicated piece of business. I will say this, that having the United Kingdom in the European Union gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the transatlantic union and is part of the cornerstone of institutions built after World War II that has made the world safer and more prosperous. And we want to make sure that United Kingdom continues to have that influence. Because we believe that the values that we share are the right ones, not just for ourselves, but for Europe as a whole and the world as a whole. Can we just talk about, because you mentioned a moment ago about that you are in the tail end of your presidency. After the midterm elections, I read every commentator say, Well, this administration is effectively over now. ENTITY is a dead man walking. And nothing is going to happen until 2016. Right. Except that you have kind of got this deal, you have got Cuba, diplomatic relations, healthcare reform embedded, major trade deal with Asia. It is not a question of journalist Climate change agenda with China. Okay, so it is not - I have got a pretty long list. Okay, so it is not a question that a journalist often asks, what is gone right? You know the - it is interesting - that one of my - every ENTITY, every leader has strengths and weaknesses. One of my strengths is I have a pretty even temperament. I do not get too high when it is high and I do not get too low when it is low. And what I found during the course of the presidency, and I suppose this is true in life, is that investments and work that you make back here sometimes take a little longer than the 24-hour news cycle to bear fruit. So some of this is just some serendipity and convergence of a lot of things that we had been working on for a very long time coming together. But some of it is I also believe a recognition that the kind of gridlock and obstruction that that Congress and the Republicans in Congress too often have engaged in is something that we just cannot afford at a time when the world is moving so fast and there are so many challenges. And the robust exertion of executive authority within the the lawful constraints that we operate under is something that we have been spending a lot of time thinking about. Let me just ask you this - finally, because- I am sure you would like it to be written that ENTITY turned Yes we can into - Yes we did. Yes we did. Yeah. But is there an issue that there are be going to be unfinished business? Perhaps most notably on race and on guns by the time you leave the White House? There will be. Look there was never a promise that race relations in America would be entirely resolved during my presidency or anybody's presidency. I mean, this has been a running thread - and - and fault line in American life and American politics since its founding. And so some of the most recent concerns around policing and mass incarcerations are legitimate and deserve intense attention. And I feel that we are moving the ball forward on those issues. What I will say is that - eight years - well, after eight years of my presidency, that children growing up during these eight years will have a different view of race relations in this country and what is possible. Black children, white children, Latino children. America is becoming more diverse, it is becoming more tolerant as a consequence there is more interactions between groups. There are going be tensions that arise. But if you look at my daughters' generation, they have an attitude about race that is entirely different than even my generation. And that is all for the good. You mentioned the issue of guns, that is an area where if you ask me where has been the one area where I feel that I have been most frustrated and most stymied it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense, gun-safety laws. Even in the face of repeated mass killings. And you know, if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it is less than 100. If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it is in the tens of thousands. And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing. But it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months. ENTITY, thank you very much. Thank you so much. I enjoyed it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjonsopelbbc", "title": "Interview with Jon Sopel of BBC", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jon-sopel-bbc", "publication_date": "24-07-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 276, "text": "thank you for being with us on our 25th anniversary week. ENTITY, congratulations on 25 wonderful years. Thank you. It is been a special honor. Unbelievable. And an honor to be here and be with you. Thank you. I know you are going down to the Gulf again. But there is a question that a lot of us are pondering. After this is over, what about hurricanes? What about oil raining down? Have we thought about what we are going to do when it is over? Well, this is an unprecedented oil spill. We have not seen like -- anything like this before. And that is why the minute that the rig blew up and then sank down to the bottom of the ocean, I called in my entire team. And I have to tell you, ENTITY, that the worst case scenario was even worse than what we are seeing now because-- This is worse than what you thought it would be? No, no, no. What I am saying is it could have-- Oh. -- been even worse. So we realized right away this was going to be a big event, a big problem and that we had to put everything we had into it. So right away, we started mobilizing our Coast Guard, making sure that we are putting pressure on BP to activate their response. Eventually we ended up sending our top scientists. We now have about 100 of the top scientists from around the world in our national labs -- to look over BP's shoulder in terms of figuring out how they are going to plug the well. And we also knew, though, that, ultimately, the only way to relieve the well safely is to drill what are called these relief wells. Now, BP and other oil companies traditionally just drill one. We said, drill two in case one of them does not work. But that takes some time. It takes about three months. In the meantime, they have been experimenting with a whole bunch of other ways that they can capture the oil. But we have had a big spill. And we know that it is going to be a long response, a long cleanup. And my commitment has always been -- for the last 40 some days, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to mitigate the damage, to help clean up, help recover, because this is an area that already got battered during hurricane season. And this is an area that is a concern not only for the economy of the Gulf, but also for an entire way of life. Have the scientists discussed, what about a hurricane? You know, Wolf, I did -- I had a Situation Room meeting about a week-and-a-half ago where we got the report that this could be a more severe than normal hurricane season. And I asked, well, how does a potential oil spill interact with a hurricane? And it turns out that -- and now these are all estimations and probabilities. It turns out that a big, powerful hurricane, ironically, is probably less damaging with respect to the oil spill because it just disperses everything and the oil breaks up and -- and degrades more quickly. It is those tropical storms and tides that would just wash stuff into the marshes that would really be an ecological disaster. But, look, we -- we have got a couple of tasks right now. Number one, BP has to shut down this well. Now, the only guarantee to shut it down is the relief well and that is going to take a couple of months. In the meantime, we hope that by cutting the riser and putting a cap on this thing, they can funnel up the oil and that will help. In the meantime, we have still got all these barrels of oil that are sloshing around in the Gulf. They move with the currents. We do not always know where they are. But what we can do is make sure that our response does not hold anything back, that we put everything we have got into Louisiana, which has been hardest hit so far; Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. Senator Nelson wants the Defense Department, he says, more fully involved -- more troops. Yes. You know, I think that there is a mistaken understanding. First of all, the Coast Guard is part of our armed services and they are responsible for the coordinating, along with the responsible party -- in this case, BP -- to make sure that recovery efforts are top notch. And what I have said to Thad Allen, who is the national incident coordinator and is somebody who has been dealing with oil spills for 39 years now, is whatever you need, you will get. So if he says troops, he will get troops? If he -- if he says that there is equipment that is helpful in dealing with this problem, he will get it. But keep in mind that all this stuff has to be coordinated. Right now we have got over 20,000 people who are working there. We have authorized the activation of 17,000 National Guardsmen. We have got 1,700 vessels already in the water. And, you know, what you do not want is a situation where everybody is stepping on each other and not doing the best possible job, in coordination with the state and local levels. What part of it is your baby? What part of it is the country and not BP? Well, BP caused this spill. We do not yet know exactly what happened. But whether it is a combination of human error, them cutting corners on safety or a whole other variety of variables, they are responsible. So they have got to pick up the -- the tab for the cleanup, the damages, fishermen who are unable to fish right in the middle of their most important season. And my job is to make sure that they are being held accountable, that we get to the bottom of how this happened, that they are paying what they are supposed to be paying, that they cap this well. In terms of actually solving the problem, BP has particular expertise when it comes to capping the well. They have got the equipment that -- that our Defense Department -- the first thing I asked was, do we have some equipment that they do not have? And they, along with other oil companies, have the best equipment and have the best technology to deal with the well at the bottom of the ocean. What we have a responsibility for is to make sure that the recovery efforts, the mitigation efforts along the coastline, making sure that fishermen and businesses that are being affected are getting paid properly, making sure that local people are being hired -- all those efforts are ones where we can do it better. And so what we have said is, you are going to pay. You will coordinate -- BP -- with us. But ultimately, if we say that you need to deploy folks over there or you need to compensate such and such here or you need to, for example, most recently, help to dredge up and create some barrier islands in some selective areas of Louisiana in accordance with some of the ideas that the state had down there, then you need to do it. Some -- I know you -- you appear so calm. Are you angry at BP? You know, I am furious at this entire situation, because this is an example of where somebody did not think through the consequences of their actions. And it is imperiling not just a handful of people, this is imperiling an entire way of life and an entire region for, potentially, years. So -- Has the company felt your anger? Well, they have felt the anger. But what I have not seen as much as I'd like is the kind of rapid response. Now, they want to solve the problem, too, because this is costing them a lot of money. And the one thing that I think is important to underscore is that I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people. But that is not the job I was hired to do. My job is to solve this problem. And, ultimately, this is not about me and how angry I am. Ultimately, this is about the people down in the Gulf who are being impacted and what am I doing to make sure that they are able to salvage their way of life? And that is going to be the main focus that I have got in the weeks and months ahead. Governor Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, he is asked you to -- he is got concerns about the impact of stopping -- of the moratorium you have on drilling. And now that is been extended to -- to the shallow waters, as well. What would you say to him? Well, actually, the moratorium has not extended to the shallow waters. It is only-- Oh, that is wrong? It is only the -- it is only the deep water wells that we have placed a moratorium. Look, we have just seen an environmental disaster that is come about because these oil companies said they had a plan to deal with the worst case scenario and, obviously, it was not a very good plan because it is not working, ENTITY. And nobody is being impacted more than the citizens of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal's state. So I have said in the past that we need to transition to a more clean energy future. But we are not going to do that overnight. We have got to have domestic oil production. And I am supportive of offshore drilling if it can be done safely and it does not result in these kinds of horrible environmental disasters. And the problem I have got is until I have got a review that tells me, A, what happened; B, how do you prevent a blowout of the sort that we saw; C, if, even if it is a one in a million chance something like this happens again, that we actually know how to deal with it. Until that happens, it would be irresponsible of me to lift that moratorium. A couple of other things. Former President Carter has condemned the Israeli raid against those ships in the -- the flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza. Where do you stand on that? A former American president has condemned it. Well, you know, the United States, with the other members of the U.N. Security Council, said very clearly that we condemned all the acts that led up to this violence. It was a tragic situation. You have got loss of life that was unnecessary. And so we are calling for an effective investigation of everything that happened. And I think that the Israelis are going to agree to that -- an investigation of international standards -- because they recognize that this cannot be good for Israel's long-term security. Here is what we have got. You have got a situation in which Israel has legitimate security concerns when they have got missiles raining down on cities along the Israel/Gaza border. I have been to those towns and seen the holes that were made by missiles coming through people's bedrooms. So Israel has a legitimate concern there. On the other hand, you have got a blockade up that is preventing people in Palestinian Gaza from having job opportunities and being able to create businesses and engage in trade and have opportunity for the future. I think what is important right now is, is that we break out of the current impasse, use this tragedy as an opportunity so that we figure out how can we meet Israel's security concerns, but at the same time start opening up opportunity for Palestinians, work with all parties concerned -- the Palestinian Authority, the Israelis, the Egyptians and others -- and -- and I think Turkey can have a positive voice in this whole process once we have worked through this tragedy -- and bring everybody together to figure out how can we get a two-state solution, where Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace and security. It is premature, then, to condemn Israel? Well, I think that we need to know what all the facts are. But it is not premature to say to the Israelis and to say to the Palestinians and to say to all the parties in the region that the status quo is unsustainable. We have been trying to do this piecemeal for decades now and it just does not work. You have got to have a situation in which the Palestinians have real opportunity and Israel's neighbors recognize Israel's legitimate security concerns and are committed to peace. You met with the Arizona governor today. Will the administration bring a legal challenge to that law? You know, I am not going to comment on that, ENTITY, because that is really the job of the Justice Department. And, you know, I made a commitment early on that I would not be putting my hand -- thumb on the scales when these kinds of decisions are made. I have expressed a personal opinion, which is that although I understand the frustration of the people of Arizona when it comes to the inflow of illegal immigrants, I do not think this is the right way to do it. I think this puts American citizens who look Hispanic, are Hispanic, potentially in a unfair situation and-- But you are not going to And, more importantly, it also creates the prospects of 50 different laws in 50 different states when it comes to immigration. This is a federal job. What we have to do is take on that federal responsibility by working with border states on border security. And I told Governor Brewer that we have already put more resources into border security than we ever have. We have got more border guards in Arizona than we ever had. We have got -- we just made decisions to put in additional National Guard. But without comprehensive immigration reform, that is Congress' responsibility, we are not going to solve this problem and that is what we have to do. A couple of other quick things, because I know we have a little bit of a time limit. First, do you still like this job? Well, this is the best job on earth. I mean it is a -- it is an extraordinary privilege to be able to wake up every day and know that you have the opportunity to serve the American people and -- and make their lives a little bit better or maybe it is the next generation's lives a little bit better. And-- No matter what a polls say? You know what, the truth of the matter is, is that given everything we have gone through, my poll numbers are doing all right. It is 48 percent. Is that all right? You know, the -- we have gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression. We have got two wars going on right now. We have had multiple crises that have cropped up and people still have not fully recovered in terms of their job losses, in terms of what is happening in housing. So, you know, people, I think, understandably, are frustrated. But what they are starting to see is that the economy is getting better. We had the biggest job growth in years last month and I think we will have decent job growth this month-- Tomorrow it will come out. Tomorrow we will get an announcement. Businesses are starting to invest again. Manufacturing is stronger than it is been. The investments that we made early on -- some of which were controversial -- are paying off. If you look at, just to give you one example, the auto industry. I mean, GM is now turning a profit and hiring again. And the banks, as frustrating as, you know, the situation of having to bail them out was, they are repaying that money. And so a lot of the decisions that are being made are starting to pan out. But we are not out of the woods yet. People are still hurting. And, you know, it is a great privilege for me to have the most interesting job in the world and one where, every once in a while, I will get a letter from somebody -- you know, I -- I was traveling through Iowa. A woman comes up to me and says, you know what, that healthcare bill you passed, I am a small business woman, I am going to take advantage of that credit this year. This is going to help me and I might be able to hire somebody else because you just gave me the chance to get decent healthcare. And one other thing. LeBron James is with us tomorrow night. We pre-interviewed him. And he says, all things being equal, he is probably leaning toward Cleveland. That is where he grew up, in Akron. But he grew up a Bulls fan. You want him to go to Chicago, right? No, no, no. I-- What did you say? I want to be clear. What I -- what I said to-- Clear it up. First of all, LeBron, I have had a chance to meet him -- a wonderful young man, an amazing talent. What I said to him was -- I did not say it to him, I said it to Marv Albert. He needs to be in a place where he is got a coach and a team around him that can do what Phil Jackson and the Bulls did for Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan could not win a championship on his own. It is all about having a team concept that works. And he has not quite gotten that yet and he needs to find that situation. I will be honest with you -- and my folks in Chicago may be mad at me for saying this, but I think it would be a wonderful story if LeBron says, you know what, I am going to stay here in Cleveland. You know, he is from Ohio. You know, that -- that is a town that has had some tough times. For him to say-- Wow! -- I am going to make a commitment to this city, you know, I think would be a wonderful thing. But he is got to make sure that he is got a team around him and a coach that he respects, he is bought into a team concept, he is willing to be coached. And -- and if he does that, he will have an even more remarkable career than he is having right now. I saw you singing to Michelle last night with -- with Paul McCartney. That was a pretty nice kick, huh? Let me tell you, the -- I think that was one of the highlights that Michelle's had, is when Paul McCartney sings Michelle. To her, you know -- when she was a little girl growing up on the south side of Chicago, I suspect she did not think that was ever going to happen. Thank you, ENTITY. Thank you, ENTITY. Appreciate you. Thanks for celebrating with us. Congratulations again.

{"id": 334, "text": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to the White House. My name is ENTITY, and I am ENTITY of news and politics at YouTube. And we are delighted that ENTITY has once again invited us to the White House to answer your top-voted questions in the first exclusive interview after the State of the Union speech. Welcome back to YouTube, ENTITY. It is great to be here, ENTITY. Thank you so much for doing this. Well, I should tell you, ENTITY, that over 140,000 questions were submitted on YouTube over the past few days, over a million votes cast. You see some of these videos here flying over the map of the U.S. And we are going to try to go to as many of these as we possibly can today, and let us just get right into it. Let us -- let us dive in. The first question is from America's heartland. I am ENTITY from Akron, Ohio. ENTITY, I just got out of the Marine Corps infantry after serving two tours in Afghanistan, and now I am unemployed. How are you going to help people like me? Well, this is a great question. As you know, we have over a million people who've now served either in Iraq or Afghanistan. All of them have done extraordinary work. And it is our moral obligation to make sure that we are serving them as well as they have served us. And so there are a couple of things that we are doing right away. Number one, the Department of Defense and the VA are working together to make sure that we have got a career counseling program available. The minute folks are getting out of the armed services, we are helping them to make sure that they know where to land, what kinds of skills are transferable to what industries. Mm-hmm. We are trying to gather up companies who are willing to hire folks who have come out of the military. And we are making a big push with employers to say: These folks have shown leadership, They have been trained. They have performed at high levels, in very difficult situations. They are going to be great assets to help rebuild the country. But beyond Department of Defense and to Veterans Affairs, I have given a presidential directive to every agency to make sure that they are looking to hire veterans, that job-training programs, social service programs, anything that we have got in any of the agencies -- Mm-hmm. -- housing, education, you name it -- that they are directed specially to making sure that these veterans are served. What about job creation overall? You know, Wayne from Artesia, California, asked -- you know, he is a -- he is a recent college graduate. He says: How are you going to help recent college graduates like myself when there are fewer highly competitive points of entry? We have done everything by the book with little success, and we find ourselves in huge debt. All right. Well, a couple of points here. First of all, the reason they are in huge debt is because the cost of their college educations are so high. Mm-hmm. And that is why we have put such a big emphasis on eliminating unwarranted subsidies to banks, shifting billions of dollars into our student-loan programs. We have now made it so that young people, when they get out, should not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income to repaying their student debt, which alleviates a big burden on them. We were talking about veterans earlier. Obviously, the post-9/11 GI Bill is a huge asset for making sure our veterans and their spouses are able to get the training they need. But the overall jobs picture is still really tough out there. We created a million point -- a million-300,000 jobs last year in the private sector that we passed during the lame-duck session that is providing incentives to business to, you know, invest in business and equipment this year; making sure that there is a payroll-tax cut that can spur more consumer spending and economic growth. All those things are going to be absolutely critical. But, you know, obviously if you do not have a job right now, it is tough. And -- And -- and -- and we have got to make sure that we are focused exclusively on economic growth over these next 12 months. A lot of these job-creation programs cost money, and a lot of Americans are worried about the debt. Right. Let us go to Charles Wagster, who writes, ENTITY, you have all these plans to help the nation's businesses create new jobs. All these programs you plan on making will cost money. What cuts and what programs do you plan to cut in order to start reducing our debt? Well, as I announced at the State of the Union, what we are going to be doing is freezing domestic discretionary spending for the next five years. Now, keep in mind that a freeze actually ends up being a cut, because the population's going up, you end up having some slight inflation, and when you combine both increased population programs. And -- And what sorts of things -- what sorts of programs do you think are going to get cut? Well, you know, we are going to be announcing our budget, so I do not want to give too much details, because then nobody pays attention when we actually put the numbers out. But they are going to be programs like community action grants, for example, that really help cities and local communities to spur economic development, but you know, frankly we are just going to have to trim some of these programs. And these are not going to be across the board. We want to cut with a scalpel, as opposed to a chain saw. There are going to be some areas where we actually increase spending. Education is one. Research and development and innovation. We need to make sure that we are staying on the cutting edge of new technologies. But we are going to have to make some serious decisions. I can tell you that the budget is going to end up saving $400 billion or so. And it will mean that domestic discretionary spending goes down to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower, since -- lower -- lowest level -- the lowest level since I was born, certainly since you were born. Yeah. Well, you mentioned education as an area that would not get cut. Let us go to the category of education. This question comes from a charter school in. you said that many of the social and economic disparities that exist in the African-American community can be -- and I quote -- directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. How do you plan on addressing these social and economic disparities that currently exist in minority communities? In particular, what is your plan to close the pervasive achievement gap in education for American minorities today? Well, the first thing that we have got to remember -- and I said this at the State of the Union -- is that nothing government does replaces the importance of parents in education. And so all of us, regardless of our station, our race, where -- what region of the country we are coming from, if we are parents, we have got to step up our game in working with our kids to learn -- reading to them, turning off the TV, making sure they are doing their homework. You know, building a culture around the love of learning is critical. But our schools have a special role to play, obviously. And the single most important thing that we can do in closing the achievement gap is making sure that we have got good teachers in the classroom that are setting high expectations for our kids. And, you know, one of the challenges we have is a lot of times in poorer neighborhoods, higher minority student populations, oftentimes the teachers do not have as much experience in the subject matter that they are teaching. You know, in a lot of communities we need to provide more incentives for the best teachers to teach in the hardest-to-teach schools, as opposed to a lot of times their impulse, particularly if they have seniority, is to go to suburban schools or -- Yeah, of course. in wealthier communities, where the kids are better prepared. And that is understandable, but we have got to put a special focus on making sure that those schools that really need help are getting the best possible resources. One of the things we are doing with what is called Race to the Top, the program that Secretary Duncan and myself have been promoting, is we are saying to states, you get some additional money if you have got a real good game plan for those lowest-performing schools, and we do not want any child out there not having the best possible chance at succeeding. And one of the reasons it is so important to close the achievement gap is, the population is going to be increasingly Hispanic, increasingly African-American -- those are fast-growing populations -- increasingly Asian, and so if we are not doing a great job educating those kids and closing some of those achievement gaps, we are going to have problems as a country. Right. You mentioned Race to the Top. And a lot of people wrote in about Race to the Top -- Right. wondering what is going to happen this year. Political environment's a little bit different. Padma from Jericho, New York, wrote: ENTITY, where are you going to get the money to fund Race to the Top? And how do you expect schools with depleted resources to actually compete for this funding? Well, keep in mind, Race to the Top only costs 1 percent of what we spend overall on education. Right. That is the wonderful thing about the program is schools are still getting general support that is formula-based, meaning that each state, depending on its population and the number of children it has that are in low-income categories, are getting a certain amount of federal money. All we are saying is, let us carve out a little bit of this money and create a contest among states saying, if you have got the best plan to improve teacher quality, make sure that you are setting high performance, if you are setting up a way of tracking whether or not the kids are doing well -- if you do that, then we will give you a little bit of extra. And -- Is that contest going to have money this year to -- as Padma asked? It certainly will be in my budget. And I think that given we have had 40 states that have reformed their school systems just because of Race to the Top, and it is got widespread support from both Democrats and Republicans, I see no reason why we should not be able to get it done again this year. ENTITY, this is the Internet. And on the Internet, people love to have a more personal relationship with their elected officials. So let us move into sort of a YouTube rapid round. We will call it Get to Know Your ENTITY. All right. Let me flip through it here. There we go. These are some personal questions people submitted. First one -- maybe just one or two sentences on each if you can -- Sure. what is the best part about being ENTITY, and what is the worst part? Best part of being ENTITY is every once in a while, you do something that you know has a direct impact on somebody. So when we passed health care and I met a woman who was not going to lose her house because she was able to get her cancer treatments, and she comes up and says thank you; nothing's more satisfying than that. Toughest thing about being ENTITY is the bubble. I cannot go for a walk. I cannot go to the corner coffee shop. Right. Right. I cannot leave the house and not shave and, you know, have my sweats on. Right. ...like ENTITY. Right. Because -- so -- so that is something that I do not think I will ever get used to. Next question. ENTITY, what was your favorite class in college? Favorite class in college? I had a wonderful political science class. I still remember the name of the professor: Roger Boesche at Occidental College. Mm-hmm. And it sparked my general interest in politics. And he still teaches there and was just a wonderful, wonderful professor. Let us move to a critical question this week, over the next few weeks. ENTITY, who is winning the Super Bowl, Pittsburgh or Green Bay? This user, DCGARN, picks the Packers 31-28. I am sure you are still stinging from the loss the other night, but who do you pick to win? Now that the Bears have lost, I have got to stay neutral. Yeah. I already took a hard time from Charles Woodson. I do not know if you saw -- this is on YouTube -- is his speech after they won, where he says: ENTITY does not want to see us in Dallas, then we are going to see him in the White House! Then they all said: One, two, three, White House! Really? That was their call? I did not see. And then -- that -- and so I just came back from Wisconsin. First thing I get as I get off the plane is a signed Woodson jersey: See you in the White House. So -- no, Woodson's a great player and one of my favorite players in the NFL. So but -- But no picks? No picks. Okay. I -- I am going to -- I have to stay absolutely neutral on this one. And may the best team win. All righty. Next one. What are you getting Michelle for Valentine's Day? Well, I will tell you that the -- the more I am campaigning, the more I am ENTITY, each Valentine's Day seems to get more expensive. Oh, really. I have got more to make up for. Uh-huh. You know. Used to be I could just get away with flowers. Now -- So something expensive. Actually, the thing that she wants usually most of all is time. Yeah. So we always try to get a date night out on Valentine's Day. Two more quick ones, and then we will go back to some issue questions. The next one is, most people know you for your sports teams and all that kind of stuff, but who is your favorite mathematician or scientist? You know, I will tell you that lately my favorite mathematicians and scientists are actually folks that are not very well known. I get a chance to meet them on a pretty regular basis through what is called PCAST. It is my -- ENTITY's council on science and technology, essentially. Okay. John Holdren, my chief science adviser, is the lead on it. But there -- there is a guy, for example, Eric Lander, out of Harvard, who is -- who is the chair, who is just a terrific mathematician, world-class mathematician, has done extraordinary work on genetics, helped on the Human Genome Project. But what I love about him is he is -- he can explain things in English. So people who are not as mathematically savvy as me can actually follow him. But what is also great is he has this wonderful passion for translating highly theoretical science into very practical terms: You know, how does this help us solve problems in energy? Right. How does this help us solve problems in -- when it comes to health care? How can we improve biotechnical research? So I -- one of the things I love about being president is actually having access to math and science. And part of what we are trying to do in this White House is to really ramp up the emphasis on math and science, especially among kids. That is why we had the first science fair in quite some time here at the White House. And we met some kids -- there was one young woman from Dallas, I think it was, who -- she was only a junior in high school and had won an international science contest creating a new cancer drug. She had taught herself chemistry between her freshman and sophomore years in high school because she was interested in it. Now you have got companies calling her up wanting to work with her. She has not graduated from high school yet. Wow. So there is some serious brain power out there. We just have to tap it. Let us get to the last quick question here. A lot of people want to know what your favorite YouTube video is. Do you have a favorite YouTube video? You know, I have to say that I do not have a favorite YouTube video. Usually what happens is Malia or Sasha will show me some YouTube video that they have -- that they have discovered, and -- So you watch it with your kids? I watch it with my kids. The main thing I use YouTube for, I have to confess, is highlights that I have not seen -- Sports stuff. Sports stuff. Okay. Well, let us play you a few YouTube videos, actually, that have come in from across the world, people actually documenting their experiences in relatively serious situations, in fact very serious situations. These are some clips just over the past year that citizens have taken from the scenes and protests documenting what is taking place. You can see Tunisia and Thailand. And of course most recently, ENTITY, over the past few days in Egypt, people have taken to the streets in Cairo and been filming their experiences. A lot of people wrote in -- see here from the streets in Cairo -- wondering your reaction to the events that are taking place there. Kam Hawi wrote in there, saying: Dear Regarding the current situation in the Middle East and Egypt over the past two days, what do you think of the Egyptian government blocking social networks and preventing people from expressing their opinions? Well, let me say first of all that, you know, Egypt's been an ally of ours on a lot of critical issues. They made peace with Israel. President Mubarak has been very helpful on a range of tough issues in the Middle East. But I have always said to him that making sure that they are moving forward on reform -- political reform, economic reform -- is absolutely critical to the long-term -- well being of Egypt. Mm-hmm. And you can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets. My main hope right now is, is that violence is not the answer in solving these problems in Egypt. So the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence, and the people on the streets have to be careful about not resorting to violence. And I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances. As I said in my State of the Union speech, there are certain core values that we believe in as Americans that we believe are universal: freedom of speech, freedom of expression, people being able to use social networking or any other mechanisms to communicate with each other and express their concerns. And that, I think, is no less true in the Arab world than it is here in the United States. Let us stay in the Middle East for a second, go from Egypt to Afghanistan. I am going to play you two questions back to back about the way forward in Afghanistan. Mm-hmm. I am from Brunswick, Ohio. And ENTITY, I have a friend in the military, and I was just wondering whether you are -- if you really feel that it is still important for our young men and women to be dying over in Iraq and Afghanistan. And just one more after this and then we will -- I am sorry, I actually need to push the button. Here we go. ENTITY, disrupting, dismantling and defeating al-Qaida and preventing its capacity to threaten the United States and our allies in the future is how you have defined our objective in Afghanistan. How do preventative wars costing the lives of innocent civilians in countries that have not attacked us distance your foreign policy from the Bush Doctrine or disprove the assertion of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s that the United States is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world? Well, Dennis's question, I am not sure I buy into the premise. Our work in Afghanistan is precisely because that is -- was the launching pad from which 9/11 happened and 3,000 Americans were killed. So we are not over there by accident. Obviously, I disagreed with us going into Iraq, but I will say that we are bringing the war in Iraq to a honorable conclusion because of the extraordinary service of our men and women, both military and civilian in Iraq. We have still got work to do in this transition, but by the end of this year, we will have all our troops out. And the Iraq -- the Iraqi people now have a government that they will be looking to for governance and development. In Afghanistan, we have al-Qaida and its allies. We have them along the border region in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and it is my job as president to make sure that they cannot launch another 9/11 against us. Over the next couple of years, we are going to be transitioning so that we are bringing troops back. Afghans are taking a greater lead. The situation's not going to be perfect there, but what we have been able to do is to continually shrink the ability of al-Qaida to launch operations. And we expect to dismantle their operational capacity over the next several years. And that is our goal, and we are going to keep on it. And maybe just real briefly, to Sheila, the mother of the soldier who wants to know -- Well, as I have said, we will be out of Afghanistan by the end of this year. I mean, we will have a relationship with Iraq the same way we have relationships with many countries around the world, but -- So out of Afghanistan is in -- But combat operations in Afghanistan have ended. And under the Strategic Framework Agreement that we signed with Iraq, we are not going to be having large contingents of troops there. Afghanistan is a tougher situation, but what I have said is -- is that starting in July of this year, we are going to begin to phase down our troop levels. And we have agreed with our allies that by 2014 this is going to be an Afghan effort. Let us move to energy. You just got back from Wisconsin yesterday -- Yeah. -- where you were looking at some solar and wind plants. Here is Alexis from Florida. Dear ENTITY, in 2009 you said that you would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and -- renewable energy efforts. Well, since 1974, the seven presidents before you said the exact same thing, and yet still, here we are. So what will you do different in order to remove us from foreign oil and put us on the path towards renewable and clean green energy? This is why we have made such a big emphasis on this in my State of the Union speech, and I talked about it yesterday as I said, part of it is just creating a market. In every new technology, initially it is very expensive -- Right. -- because it is new and not enough people are buying it. And if you have to make it one at a time, then it is expensive. But if you start being able to make a hundred thousand of them or 200,000 of them, then the unit costs of each one go down. The same is true with clean energy. So what we have got to do is make sure that there is a market for entrepreneurs out there. And that is why something like a clean-energy standard is so important. You know, it was not one of our official categories, I will be honest with you, but we got a lot of questions on drug policy. And maybe even -- I think we did last year too. You know, there are a lot of folks online who want to know your thoughts on it. And I think with Prop 19 in California last fall, it is even more on people's minds. Right. Here is the top-voted question in that area. Good evening, ENTITY. My name is ENTITY. I am a retired law enforcement ENTITY and ENTITY of LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. The so-called war on drugs has been waged for 40 years at a cost of a trillion dollars and thousands of lives, with nothing to show for it but increased supplies, cheaper drugs and a dramatic increase in violence associated with the underworld drug market. Sir, do you think there will or should come a time for us to discuss the possibility of legalization, regulation and control of all drugs, thereby doing away with the violent criminal market as well as a major source of funding for international terrorism? Thank you so much for your time, ENTITY. Well, I think this is an -- a entirely legitimate topic for debate. I am not in favor of legalization. I am a strong believer that we have to think more about drugs as a public health problem. When you think about other damaging activities in our society -- smoking, drunk driving, making sure you are wearing seatbelts -- you know, typically we have made huge strides over the last 20, 30 years by changing people's attitudes. And on drugs, I think that a lot of times we have been so focused on arrests, incarceration, interdiction that we do not spend as much time thinking about how do we shrink demand. And this is something that, you know, within the White House we are, you know, looking at very carefully. As I said -- And that is? Well, the -- some of this requires shifting resources, being strategic; where does it make sense for us to really focus on interdiction? We have to go after drug cartels that not only are selling drugs but also creating havoc, for example, along the U.S.-Mexican border. But are there ways that we can also shrink demand? You know, in some cities, for example, it may take six months for you to get into a drug treatment program. Right. Well, if you are trying to kick a habit and somebody says to you, well, come back in six months, that is pretty discouraging. And so we have got to do more in figuring out how can we get some resources on that end of it and make sure that -- and also look at what we are doing when we have nonviolent first-time drug offenders; are there ways that we can make sure that we are steering them into the straight and narrow without automatically resorting to incarceration, drug courts, mechanisms like that? So these are all issues that are worth exploring and worth of a -- worth a serious debate. I want to get a health care question in here. The number-one-voted health care question came from Noah, who asks: I have diabetes, and so my medicine is very expensive. Why does the same medication that I use cost so much less in Mexico or Canada, even though it is being made right here in the United States? We as a country need to fix this problem. Well, the main reason is, is that Canada, Mexico, their governments are both purchasers of these drugs, and so they negotiate much cheaper prices with the drug companies. We still do not do that. And I actually think it is something we should do. It would save us money. Now, the -- the drug companies, as part of health care reform last year, did agree to essentially put in more money for prescription drugs for seniors, make them cheaper. But they are probably not as cheap as they should be or could be. That was the subject of compromise through the legislative process. I think we could go further. So nothing in the health care plan will fix -- right now will fix this problem -- Well, actually, if -- depending on Noah's circumstances, if he is getting prescription drugs through the Medicare program, then our laws -- what we are doing is we are closing the doughnut hole, which is that portion of the law that said, at a certain point, you start paying full price for your drugs. So we are making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors, and we are going to be phasing out that doughnut hole over the next several years. So Noah may be helped if he is getting these drugs through Medicare. If he is getting them through a private insurer, then we have still got to do more work in the private health care plans to figure out how we can cheapen drugs, and it may be that importation is -- is still something that we -- we should look at in terms of further lowering the price of drugs. Another top-voted healthcare question had to do with something that I know your wife is very passionate about, and it is from ENTITY. My name is ENTITY. I live in Brooklyn, New York. Right now, we live in a country where it is cheaper to feed our kids Froot Loops than it is to feed them fruit. I'd like to know, what are you going to do to reverse that? Well, the -- you know, the main thing I have done is I -- I have the first lady, who is just driving this -- this issue in an incredible way all across the country. I do not know if you have read recently, for example, that she was able to negotiate something with Wal-Mart where, for the first time, they are going to start putting labels on their products -- Mm-hmm. Yeah. -- and also emphasize more healthy choices for their customers. What about cost, though? I think -- Well, what happens is, when Wal-Mart ends up saying, we are going to buy healthier stuff, then suddenly all the producers say, you know what, we better start producing healthier stuff. And that can make it cheaper. The other thing that we are doing -- for example, Josh there was just eating an apple -- one of the things that we are trying to do is to encourage linkages between local supermarkets, local farmers, local producers to figure out how can we get fresh produce in communities that right now do not have access to press -- fresh produce. That is good for the farmer. It is good for retail stores in underserved communities. And ultimately, it is good for the consumer. The child nutrition bill that we just passed is similarly working with schools to figure out how can we make sure that you are not just serving tater tots and pizza all day long. Right. You know, are you able to get fresh fruits and vegetables into the school lunch program? So all these things are geared towards making local produce, fresh produce, much more available and cheaper to every family and not just families who can afford to go into high-end supermarkets. Right. The last issue category we have not gotten to yet is immigration. And I want to show you this question. The audio is good. The video is a little janky, but I think you should be able to hear what ENTITY is saying right here. ENTITY, my name is ENTITY, and I am a DREAM Act ENTITY currently studying to become a nurse at City College of San Francisco. Last year, my house was raided by ICE, and I was incarcerated for two months in a detention center in Arizona, awaiting my deportation to Peru. I was able return to my friends and family when Senator Feinstein agreed to introduce bill to stop my deportation to Peru. The Senate has failed to pass the DREAM Act because of partisan politics. ENTITY, will you help us make sure that there is a moratorium to stop the deportation of innocent students who qualify for the DREAM Act? Thank you. Well, you know, Steve's an example of what I talked about at the State of the Union address. We have got incredibly talented young people who grow up as Americans, pledge allegiance to our flag and are now at risk of deportation not because of anything they did but because their parents brought them here as young children and they did not have their legal papers. And so I am a strong supporter of the DREAM Act. The reason I spoke about it during the State of the Union is because I think we should still be able to get Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve this problem. I want somebody like Steve to study to be a nurse and be able to contribute to our society. Are you hopeful this year that the DREAM Act can get passed or something like it? I am hopeful that we should be able to get this thing passed, in part because in previous years we have had Republican and Democratic support for it. And this is one more problem that we can solve if we are not trying to score political points off each other but we are just looking at, you know, how do we create an environment where this is a country of laws and a country of immigrants. And we can reconcile those two values, but we are going to have to do it together. Let us move to our last question. This comes from ENTITY in Syracuse, New York. ENTITY, after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the young people in the nation were challenged with learning maths and sciences so that the country could compete. What does America need from my generation to still be great when it is time to hand it to our kids? Well, I talked about winning the future. I think that is what every American wants to see. Obviously, we are concerned about the immediate problems of unemployment, coming out of the recession. But -- but what we also want to feel confident about is that 10 years from now, 15 years from now, 20 years from now, America is still at the top when it comes to technology, when it comes to innovation, when it comes to a dynamic economy. And I am absolutely convinced that we can do it. But in order to accomplish it, we are going to have to out-build, out-educate, out-innovate every other country. That is what we have always done. We are -- we are going to have a government that is trimming its deficits, living within its means. It is got to be updated for the 21st century. But the most important thing we have to do is to make sure that young people like Tom are getting the best education possible; that young engineers and scientists, they have the resources to -- to create new products and new technologies; that we have got an economy that is dynamic and rewards success, but also an economy that benefits from the best transportation systems, the best Internet systems, the best roads and bridges and airports. And -- and so, the -- the goal over the next couple of years is to make sure that, even as we are reducing our deficit, dealing with our debt, that we are still making some core investments that are going to prepare us for the future. And I guess the last point I'd make, though, is, is that, as important as government is, what is most important is that this generation of Americans feel that same sense of confidence about the future that previous generations have felt, and that we are willing to work for that future the same -- same way the previous generations worked for that future. You know, I want our kids to be understanding that to win the future, we are going to have to outwork folks. We are going to have to be disciplined. You know, math and science may not be subjects that come naturally to some kids, but you need to learn them if you want to succeed in this next century. You know, we need to reward engineers at least as much, if not more, than we are rewarding lawyers and investment bankers in this culture. So, you know, we are going to have to up our game as individuals. Government can help. And what I have tried to do is to say here is how we can make some investments in our future that will unleash what I know is the inherent capabilities of the American people to create and innovate that is unmatched by any other country on Earth. I am afraid we are out of time, ENTITY. Time often flies when you are watching YouTube videos. But really appreciate you taking the time to bring the American people in here to the White House. There is an open and vibrant discussion on the Internet about the future of the country. Absolutely. And for the chance for anybody across the country to just lean into a webcam or a video camera and have a chance for ENTITY of the United States to answer their question, it is just a -- it is a great symbol of how open and accessible government can be. So thanks for making it happen. ENTITY, I really enjoyed it. And I appreciate everybody who sent in their questions. They were all outstanding. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.

{"id": 350, "text": "The speech on Tuesday in Kansas sounded very much like a campaign speech. What were you trying to get across? Our economy is in a transition of the sort that America's gone through maybe every 70-75 years. We went from an agriculture economy to an information, to an industrial economy during Teddy Roosevelt's period. We have now gone from an industrial to a knowledge-based, innovation society. And, you know, there are a lot of disruptions. And the middle class in America has really taken it on the chin, during this period. They have not seen their wages go up, they have not seen their incomes go up. You know, women went into the workforce to try to keep family incomes up. But then that was not enough; they ended up getting into debt. And they are not seeing enough prospects for a future where their kids are gonna do better than they are. Now the good news is, we can solve these problems and meet these challenges, because America, by definition, is an innovation society. We constantly remake ourselves. So there is no reason why we should not succeed in this era, just like we have succeeded in past eras. But it requires us to make some adjustments. And it requires everybody to have a fair chance, everybody to do their fair share, and rules of the road that create fair play for everybody. And what people have been frustrated about, especially since the financial crisis, is the sense that the rules are rigged against middle-class families and those aspiring to get in the middle class. So, if we are willing to make investments in education so that everybody gets a fair chance and kids are not coming out with $100,000 worth of debt to go to college. If we make sure that everybody's doing their fair share, to pay for things like infrastructure improvements in basic science and research and advanced manufacturing and innovation, we ask those who've benefited the most over the last three decades, we ask them to do a little bit more. And if we have got tough rules of the road -- like the financial reform package that we passed into law last year -- there is no reason why over the next five, ten years, we cannot reposition ourselves so that every single American, no matter what they look like, no matter where they come from, they can succeed. And that is my goal as ENTITY. That is what I think about every day. And that is what led me to run for ENTITY in the first place. Since the midterm elections, you have made an effort at bipartisanship. It has not worked out that way. In Kansas, you did not mention it. And it seems to me, it appears, watching you the last month or so, that you have stopped reaching out to Republicans. That you are going on the offensive... and taking your message to the voters. Well, I think that when I came into office in 2008, it was my firm belief that at such an important moment in our history, there was no reason why Democrats and Republicans could not put some of the old ideological baggage aside and focus on common sense, what works, practical solutions to the tough problems we were facing. And I think the Republicans made a different calculation, which was, You know what? We really screwed up the economy. ENTITY seems popular. Our best bet is to stand on the sidelines, because we think the economy's gonna get worse, and at some point, just blame him. And so we have not gotten the kind of engagement from them that I would have liked. And the best example of this was when we were negotiating around reducing the deficit. The truth is that, compared to other countries around the world, our deficit problems are completely manageable. If we had a balanced package that reforms some of our health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, that cuts discretionary spending, which I have already agreed to do - and we have cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending so far, and I am willing to do more. And I have put forward specific plans to do more. And we ended up asking the wealthiest Americans to do a little bit more in terms of taxes. Going back to rates that would still be lower than they were under Ronald Reagan, our deficit problems would be solved. And I could not get Republicans to go ahead and say, You are right. We are gonna put country ahead of party. Now what I have said to them is, That deal remains on the table. My offer to cooperate on a whole range of issues remains on the table. But I cannot wait, because the American people cannot wait. They need help right now. And so what we have done, since this debt ceiling debacle, is to look at every single thing I can do through executive actions to go ahead and help provide some relief to middle-class families. So helping families to take advantage of low interest rates to refinance their homes, putting couple extra thousand dollars in their pockets, helping students so that their debt burden when they come out of school is lower. We are just gonna keep on looking for specific things that we can do without Congressional cooperation. But ENTITY, I would love nothing more than to have the Republicans say, We are gonna be focused on trying to solve problems and not score political points. And the best example is the debate we are having right now around the payroll tax cut extension. This is a deal that we cut last year that every economist says we need to help sustain the recovery. And traditionally, Republicans have tried to claim the mantle of being in favor of every tax cut. They never want to raise taxes. And yet, we have the prospect in 20-some days that 160 million Americans will see their taxes go up by an average of a thousand bucks. And yet, it is become a negotiation, where they think that in order for us to do something that is common sense and needed for our economy, that somehow they are doing me a favor. This is not something you do for me. We even had a Republican quoted in the newspapers yesterday, saying that If we load up a whole bunch of additional stuff that ENTITY does not like, then maybe we'd pass the payroll tax -- and the more ENTITY does not like it, the more I like it. That attitude just drives people crazy. But have you stopped reaching out? Have you given up on the Republicans? Have you stopped reaching out to them? Are you just out there now trying to get your message across? Every opportunity that I see for us to be able to actually get something done, I will seize. So we passed three trade agreements that the Republicans agreed to. And I lined up my party behind it, even though it was not popular in certain segments of my party. And that is a good example of any time we can see areas of potential cooperation, we want it desperately. Because my biggest incentive right now is to get this economy moving and put people back to work. And I will worry about the politics sometime next year. But right now, what I am worrying about are the letters that I am getting and the people I am talking to every single day, who are working hard, have been working hard for five years, ten years, 20 years, and do not feel like they are getting ahead. And I want to make sure that we are doing right by them. There are people that think that you took a very hard line. That the Republicans were not the only ones that were being intransient. That . . . That is based off . . . Let us take the issue of tax reform. It seems to be an issue everybody's interested in right now. Your own Simpson-Bowles Commission, recommended a balanced approach, and they recommended big reforms in the tax system. All for 'em. Cutting the basic rates, getting rid of deductions, and making the tax form simpler. The Republicans made a couple of overtures during those negotiations to raise revenues. And you did not ... No, ENTITY. ENTITY, that is just not the case. What happened was that they made overtures, where they were willing to raise about $200 billion in exchange for $2 trillion or so worth of cuts of core programs like Medicare that seniors depend on for their security in their golden years. And what I said to them was, A balanced approach means exactly what it says. It means it is balanced. I would love to see tax reform. And if we can get a commitment from the Republicans that they want to work on a serious tax reform package that makes sure that the wealthiest Americans are paying their fair share, that is simplifying the tax code, that is lowering rates, but by broadening the base, that is something I am all for. It is part of my plan. But what we have not seen is any serious movement on the other side. Let us take another example... Well, they say they are ready to do it. They say it is your insistence on raising the taxes to the wealthiest Americans, that you are fixated on that. And that there are other ways to raise revenue. ENTITY, the math is the math. You cannot lower rates and raise revenue, unless you are getting revenue from someplace else. Now, either it is coming from middle-class families or poor families or it is coming from folks like you and me that can afford to pay a little more. I mean, I think the average American understands that. The argument has been that if you reform the deduction process... The deductions mean home mortgages for middle-class families. The deductions mean things that a lot of people of modest means rely on. Now we can have a discussion about potentially reforming some of those deductions, but you cannot get away from the basic concept that either we have a system in which the people who have benefited the most from this new economy -- by a magnitude of 200%-300% increases in their income. Either they are doing a little bit more or they are not. I think they should. And this is not because I am interested in punishing the rich. I want everybody to be rich, that is great. It has to do with the fact that the less I am asking you or me to do, the more I am asking somebody who is in a much tougher position to sacrifice. And that is basic math. I want to be very clear here, ENTITY. Democrats have moved significantly on a whole range of issues, in part, because of my leadership. I went out there in August and I said, We should take on entitlement reform, despite the fact that there were a lot of people in my party who felt that, You know what, this is something we should preserve and we can beat Republicans over the head as trying to weaken Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. And I said, You know what? These are long-term programs that we need to fix. We need to make sure that they are sustainable for the future so that the next generation of seniors have them. But in order to do that, we have got to start reducing health care costs. And I took a lot of heat for it. We have not seen the equivalent willingness on the other side. And the bottom line is this: If there is a serious proposal out there that is balanced, I want to seize it. And I am ready tomorrow to sign a bill that is balanced. Look, you gave up a lot. You said you wanted a balanced approach. You did not get it. You cut a trillion dollars and set up the framework to cut another trillion plus and the Republicans gave up nothing. I mean, there are people in your own party who think that you were outmaneuvered. That you were stared down by John Boehner and Grover Norquist and capitulated. Right. ENTITY, you have got to get your story straight, though. The first argument was that I do not compromise at all. Now you are saying I gave up too much. It seems to be all the compromising is being done by you. Both stories cannot be true. Right? So I think what you will see is that we were willing to make some tough cuts on programs, some of which I like and would like to see in place. But we cannot afford them right now. So yes, we made some tough cuts. But that trillion dollars' worth of cuts were cuts that we had helped identify, that we were willing and prepared to make anyway. And we did so partly because we think it is important to send a strong signal that we are serious about deficit reduction. But also because, in order for us to free up resources to do the things that will help us win the future -- like making sure, for example, that students have an easier time financing college -- it means we have got to get rid of some programs that do not work. So, I have got no problem with that. What is going to really solve the deficit over the long term and not just the short term, we Democrats to agree to make some modifications on entitlements so that they are sustainable and stronger over the long term. And it requires Republicans to get off the dime when it comes to revenues. And to make sure that everybody's doing their fair share. And if we do that, we can solve this problem. We have a new CBS poll, which is out this weekend. And I will give you the news that is good for you first: People like you. They respect you. They think that you are working hard. And they realize that you faced an enormous amount of trouble and problems, many of them inherited. And your approval rating is four times higher than the Congress. That is a low bar, I gather. But they are not happy with the way you are doing your job. You have got 75% of the people in the country think it is headed in the wrong direction, 75%. And 54% do not think that you deserve to be reelected. I mean, those are not good numbers with 11 months to go before the election. Well look, we have gone through an incredibly difficult time in this country. And I would be surprised if the American people felt satisfied right now. They should not feel satisfied. We have got a lot more work to do in order to get this country and the economy moving in a way that benefits everybody, as opposed to just a few. And we did not get into these problems overnight. We are not gonna get out of them overnight. And as long as I am ENTITY, I am gonna be held responsible, in some fashion, to fix the problem. And, you know, that is why I do not spend a lot of time worrying about polls. I spend a lot of time worrying about, Are the steps that we are taking the right ones, in order to get a better result for ordinary families who are working hard? I think when it comes to election time, what the American people are gonna be asked is: Does the vision I am putting forward have a better chance of succeeding than the vision that the other side is putting forward? And it becomes a choice. And I am very confident that the choice is one that we can win. Because I think our ideas are better. And I say that not because of personal ambition, it is because I think that this country has to move in a direction that builds from the bottom up, an economy where everybody has a chance to succeed. And the only way we are gonna do that is to improve our education system, make investments in infrastructure, roads, bridges, broadband lines, basic research, increase the number of engineers we have got, number of scientists that we have, encourage entrepreneurship -- all the things that I have been talking about over the last several years. And what we are not gonna succeed in doing is somehow creating a you are -on-your-own economy, in which just a handful of people are succeeding and the expectation is somehow those benefits are gonna trickle down to everybody. It has not worked. It has not worked in the past, it is not gonna work in the future. You have talked a lot about the Republican intransigence. Is not it your job as ENTITY to find solutions to these problems, to get results, to figure out a way to get it done? It is my job to put forward a vision of the country that benefits the vast majority of Americans. It is my job to make sure that my party is behind those initiatives, even if sometimes it is breaking some china and going against some of the dogmas of our party in the past. We have done that on things like education reform. And it is my job to rally the American people around that vision. And on all three fronts, we have been able to do that. If I cannot get Republicans to move, partly because they have made a political, strategic decision that says, Anything ENTITY's for, we are against, because that is our best chance of winning an election, I do not think the American people would see that as a failure on my part. My preference is that they'd have a different attitude. You know, I have been joking with my staff lately that I think in my next speech, I am gonna say, I am adamantly opposed to investing in education and putting teachers in the classroom. I am adamantly opposed to rebuilding America and putting construction workers back to work. And I am thinking maybe suddenly Republicans might be for it. But, you know, keep in mind, I am talking about Republican members of Congress. I am not talking about Republicans around the country. They do not like you much better. It is only 7% approval rating. Yeah, no, I understand. But I think that they like the ideas that we put forward. I mean, the interesting thing is the majority of Republicans actually think we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, including tax increases for the wealthy. The majority of Republicans do think that we should make investments in roads and bridges and improving our airports and investing in basic research and medical research. So if you take my name out of it and just look at the ideas that we have been presenting, these are common sense, mainstream ideas that Republican presidents in the past have supported. And that, by the way, includes a health care plan that a certain Republican governor in the past has supported. Fifty-one percent do not like yours. Yeah. You say that you rallied the country, but these poll numbers show otherwise. They show that 75% thinks the country's on the wrong track. And it shows that actually 54% do not feel that you have the same priorities as they do. ENTITY, here is the thing. As long as the unemployment rate is too high and people are feeling under the gun -- day in, day out -- because their bills are going up and their wages and incomes are not , or they are out of a job, they are gonna feel unsatisfied. I mean, there is no secret to this. No question about it. And the fact of the matter is that if unemployment was at 5% right now, I suspect all those numbers would be pretty different. It is not. Well, and that is the point. So all I can worry about is making sure that every single day, the steps I am taking, I believe, are advancing an agenda that leads to America's success over the long term. And until you actually see results, people are gonna continue to be frustrated. If the results begin to come, then I think we will do very well. With the unemployment at 8.6 , you still got soft consumer demand. You have got no business investment, there is still a fairly steady downturn in housing prices. Do you know something that these 29% do not know? I mean, do you see some hope? Do you think that things are gonna get better? Do you think that you might have the unemployment rate down to 8% by the time the election rolls around? I think it is possible. But, you know, I am not in the job of prognosticating on the economy. I am in the job of putting in place the tools that allow the economy to thrive and Americans to succeed. And keep in mind that when I came into office, it turns out that in the three months before I was sworn in, the economy had contracted by 9%. Almost unprecedented, certainly since the 1930s. We lost four million jobs before I was sworn in and another four million jobs in three months after I was sworn in, but before any of our economic policies had a chance to take effect. Eight million jobs were gone. And things were cratering. Six months later, the economy was growing again. And we have now had nine consecutive quarters, two and a half years, in which the economy's grown. About nine months later, we were creating jobs again. And we have had 21 consecutive months of private sector job growth. So, does that make people feel better? No. You know, we did all the right things to prevent a great depression and to get the economy growing again and to get job creation going again. But it has not made up for the hole that was created in those six, nine, 12 months before my economic policies took effect. Now the second challenge, though, is a set of structural problems in the economy that date back ten years, 15 years -- where wages and incomes have not been going up -- that were papered over because the housing bubble was going on and people could borrow from their homes and use credit cards. And so they could keep up their standard of living, even though the underlying economy was going through profound changes and weakening. We have two challenges: Number one is recovering what was lost during the financial crisis. But the second problem is dealing with those long-term structural problems. That is gonna take some time. And, you know, sometimes when I am talking to my team, I describe us as, you know, I am the captain and they are the crew on a ship, going through really bad storms. And no matter how well we are steering the ship, if the boat's rocking back and forth and people are getting sick and, you know, they are being buffeted by the winds and the rain and, you know, at a certain point, if you are asking, Are you enjoying the ride right now? Folks are gonna say, No. And say, Do you think the captain's doing a good job? People are gonna say, You know what? A good captain would have had us in some smooth waters and sunny skies, at this point. And I do not control the weather. What I can control are the policies we are putting in place to make a difference in people's lives. I am not saying this as fact, and hindsight is always 20-20. But there is a general perception that the stimulus was not enough. That it really did not work. That... Let me stop you there, ENTITY. First of all, there is not general perception that the stimulus did not work. You have got John McCain's former economist and a whole series of prominent economists, who say that it created or saved three millions jobs and prevented us from going into a great depression. That works. So that is not true. It is true that some people have argued, given the magnitude of the crisis we were in, we should have done an even larger Recovery Act. And then I am bumping up against the realities of Congress, which is this Recovery Act was twice as large as most people thought was even possible. And yet, because the problem was so big, you can make an argument that it might have been larger. There are some people who argue, Well, you could have done a different mix. Well, a third of this was tax cuts to the American people, putting more money into their pockets. And I suspect the average American who was spending that money probably thought that was a pretty good use of Recovery Act dollars. A third of it was helping states make sure that we are not laying off teachers and firefighters and police officers. And by the way, as that money has run out, our biggest problem right now, in terms of job loss, is actually precisely those folks whose jobs we saved during the Recovery Act, now being laid off because states and local governments have seen the difficulties of managing their budgets in the face of these difficult economic times. So we made the right moves, even when they were politically difficult. Our intervention in the auto industry probably saved about a million jobs. And, by the way, taxpayers have been paid back a big chunk of the money, much faster than anybody anticipated. And we are now competing with other automakers from other countries in ways that we had not seen before. But it is not enough. And the recurring challenge here, ENTITY, is always gonna be, even if we have done the right things, if people's reality right now is still difficult, they are gonna be frustrated. And they should, because I am frustrated. The question in the election... And they hold you equally accountable with the Congress. And the question next year is gonna be -- and this is how democracy's supposed to work -- do they see a more compelling vision coming out from the other side? Do they think that cutting taxes further, including on the wealthy, cutting taxes on corporations, gutting regulations. Do we think that that is gonna be somehow more successful? Rolling back Wall Street reform? You know, rolling back clean air and clean water laws? And if the American people think that that is a recipe for success and a majority are persuaded by that, then I am gonna lose. But I do not think that is where the American people are gonna go, because I do not think the American people believe that, based on what they have seen before, that is gonna work. I mean, nobody, if you look at the poll numbers, nobody's particularly happy with you. Certainly not the Republicans, not the Democrats, either. I mean, you have got like 19% do not think that you deserve to be reelected. But the biggest problem seems to be with the independents, who played such a big role in your last election. Right now, you have only got 37% believing that you deserve to be reelected. And 55% of the independents do not think you deserve to be reelected. How can you change that? How do you explain it? You think this is just the economy? Absolutely, it is just the economy. I think, you know, if you ask people, Have we done the right moves in a difficult situation around foreign policy? Have we gone after al Qaeda? Have we ended the war in Iraq, as promised? Have we prepared for a responsible transition in Afghanistan? Have we restored respect around the world? If you ask them how we have performed on things that do not have to do with the economy and do not have to do with Congress, they will give me high grades, right? So yes, it has to do with the economy. And there is nothing wrong with the American people holding me accountable, holding Congress accountable. I want that accountability. But what I think is gonna be important, not just next year, but over the next five years, is the American people looking at the choices we face, because we are at a crossroads. And determining, do we want a society in which we have a tax code where everybody's paying their fair share? Do we want a society in which we are making sure that young people have the chance to get a great education with excellent teachers and are able to go to college without incurring huge debt? Do we want a society in which we have still got, you know, the best science and the best research in the world, and the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world? Or do we think that an economy in which you are on your own and big corporations can write their own rules and we are gutting regulations... Which one is more likely to help middle-class families and people trying to get in the middle class? And that is the question that people are gonna be presented with. And I welcome that debate. I think it is a healthy debate for the country to have. And I think it is a debate we can win. Because I am absolutely convinced that the vision I am presenting is one that is true to the history of this country. And that is part of what I was talking about in this Kansas speech. It is true to the notion that we rise or fall together. And that, you know, when we are firing on all cylinders, because the guy on the factory floor and the guy on the executive suite are both doing well and they are both focused on making great American products and providing great American services and exporting around the world... That is the recipe for success that I think the American people are hungry for. It is just, right now, they have not seen enough of it yet. You definitely have some impressive accomplishments. Thank you, ENTITY. No, you do. And more than a lot of presidents who manage to get reelected. My question is, is it enough? Why do you think you deserve to be reelected? I think under some extraordinary circumstances, we not only saved the country from a potential disaster -- not only did we manage our national security at a time where there were severe threats and two wars going on, in a way that has made America stronger and more respected and put us in a better strategic position around the world and almost decimated our number one enemy, which is al Qaeda -- but what I have also been able to do is to, in very practical ways, put in place a series of steps that will allow middle-class families and those trying to get in the middle class to take back some of what they have lost over the last couple of years. Now, we are not there yet, but what I can say unequivocally is that everything I have done, every single day, and everything I will do as long as I am in this office is designed to make sure that every kid in America has the same opportunities that I had. Because I did not come from privilege. I have said before and I mean this -- this is the only country on Earth where my story is possible. And if I, as the child of a single mom, raised by a couple of grandparents -- one of whom would never have got more than a high school degree, the other of whom got some college because of the G.I. Bill -- was able to succeed. And my wife, who was the daughter of a blue-collar worker and a secretary was able to become First Lady of the United States. I want to make sure that that continues to be true for every child born in this country. And I do not think there is gonna be anybody out there who feels that more passionately or more personally, and who is gonna fight harder for those families, because they are my family. And they are my family's family. And they are Michelle's family. And ultimately, I think that the American people, as frustrated as they are, are gonna say to themselves, You know what? This guy's on our side. He is fighting for us. Because I am. Look, political campaigns are hard, being ENTITY's hard. Even among some of your supporters, strongest supporters, there is a sense, a little sense of disappointment. That they thought that you were gonna be bolder. That you were gonna take more steps. That you were gonna work outside the box, so to speak. Be a little unconventional. And they think you have been too cautious. That you have just kind of played it by the numbers. That is opposed to my critics, who think I have been this radical socialist. Look, ENTITY, you know, there was actually a good article written a while back, taking a look at the old press clips from every Democratic president, dating back to Franklin Roosevelt, including Roosevelt. And, you know, nobody was happy with them. Nobody was happy with them. You know? Bill Clinton, who is beloved by the Democratic Party, at this point -- and I consider to be an extraordinarily successful president -- you look at his old press clippings, he was getting beat up with some of the same stuff I was getting beat up with. Harry Truman, now lionized, you know? Give 'em hell, Harry. At the time, everybody was calling him a complete and utter disaster. F.D.R., people, for the first couple of years of his presidency, were saying, What he is doing's not working. You know? He was being called a radical by the business community. He was being called a sellout by the left. So this all comes with the territory, but this is not about me. This is not about me. You are absolutely right that if my goal was to maintain the extraordinary popularity that I had right after I made my convention speech in 2004, then I would have never left the Senate. I would have been sitting on 70% approval ratings. I would not have been leading this country, but people would be really attracted, because I would not have had to make any choices and make any decisions and exercise any responsibility. I took a different path. And as Michelle reminds me, You volunteered for this thing. So I do not spend a lot of time worrying about the criticisms day to day. What I do spend time worrying about is making sure that we are getting the policies right that will help people succeed, and give Americans the tools they have to navigate a new economy that is global, that is skills based, that is knowledge based. And we are doing that. Have you and Michelle ever had a conversation about whether you should really seek a second term? Have there been any doubts in your mind about not running again? No. Not because our quality of life might not be better if I were not ENTITY. Not because Michelle is so enamored with me being ENTITY. But because we both think that what we are doing is really important for a lot of people out there. And we meet people every day, who tell us it is important. You know, it is interesting, there was a letter in... Well, you do have 44% approval rating. Well, there are a lot of people around the country. I was thinking in more personal terms. There was a letter recently in the Los Angeles Times from a disillusioned ENTITY supporter, who was extraordinarily frustrated that I'd compromised over and over again. And the health care bill was a perfect example of compromise. We did not get the public option, you know? We trimmed our sails. Well, a lot of Democrats feel that way. And then this person had gotten sick. And because of the health care bill, they had health care. And the person wrote to the Los Angeles Times saying, Since this health care bill saved my life, maybe I have a slightly different attitude about these things. And the point is that every day I am meeting people, you know, young people who because we increased the Pell Grant and we stopped subsidizing banks in the student loan program and sent more money to kids, they are able to go to college. And every day we are meeting a military family who says, You know what? Because you reformed how the V.A. is doing business, or because of Michelle's efforts in supporting us, things are a little easier, given all the sacrifices we have made. Or we have got Mom, who is writing back, saying, You know what? My son just came back from Iraq. Thanks for keeping your promise. And so, that is why I do not have doubts, because those people tell me that in steady steps, not always as fast as I would like, we are moving this country in the right direction. One of the things that surprised me the most about this poll is that 42%, when asked who your policies favor the most, 42% said Wall Street. Only 35% said average Americans. My suspicion is some of that may have to do with the fact that there is not been any prosecutions, criminal prosecutions, of people on Wall Street. And that the civil charges that have been brought have often resulted in what many people think have been slap on the wrists, fines. Cost of doing business, I think you called it in the Kansas speech. Are you disappointed by that? Well, I think you are absolutely right in your interpretation. And, you know, I cannot , as ENTITY of the United States, comment on the decisions about particular prosecutions. That is the job of the Justice Department. And we keep those things separate, so that there is no political influence on decisions made by professional prosecutors. I can tell you, just from 40,000 feet, that some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street, in some cases, some of the least ethical behavior on Wall Street, was not illegal. That is exactly why we had to change the laws. And that is why we put in place the toughest financial reform package since F.D.R. and the Great Depression. And that law is not yet fully implemented, but already what we are doing is we have said to banks, You know what? You cannot take wild risks with other people's money. You cannot expect a taxpayer bailout. We are gonna ask you to set up a living will, so that if you are going down, we have already figured how to break it up, without harming the rest of the economy. So all those pieces are starting to be put in place right now. This is an example of where the resistance that we are getting out of congressional Republicans makes absolutely no sense. I mean, here we have got a situation where we set up a director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. A consumer watchdog, whose sole job it is to look out for ordinary folks, when they are dealing with mortgage brokers or payday lenders or debt collectors, so that they are not paying 400% interest or they are not signing a mortgage that they do not understand and lose their home after having paid for a year, because they were in over their heads. By the way, armed service members are some of the folks most likely to be affected by this. And the guy we nominated is uniformly considered qualified. Richard Cordray from Ohio, former attorney general, former treasurer. Democratic and Republican attorney generals say this is the right guy for the job. We cannot get him through. That is the kind of stuff that drives the American people nuts. Now if you ask them, whose fault is that? They will say everybody. You know? It is sort of a plague on all your houses. Because this place looks dysfunctional. And I understand that. But what I am gonna do is, I am just gonna keep on pushing and we are gonna find ways to get this guy in place to protect the American people, because it is the right thing to do. I am sure your poll numbers will probably automatically go up as soon as there is a Republican candidate in the race. I mean, that is normal. I mean, you are being judged now on your performance. No, no, no. I am being judged against the ideal. And, you know, Joe Biden has a good expression. He says, Do not judge me against the Almighty, judge me against the alternative. You have spent a lot of time -- your staff and the Democratic National Committee -- going after Mitt Romney, but the person that now seems to be definitely on the move is Newt Gingrich. Well, first of all, we have not spent a lot of money going after anybody. We have spent a lot of money building grassroots support and rebuilding the incredible infrastructure we had back in 2008. But I will tell you, ENTITY, whoever the Republican nominee is, they all seem to have the same philosophy. You were talking earlier about whether or not I was willing to compromise, because Republicans seemed prepared to compromise on deficit reduction. They had a debate, in which all of them who were on stage were asked, Would you be willing to take a deal to reduce our deficit that involved $10 of spending cuts for every dollar of revenue increases? And none of them raised their hands. None of them raised their hands. Now think about that. So, it does not really matter who the nominee is gonna be. The core philosophy that they are expressing is the same. And the contrast in visions between where I want to take the country and where they say they want to take the country is gonna be stark. And the American people are gonna have a good choice and it is gonna be a good debate. What do you make of this surge by former Speaker Gingrich? Look, he is somebody who is been around a long time. And is good on TV, is good in debates. But Mitt Romney has shown himself to be somebody who is good at politics, as well. He is had a lot of practice at it. And so, you know, I think that they will be going at it for a while. But, you know, I think having gone through the longest primary, I think, in the history of modern American politics, I can tell you that there are always a lot of twists and turns and ups and downs. And so I do not spend time worrying about what is happening with the Republicans on a day-to-day basis and fluctuations in poll numbers. When the Republican Party has decided who its nominee is gonna be, then we will have plenty of time to worry about it. There is this appearance that you did not really engage yourself during the deficit reduction negotiations that were taking place with the Special . Well, we, before they even met, we put out a very specific plan. Here is how to get, not just $1.2 or $1.5 trillion of deficit reduction. Here is how we can get $3.5 trillion of deficit reduction. This would actually stabilize our debt. Here is our plan. Very detailed. Here is how you do it. And then what we said was, Any kind of help you guys need. Any advice, any consultation that you want to engage with the White House on, we are there. But what we heard from both Democrats and Republicans, who were on the super committee was it would not necessarily be helpful for me to interject myself into the debate, precisely because of the dynamic in the Republican Party right now. Which is, if I am for it, it is very hard for Republicans to be for it, as well. They have gotta be against it. And so the thinking here was what we did not want to do is create a dynamic where actually solving the problem would be considered an ENTITY victory that would help him somehow in 2012. We wanted to make sure that if they were able to do it in a way that was unencumbered by politics, that we were fully supportive of that. Four years ago, Springfield, cold... It was freezing. You declared your candidacy. And you said, The reason we have not met our challenges is a failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics, the ease with which we are distracted by the petty and the trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to take on big problems. And those were eloquent words and true words. Unfortunately, they are still largely true today. Did you overpromise? Did you underestimate how difficult this was gonna be? I did not overpromise. And I did not underestimate how tough this was gonna be. I always believed that this was a long-term project; this was not a short-term project. And, you know, for individual Americans, who are struggling right now, they have every reason to be impatient. They should want all these things solved tomorrow. It does not matter how good my economic theories are. If you do not have a job right now, the only economic policy you want to hear is, I am hired. I have got a job. I can pay my bills. I can look after my family. But what I understood coming in was that reversing a culture here in Washington, dominated by special interests, reversing a political culture that was dominated by polls and sound bites and 24-hour news cycle, reversing structural problems in our economy that have been building up for two decades, that was gonna take time. It was gonna take more than a year. It was gonna take more than two years. It was gonna take more than one term. Probably takes more than one president. So I try to keep in mind the immediate challenges in front of me, day in and day out. How do I put people back to work and put steps in place that can help people get in the middle class and stay in the middle class? But then I also gotta take a long view and say, you know, How are we doing in moving this big aircraft carrier a few degrees to the left then or a few degrees to the right so that we are getting to the place where we need to go? And-- here is the good news. You know, America usually gets there. We do it in fits and turns, but we usually get there. You know, when I was dedicating the memorial to Dr. King, I reminded people, we had a couple hundred years of slavery, and a civil war, and segregation. And it was not until 1954 that Brown vs. Board of Education was issued, after enormous battles, generations of freedom fighters. And then it took another ten years before legislation was passed in Congress that could actually give effect to Brown vs. Board of Education, through the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. Then it took another ten years of enforcement before you actually started to see real differences in people's day-to-day lives. Then it took another ten years before, you know, both the economic and the political advancement of African Americans occurred. And we are still not there yet. Well, that is true of everything we do. That is true of the ability of working people to get a foothold in this new global economy. It is true of us making sure that we are cleaning up our environment, but also doing it in a way that encourages economic growth as opposed to discourages it. It is true of fixing our education system, so that every kid is learning what they need to. You know? These are things that take time. And so we are just gonna keep on plugging away. The one thing I have prided myself on before I was ENTITY -- and it turns out that continues to be true as ENTITY -- I am a persistent son of a gun. I just stay at it. And I am just gonna keep on staying at it, as long as I am in this office. And we are gonna get it right. And America will succeed. I am absolutely confident about that. Tell me, what do you consider your major accomplishments? If this is your last speech. What have you accomplished? Well, we are not done yet. I have got five more years of stuff to do. But not only saving this country from a great depression. Not only saving the auto industry. But putting in place a system in which we are gonna start lowering health care costs and you are never gonna go bankrupt because you get sick or somebody in your family gets sick. Making sure that we have reformed the financial system, so we never again have taxpayer-funded bailouts, and the system is more stable and secure. Making sure that we have got millions of kids out here who are able to go to college because we have expanded student loans and made college more affordable. Ending Do not Ask, Do not Tell. Decimating al Qaeda, including Bin Laden being taken off the field. Restoring America's respect around the world. The issue here is not gonna be a list of accomplishments. As you said yourself, ENTITY, you know, I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president -- with the possible exceptions of Johnson, F.D.R., and Lincoln -- just in terms of what we have gotten done in modern history. But, you know, but when it comes to the economy, we have got a lot more work to do. And we are gonna keep on at it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevekroftcbsnews60minutes1", "title": "Interview with Steve Kroft on CBS News 60 Minutes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-kroft-cbs-news-60-minutes-1", "publication_date": "09-12-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 146, "text": "ENTITY, thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to talk to you before your trip to Europe. My name is Fritz Pleitgen. I am with German Television. May I introduce to you my colleagues. Here to my left, Gerard Saint-Paul, TF-1, France. Jon Snow, ITN, Great Britain. Toyohiro Akiyama, TBS, Japan. Sergio Telmon, RAI, Italy. And last, not least, Joseph Schlesinger, CBC, Canada. And now, my first question. The controversy over your intended Bitburg cemetery visit is sharpening, and it overshadows the economic summit, and it spoils your idea of reconciliation. The Congress urge you not to go. The veterans urge you not to go. And the Holocaust victims urge you not to go. And the majority of the American people are against this visit. ENTITY, how does this turmoil of emotions affect you personally and politically and has the final word been spoken on Bitburg? The final word has been spoken as far as I am concerned. I think it is morally right to do what I am doing, and I am not going to change my mind about that. I do not believe it actually has affected a majority of the people here. As a matter of fact, some of our own people have done polls and surveys and reveal that this is not of that great a concern. Now, I can understand how some of the people feel, because very frankly I do not believe that many of your American colleagues-in that sense, I mean in the press-have been quite fair about this. I think they have gotten a hold of something, and, like a dog worrying a bone, they are going to keep on chewing on it. But this all came about out of a very sincere desire of Chancellor Kohl and myself to recognize this 40th anniversary of the war's end-and incidentally it is the 30th anniversary of our relationship as allies at NATO-that should not we look at this and recognize that the unusual thing that has happened-that in these 40 years since the end of that war, the end of that tragedy of the Holocaust, we have become the friends that we are, and use this occasion to make it plain that never again must we find ourselves enemy, and never again must there be anything like the Holocaust. And if that is what we can bring out of these observances and the trip that has been planned, then I think everything we are doing is very worthwhile. But there have been made mistakes in Bonn and in Washington, and is not it yours and Chancellor Kohl's obligation to correct these mistakes and solve this crisis? Well, I am not sure that I agree about mistakes. There have been mistakes with regard to information that was given on the various locales. Let me just point out one place in which I think the whole distortion started. And it started with me, perhaps in answering, incompletely, a question. When the invitation came to a state visit-and for the purpose that I have mentioned, because the Chancellor and I had talked about this, that there is no longer, after 40 years, a time when we should be out shooting off fireworks and celebrating a victory or commiserating a victory or a defeat. This is a time to recognize that after years and years, centuries, indeed, of wars being settled in such a way that they planted the seeds of the next war and left hatreds that grew and grew until there would be another war, that the miracle that has happened, that has brought 40 years of peace and 40 years of alliance, that those countries that were of the Axis and the countries of the allies-we are sitting down together in the summit-and do this every year-and we are friends and allies, that this was the thing that we were seeking to do. But the distortion came when I received what seemed to be a private invitation to go to one of the concentration camps, and I did not see any way that I, as a guest of the state and of the Government of Germany, could take off on my own and go, and that might then look as if I was trying to do something different than the purpose that we had in mind. And I received a cable from Chancellor Kohl that no, such a visit to-and it will be Bergen-Belsen-was included in the trip, and I immediately accepted. I thought it was appropriate in that way. The thing I thought was inappropriate, when it seemed that someone else was asking me to simply step away from the plans that were being made for me as a guest and go off on my own, and other than that mistake, I think that what has been planned is all in the spirit of recognizing what has been achieved. Your country now has the most democratic government it has ever had in its existence. You are, and have been for 30 years, one of the principal allies in the NATO defense for Western Europe and of the United States. And this is what we are seeking to recognize. But at the same time, I think I am free to say, just as your own people have said, and that is that we all must never forget what did take place and be pledged to the fact it must never take place again. ENTITY, sorry to insist on that, but the news report published in the New York Times says that some SS buried in Bitburg maybe participated in a massacre in Oradour. Oradour is a village in the south of France. And there were altogether 642 victims. Did you know that? How would you comment on that? Yes, I know all the bad things that happened in that war. I was in uniform for 4 years myself. And again, all of those-you are asking with reference to people who are in the cemetery, who are buried there. Well, I have said to some of my friends about that, all of those in that cemetery have long since met the supreme judge of right and wrong. And whatever punishment or justice was needed has been rendered by one who is above us all. And it is not going there to honor anyone. It is going there simply to, in that surrounding, more visibly bring to the people an awareness of the great reconciliation that has taken place and, as I have said before-too many times, I guess-the need to remember in the sense of being pledged to never letting it happen again. So, we go back to the Bonn summit, ENTITY. This summit could be a contribution to Western unity. Yes. But SDI, your strategic initiative of defense, does not provoke unanimity. For instance, President Mitterrand of France said yesterday in my TV station that the SDI technology is very interesting, but the strategy is maybe wrong. What do you answer to that? Well, perhaps at the summit if that subject comes up, perhaps I can clarify things for him so he will understand what it is that we have in mind. First of all, let us be perfectly aware that the Soviet Union has, over a longer period of time, has already embarked on that kind of research. And what would be the plight of all of us if the Soviet Union, which has the most and greatest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world, also had with it a defense against nuclear weapons and the rest of the world did not ? Now, what I think President Mitterrand needs to know is that all we are embarking on is research to see if there is the potential for a defensive weapon. And if there is, before any deployment took place, we would join with our allies-you, the countries that are represented here-with regard to any deployment and what our strategy regarding the use of that weapon should be. But as it stands now, the world is faced with a threat in which our only deterrent against nuclear attack is to threaten retaliation so that in a sense we are saying if you wipe out millions of our people, we will wipe out millions of yours. And it seems to me that if there is the possibility of having a deterrent that is more based on defensive weapons, which do not kill people but only kill weapons, that then we should be moving in that direction at the same time that we continue our effort to get the reduction between us of nuclear weapons. May I also say I know that President Mitterrand as well as Prime Minister Thatcher have problems in their own countries with regard to the support for your own nuclear arsenals. And because we are just going into a research and we do not know how long this is going to take, I am in full support of England and France continuing to go forward with their own programs of nuclear defense, nuclear deterrent. ENTITY, you suggested that this was a good moment to explain to anyone who was not certain-to President Mitterrand and others-the benefits of SDI. Yet would not it perhaps have been a better idea to explain all this and talk it out with the allies before you announced it? Is not there a sense in this, perhaps mirroring our first issue which was that of how to celebrate 40 years of peace, is not there a sense in which you have announced moves and only afterwards had to get the allies agreement? Well, I cannot remember the exact context of how an announcement was made or whether it was simply contained in our request going to our own legislature for the funding of such research. But as quickly as we could, we did go-and at the military level and at a higher level-we sent representatives over to brief all of the heads of your seven states as well as deal with your own military and our military leadership on this. Your aides say that you are very upbeat as you move towards this summit. Yet it is not been a good week for the person we have come to know as the Great Communicator. Is there any sense, particularly thinking of the contra vote and the confusion about Bitburg, is there any sense in which you feel something's happened to the Great Communicator in the last 10 days or so? No. I have had 4 years of fighting with the recognition that one House of our legislature is of the opposing party, as a majority of the opposing party. And your parliamentary systems-you do not have such things; the party and the individual are the same. But then, I had the experience of 7 out of 8 years as Governor of California having a hostile legislature, and yet we managed to accomplish a great many things. I have not given up on contra. Our position and the problem in Nicaragua, the vote up there and the debate, whether they admitted it or not, is simply: Do they want another totalitarian Marxist-Leninist government, like Cuba's, now on the mainland of the Americas, or do they want the people of Nicaragua to have the democracy that they are willing to fight for and that they did fight for in overthrowing the Somoza dictatorship? And whatever way they may want to frame it, the opponents in the Congress of ours, who have opposed our trying to continue helping those people, they really are voting to have a totalitarian Marxist-Leninist government here in the Americas, and there is no way for them to disguise it. So, we are not going to give up. As for the budget, we have just started that fight, and I am determined that we are going to carry through with a plan that puts us back on a course that ends deficit spending. But no, I do not feel I have been destroyed. ENTITY, let me change the subject. You have indicated your intention beginning a new round of trade talks. Given that some European countries may need some encouragement or some incentives to start talking early 1986, what would you do at the summit to try to encourage them? Well, I think that this is one of the subjects-it always has been-at the summits that we talk about, is the opposing of the forces in each of our countries who want increased protectionism in trade. Protectionism has never been successful, and it usually ends up creating great economic problems for everyone. We have had some fine bilateral discussions with your own Prime Minister, Prime Minister Nakasone. We have made great progress there in ridding ourselves of obstructions to back-and-forth trade, and so with our allies. We are all somewhat guilty, even though we profess we want free trade, and we all really know down in our hearts that it is the best way to go, there still are elements of protectionism that all of us practice. So, what we feel is, it is time to have another round of discussions to see how we can further liberalize and open up our markets to each other. But in connection with that kind of trade talk, I think most Europeans will probably want to gang up on the Japanese, on that other so-called Japan program. How would you do it? Well, we will try to see that no one gangs up on anyone else because, as I said, everyone is guilty. They have all got some elements of protectionism. And we need to get it all out on the table and see how, together, we can end those things that do bring about, well, trade measures that are unfair. ENTITY, your attitude after the nomination of Mr. Gorbachev at the Kremlin has been welcomed in Europe, your idea of having a meeting with him. I think that Mr. Gorbachev has taken a hard line, and do you still want to meet him, and what kind of meeting do you want? Well, yes I'd like to meet him. I have always believed that you only get in trouble when you are talking about each other instead of when you are talking to each other. And some people in my own country-again, some of your colleagues-have taken the tone that my expressing a desire to meet with him somehow is soft or not looking at reality. No, I think it is looking at reality. And I think that until we sit down and face each other, look each other in the eyes as you and I are now, and try to eliminate some of the mutual suspicions and express our own objections to some of the practices that have been going on, such as the recent, terribly tragic case of the murder of our Major Nicholson there-the only way to settle this is not standing here several thousand miles apart saying things about each other. It is to express ourselves to each other and express ourselves as to what is needed if we are going to ever end these hostilities or at least reduce them. And so, yes, I look forward to a meeting. In the meantime, Mr. Gorbachev is helping Ortega. What is the position of the United States vis-a-vis Nicaragua at the present? Do you rule out the use of force, the use of American troops- Yes. in the area? I have never considered it. What we have in Nicaragua is a revolution that was fought-and literally with our approval. The United States-I was not here then during the fighting of that revolution, but the United States stayed back. And anytime there is a revolution there are various factions, all of whom were opposed to the government that they are rebelling against, and they joined together. They promised all the other countries in the Americas-Canada, the United States, all the Latin American countries-they promised that their goal was a democratic government, with free elections, pluralism, free labor unions, human rights observed, freedom of speech and religion, and so forth. When the revolution was over, this country, under the previous administration, immediately went with aid-more financial aid to the new government of Nicaragua than had been given in 40 years to the previous government of Nicaraguare-but then saw them do exactly what Castro did in Cuba after his people won the revolution. The one faction, the Sandinistas-that faction eliminated all the other participants in the revolution. Some were exiled; some had to flee the country; many were jailed. And they drove them out, and then they made it plain, as Castro did in 1959, that they intended a Marxist-Leninist state. And they violated every promise they'd made to the Organization of American States. Now, the people that are so-called contras, that are fighting against this, are veterans of the revolution. They are not remnants of the previous government trying to get a dictatorship back in power. These are the people, many of them were imprisoned themselves by the previous dictator. And they are demanding a restoration of the democratic goals of the revolution. And we feel obligated to give them support. But the plan that we have asked the Congress to adopt is one in which those contras, themselves, have volunteered to lay down their weapons and ask them to be allowed to negotiate with their former companions in the revolution, the Sandinista government-negotiate how to restore the democratic goals. And they have asked that it be mediated by the church. Well, we have advanced that plan here and have said to the Congress that we will use whatever money is appropriated for food and medicines and so forth, not for military weapons. And we have the support of their allies-I mean, of their neighbors, Honduras and Costa Rica and Guatemala and El Salvador. The President of El Salvador has said that this is the right idea at the right time. And this is what we have asked of our own Congress, and it is what we want. We are not even seeking an overthrow of the present government. As a matter of fact, our plan says that while these negotiations go on, the present government stays in power. But it is simply for them to adopt the principles for which they said they were fighting in the first place. ENTITY, we have been talking about free trade or freer trade. At Quebec City in March, you and Prime Minister Mulroney pledged yourself to trying to eliminate trade barriers between our two countries. But we in Canada feel that there is a rise of protectionism in the United States, and certainly in the U.S. Congress. Now, I know you say there is a bit of protectionism in all of us; and there is. Now, there is also a report coming out in September. But I know, because I remember your campaign in 1980, when you talked about a North American common market, given the fact that you have been ENTITY now for 4 years, what sort of trade relationship would you envisage? What sort of new trade relationship would you envisage between Canada and the United States? Well, as free as possible. And of course, Canada and the United States, we are each other's largest trading partner. These two countries here and that several-thousand-mile border without so much as one fortification or one armed sentry along that border, we are very unique. We have everything in common, including our heritage and background and language and all. And it is true that here and there, there have come about those specific trade barriers or restraints. And what we have authorized on both sides is for our people at the ministerial level to get together and do the best we can to eliminate those barriers. And we, too, have made great progress, as I said earlier, with another country, with Japan. We have made great progress and some of the things that we celebrated there on this recent visit, the signing of some very basic agreements. So, I am quite optimistic about what is going to take place and how we can free up our border and rid it on both sides of these restrictions. You know, sir, in many ways, we in Canada feel like we are caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, the Canadian dollar has gone down vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. And all sorts of American producers are complaining that the competition in lumber, let us say, is unfair. On the other hand, in trying to seek new markets, we are up against the fact that the Canadian dollar is perhaps overvalued vis-a-vis overseas currencies. The question really is: How would you respond if Congress went ahead and put restrictions, let us say, on lumber trade and other sectors if trades or imports are being hurt? Well, I am opposed to it. And that is what I have had to tell our trading partners-Prime Minister Mulroney and Prime Minister Nakasone and the others-is to tell them that pressure is coming from elements in Congress who, for whatever their own reasons are, are trying to pass. And that is why it is beholden on us to make progress in eliminating these barriers before they try to have their way. Now, I am opposed to those protectionist proposals in the Congress. And of course, I ultimately do have some power, that of veto, for measures that might be passed. But we have to recognize it, just as I think that the Prime Minister in your country, just as Prime Minister Nakasone in his, I think are being pressed from the bureaucracy of their governments and from the legislatures as to restricting in how far they can go. So, between us, we just have to carry on the fight. And if we make enough progress in getting equal agreements between us, we take away the ammunition of those who are trying to force protectionism on us. Unfortunately the time is running out. We have just 3 minutes to go. A question-Soviet leader Gorbachev has just offered deep strategic arms cuts. Do you think it is a good proposal, or do you feel that he just wants to put you on the defensive? Well, if he is trying to put me on the defensive by asking for deep nuclear weapons cuts, I will not be on the defensive, because I will not defend against that. I was very optimistic before the talks started, when the late Chernenko and Foreign Minister Gromyko both publicly stated that they would like to see the elimination of nuclear offensive weapons. Well, I told Gromyko over in the Oval Office when he was here we could sign something right then, that that was our ultimate goal and that I was more than pleased to hear them say that it was theirs. Now, I recognize that that would probably have to be brought about by various stages of reductions in numbers of weapons; and we are very willing; and we have faced them there with proposals that make that evident, that we will join in real reductions of offensive nuclear weapons. Minister Gromyko said to me at one time: How long are we going to sit here on these mountains, ever getting higher, of such weapons? And I asked him then, I said: Well, we have it between us the ability to lower those mountains, and as long as we are equal at whatever level we stop, then we have a legitimate deterrent that would indicate that they will never be used. ENTITY, are you in favor of strong European unification, which of course is the thing of Europe itself, and do you intend to support it in your Strasbourg speech? Well, I do not know how far I should go in attempting to or appearing to be interfering in a problem that involves purely the European countries. I am gratified, and I think the world should be pleased, to see how the unity of Western Europe has-as far as it has come now. You know, 200 years ago, our first President, George Washington, in his farewell address to the Nation, urged them not to get involved in European affairs because of the rivalries and the enmities that existed between them. And here today that is no longer true. Here today we are all allied, and there is this spirit of unity, so I just would hesitate to voice an opinion as to how far they would go with a union of Europe. That, I think-I do not want the United States to sound as if we are interfering. Thank you very much, ENTITY. I wish you a pleasant and a good and a successful trip to Europe. Thank you very much. I am looking forward to it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists3", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-3", "publication_date": "29-04-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 547, "text": "ENTITY, can you hear me? Yes I can, Mr. ENTITY . ENTITY in San Francisco. I see you and hear you, loud and clear, sir. Go ahead. I do not know whether being fourth or fifth would be better in this round of interviews, but -- -- In baseball it is considered the best. Clean-up, clean-up hitter. Let us begin by talking about AIDS. Mr. ENTITY , drug users now represent the number one risk group for AIDS. Now, if we want to save lives, why not support the distribution of clean needles to drug addicts to prevent the spread of AIDS? Because I think, in a sense, that would encourage the drug habit. And so, I do not approve of that. I do not think that is the answer. I think education is the answer. I think the research that we are doing here at NIH and all across the country will prove to have the eventual real answer. Just as they discovered an antidote through the Salk vaccine to polio, I am confident that we will get one on AIDS. It is a little ways down the road. I worry that that would encourage drug use when we are trying to educate people off of drug use and treat those who have the addiction so that they will not use drugs. That is the reason I feel that it is not a good idea. What about condoms to teenagers now? Look, it is dealer's choice. Let them try it out there. You asked me my opinion, and I can add to it: Would I want this as a national program, something at the Federal level? No. Excuse me. What about condoms to teenagers, Mr. ENTITY ? Well, again, dealer's choice, but not for me, and not for the Federal Government. What I want to see is education. I do not think that just passing out condoms, giving up on lifestyle, giving up on family and fundamental values is correct. Indeed, I must tell you, I am worried about it. I am worried about so much filth and indecent material coming in through the airways and through these trials into people's homes. I think the American people have a right to be protected against some of these excesses. While people have a right to a fair trial, I think the American people have an overriding right to let those matters be decided behind closed doors. In terms of just national passing out condoms to people, I am not in favor of that. But I am in favor of teaching values that normally were taught in history by the family, by others pitching in, in schools and other places, to instruct and to encourage people to lifestyles that can prevent AIDS or can prevent pregnancy. That is what we need. Mr. ENTITY , do you think that Magic Johnson's admission that he is HIV-positive is going to encourage you and the administration to kick in more money for AIDS research? I do not think it is a question particularly of more money. Federal funding for research is up under our administration, and I am very proud of that. But we have a very good research team, headed by Dr. Tony Fauci and others out at NIH, and though they could use more money, and I will take a look at that in the Budget, they are not saying to me our research is starved out because of lack of funds. So, it is a question of doing as much as the Federal Government can, and taking pride in the fact that we have done more than anyone in the past, but we have got to find the answer to this question. And again, I am somewhat optimistic about that, having had a thorough briefing the other day. I will tell you what Magic's willingness to engage himself in this national commission will do: It will teach people that wayward lifestyles or just kind of unsafe sex at random is not the way it ought to work. And I think he will be witnessing to that, and I think that can have a great influence on young people in this country. I think it already has, as a matter of fact. Let us talk about the economy for a couple of minutes, Mr. ENTITY . Big corporations are now saying that they are restructuring, that these layoffs that they are going through are permanent. If that is the case, and The New York Times suggests that it is, what is the Federal Government going to do to adjust to this and to get people working again? New jobs. New jobs and new industries. And, you know, I keep coming back to it, and I think some of the people in your area understand it better than others do across this country: One thing that would help -- not entirely solve the problem -- is a capital gains tax reduction. Japan taxes it at 1 percent, Germany at zero. And we are asking our people that start up businesses to create new jobs, to go into the ball game with their hands tied behind their back. So, let the Democrats and the liberals tell me that this is a tax cut for the rich. I think it would do just exactly what needs to be done for those people whose businesses are shifting and whose businesses are changing and who lose a job because of changes in industry. That is one area. We have got some proposals for IRA's to stimulate the economy that we have had to the Congress, and I will try again on those. We have got a new highway bill tomorrow that will not solve the problem that you are talking about, the white-collar worker thrown out of work, but will help stimulate this economy by substantial amounts of Federal spending for construction projects. So, there is a lot of things working. I have accelerated $9.7 billion in Federal spending that would have been spent way back in the end of the year, and that will have an effect. But the answer is for those people that you talk about, is job retraining and new opportunities, which means economic growth. Mr. ENTITY , one final question. How about a Marshall plan for education, to get education moving? Please define what you mean by that. What we basically are trying to do in education is to try to move it along, to try and get it going again. And people are saying, Well, we need some help from the Federal Government. And the Federal Government seems to be encouraging it, but yet does not seem to be indicating there is any money available for it. Well, in the first place, Federal spending for education is way up. In the second place, Federal spending for education represents about 6 or 7 percent of the total money. Historically, and properly in my view, education spending is closest to the people. It is at the local school board level, the community level, and indeed, the State level. The Federal percentage is something like 6 or 7 percent, and it has gone up. Overall spending for education has gone from something like $115 billion 10 years ago to about $300 billion or over. I believe it is over that now. So, to those who say the answer is spending, they ought to take a look at our America 2000 education program which simply says this: Working cooperatively with Democrats, Republicans, Governors, we have defined six national education goals. And now what we are doing is saying the way to get those goals implemented is through a program called America 2000 that literally reorganizes and revolutionizes American education. And it is a good program. It is getting tremendous support in all of these States, including the State of California. So, I think the Federal Government is out front and leading. I do not think we ought to preempt the San Francisco schools. I do not think we ought to come in and say, Okay, here is your curriculum, here is your mandatory test, here is exactly how you ought to run your business. I think we have got the role defined properly, and I think it is adequately funded, though I wish we had more for it, and I know it is going to be a success. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY . Merry Christmas to you, Mr. ENTITY . Same to you and your family, and thanks a lot, and to all the people that listen to your program. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, Mr. ENTITY.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrichardbrownkgotvsanfranciscocalifornia", "title": "Interview With Richard Brown of KGO - TV in San Francisco, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-richard-brown-kgo-tv-san-francisco-california", "publication_date": "17-12-1991", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 429, "text": "We are here with ENTITY. It looks like you are having a great time. What do you think of the game so far? Great game, and our kids are playing well. But Michigan is playing a terrific game. They have done a great job defensing our big guys in the middle. And we have had the 3point shot, so we are a little ahead. But this is a good game. We saw you really excited after some Arkansas baskets, but we also want to show you a couple of other times where it did not go so well for the Hogs, and here is how you reacted. Tell us about it. They were missing layups. We missed about five layups there, four in the beginning. We need a little more coaching here, Mr. President. We missed another layup. Well, Chelsea's been calling the Hogs a few times. I have not seen you up doing that quite yet. I have not done it. I will get into it as we go along. I really get into the game. I am impressed, though. It is a good, good basketball game. You are going to talk to both teams after the game, I understand. I'd like to do that if we What are you going to tell them? That they have got a lot to be proud of. Both these teams have got a lot to be proud of. And this Michigan team of course, they have these four guys that have been to the last game twice without an enormous amount of depth, they are playing incredible defense, and they are doing very well. So we will just see. I hope we win, but it is going to be a tight game. How much have you been able to watch the Razorbacks so far in the tournament, up until today? I have watched all the games. I watch them all. And I have watched a lot of the other games, too. Do you have any words for Nolan Richardson? Have you had a chance to send a little tip in to the team? He does not need it, though, right? I am trying to learn about basketball from him, not the other way around. I just sit and watch and learn. If Arkansas holds on and wins this game, are you going to Charlotte? Are you going to go with them? Oh, yes, I will go. Both semifinals and possibly championship game, too?

{"id": 333, "text": "Hello everyone. My name is ENTITY, and I am ENTITY of the News Lab at Google, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to a YouTube interview with ENTITY of the United States. thanks for having us here today. Great to see you, ENTITY. Thanks. We are really excited for this interview, today. I should tell our viewers just what a YouTube interview is. Right. Grove: We have invited three top YouTube creators here to the White House today, we are in the East Room, and they have set up their own YouTube sets right here in the White House for a very special YouTube video with a very special guest, ENTITY of the United States. Now, they have been asking their millions of subscribers on YouTube what they should ask you in today's interview. None of those questions has ENTITY seen before. And we have also been taking a look on Google at what Americans were searching for during your State of the Union address. So ENTITY, this is data that we have collected anonymously across all of Google searches in America, top questions that people asked during your State of the Union speech included, what is middle class income? Why are gas prices dropping? People also want to know stuff like, how much does ENTITY make? When does his term end? What does the speaker of the House do? Right. So these are things that are on people's mind as they watch your speech. Next, we sort of backed up and looked at the issues. Yep. So of all the issues you addressed during the speech, which issues were Googled most during your State of the Union? College, number one, far and away, followed by taxes, housing, employment, education. Finally, ENTITY, you might be curious: what was the most asked question on Google during the first 10 minutes or so of your State of the Union? Right. It was how old is ENTITY? You can see this huge spike as you begin your speech, and then, you know, throughout, people very curious about how old you are. Go figure. Well, let us get straight to the interview. We will show you more Google trends throughout the conversation today, but let us get right to the questions. Good. I want to introduce you first to ENTITY of the Vlog brothers. I am only going to get one shot at this. I do not think I am going to get a lot of chances to interview ENTITY, so I am going to jump right in. Let us do it. Start grilling you. I watched the State of the Union. Yeah. A lot of really interesting ideas there. I am not the only person who is said this: a little worried that none of them are at all politically feasible. Am I wrong? Well, first of all, there is some areas where I think we can get some Republican cooperation on infrastructure, for example. Historically, that has not been a partisan issue: roads, bridges; now that we are in the 21st century, broadband lines into communities that do not have good access; making sure we have got a first class power grid so that we are not leaking a lot of energy and we can produce more energy without causing more carbon pollution. So there is some areas where, I think right away we can get some cooperation. There is some areas where it is important for us to frame the debate and get the American people behind us, because even if something does not happen immediately here in Washington, it starts having an impact around the country. A great example of that is the minimum wage. I called for the -- a rise in the minimum wage last year, and Congress still has not passed it yet. But in the meantime, you have got 17 states, you have got cities and others that are raising the minimum wage. And so, it creates movements that ultimately, you know, change things in Washington, as well. So, you used the phrase, middle-class economics ... Yeah. ... in the speech, which I think is a -- is an idea that we needed a phrase for. Right. But when I first told people I was going to be able to come talk to you, a lot of them expressed that they felt like the government was never going to have their interests at heart because the government existed to protect the interests of corporations and business. And the thing that they use is -- like, the prime example of this is taking former leaders of industry and putting them in positions where they are regulating the industries they used to be in charge of. Right. Is that a legitimate concern? And do you understand where those people are coming from? Yeah. You know, look, I understand people's skepticism and cynicism. On the other hand, think about a bunch of stuff that government does do. I mean, since I have been in office, we have been able to take away money that was being siphoned off by banks in the student loan program. And billions of dollars are now suddenly going directly to students to make it easier for them to finance their student loans. You know, simple stuff that we often take for granted, like Social Security or Medicare for -- in the case of many of your viewers -- your -- their grandparents. Mm-hmm. You know, that is a government program that helps a lot of people. And so, you know, what is true is that too often, lobbyists and special interests are able to block efforts to make the system fairer and to make it work better. But our history shows that when people get involved, when they get engaged, when they vote, that, in fact, change happens. It does not always happen 100 percent and it does not always happen immediately, but it happens. So -- we are going to jump around a lot here... Sure. ... because I have a lot of topics. I understand. It is -- I do not have a lot of... It is OK. ... it is just crazy that I have to do this. I am going to keep my questions -- my answers as short as possible. I -- I appreciate you doing that. All right. I will try to zip through it. So, I feel like whenever a new weapons technology is developed, we spend five or 10 years sort of coming to understand the full implications of that new technology. And sometimes, we look back at those initial years of its use as... Yes. ... like we maybe misused or overused that technology. Right. Are you at all worried that your administration is going to be seen as a time when drone strikes were a technology like -- that we see as over or misused? Well, you know, basically, drone technology came into its own right when I first came into office. We have tried to put a series of constraints on how it is used. But understand that our goal has always been, how do we target very specific terrorists who are, you know, proven to be trying to kill us? Or, more frequently, kill innocent Muslims in their home countries? And how do we do that with -- with as little damage to the surrounding communities and innocent people as possible? You know, part of what is really tough for me as commander in chief is the fact that any kind of war is damaging. Any kind of war results in casualties. And, in fact, the sort of damage that may have taken place with a drone strike is always significantly less than if I ordered a raid into a village where a high-value terrorist target was. So, you take the bin Laden operation in Pakistan, for example. Probably as successful and as effective an operation as we could have imagined. Well... You know, there were some people killed in that operation. And the truth of the matter is that anytime we are going after terrorists who are embedded in communities, there are dangers there. But I think it is entirely legitimate to say that as new technologies develop, we have to make sure that we step back and say: Do we have a legal framework? And a set of controls on it? Because I think what people worry about is that it is a little more antiseptic than when we send troops in; that it may seem as if there is no cost to it. And we have tried to do that. And I think there have been some lessons learned, and occasionally there've been mistakes that have been made, and, you know, nobody grieves over that more than I do. But it is -- it is something that we take very seriously. And I would argue that today's technologies can enable us to defend ourselves, causing less damage to those communities than in the past. Sort of along those lines, there is a lot of bad things happening in the world, but I feel like none more so than the kind of generations-long oppression and even genocide that is been happening in North Korea. We recently, you know, implemented new sanctions against North Korea because of a cyber attack against us. Now, it is obviously a problematic cyber attack, but no one was physically hurt. Right. I was surprised to find that there were any sanctions that we could sanction that had not been sanctioned yet. Like -- like, how was there anything left? I feel like, as the strongest nation in the world, like it feels wrong that such injustice could exist in the world. No, look, North Korea is the most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on earth. And the kind of authoritarianism that exists there, you almost cannot duplicate anywhere else. It -- it is brutal and it is oppressive. And as a consequence, the country cannot really even feed its own people. There are not that many sanctions left. I mean, we keep on trying to ratchet it up a little bit higher. Over time, you will see a regime like this collapse. Our capacity to effect change in North Korea is somewhat limited because you have got a million-person army and they have nuclear technologies and missiles. That is all they spend their money on, essentially, is on their war machine. And we have got an ally South Korea right next door, that if there were a war would be severely affected. So, the answer is not going to be a military solution. We will keep on ratcheting the pressure. But part of what is happening is the environment that we are speaking in today, the Internet, over time is going to be penetrating that country and it is very hard to sustain that kind of brutal authoritarian regime in this modern world. Information ends up seeping in over time and change -- bringing about change. And that is something that we are constantly looking for way to accelerate. So I -- sometimes people think I do -- but I do not smoke pot. And I -- it just is not for me. I think that it is bad for my brain. I am not into it, but other people think I do smoke pot because I am -- I am in favor of legalizing marijuana. Right. And we are in a really weird place... Yeah. ... with marijuana right now. Like, it is illegal in some places, but -- it is illegal everywhere, but in some places it is kind of OK. But if the state think it is not OK, then let us throw those people in jail. I feel like it -- it -- you know, it leads to excessive incarceration, especially among minorities. And in places where it is been legalized, everything's doing OK. Yeah. How do we move forward out of this legal gray area weirdness? Well, what you are seeing now is Colorado, Washington, through state referendum. They are experimenting with legal marijuana. The position of my administration has been that we still have federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. But we are not going to spend a lot of resources trying to turn back decisions that have been made at the state level on this issue. My suspicion is that you are going to see other states start looking at this. What I am doing at the federal level is asking my Department of Justice just to examine generally how we are treating nonviolent drug offenders. Because I think you are right. You know, what we have done is instead of focusing on treatment, the same way we focused, say, with tobacco or drunk driving or other problems where we treat it as a public health problem, we have treated this exclusively as a criminal problem. And I think that it is been counterproductive, and it is been, you know, devastating in a lot of minority communities. It presents the possibility at least of unequal application of the law. And that has to be changed. Now, the good news is, is that we are starting to get some interest among Republicans, as well as Democrats, in -- in reforming the criminal justice system. We have been able to initiate some changes administratively. And last year, you had the first time in 40 years where the crime rate and the incarceration rate went down at the same time. I hope we can continue with those trends because there is just a smarter way of dealing with these issues. ENTITY, the next topic that we are going to cover is another angle on cybersecurity. Yeah. We thought you'd be interested to know that searches on Google for cybersecurity have really risen over the past couple of years to the point where now more people are searching for cybersecurity than national security overall. So, clearly a topic on a lot of people's minds. Right. To tackle this topic and a lot of others I want to introduce you to our next YouTube star, ENTITY. Thank you very much. All right. Let us get started. My social media reaches over five million fans. That is a lot of people. Thank you. Especially now. But I feel like I thought I was able to say whatever I wanted to say whenever I wanted to say how I wanted to say it because it was mine. But then the Sony hacking thing happened. Right. Right. And it is like why did not the government help Sony feel protected and safe enough to release the film on time? Because something like that, the fallout affects me. Well, look. Cybersecurity is a huge issue we have been working on since I came to office. And in fairness, the administration before me probably was starting to work on it. Although the changes in the media have happened so fast and so much stuff is going online today that it becomes that much more important. The challenge we have got is that most of the Internet and the infrastructure that allows you to be posting on YouTube and people accessing your stuff, most of that stuff's in private hands. It is not in public hands. And so what we have to do is to work with private companies telling them here is what we are seeing, here is how you can protect yourself, here is how you should share information with other companies who start seeing hackers getting into their stuff so that everybody can pool the information and we can all protect each other together. And it moves very fast because these hackers are -- you do not have to have a lot of equipment in order to be able to do this hacking. In fact, the hacking against Sony, which we believe was done by North Korea, it was not even that sophisticated. But it just goes to show how vulnerable we are. So we continue to do more with private industry, to share with them best practices to how they can protect themselves. It is sort of like with your own ATM machine -- ATM card or your pass code, your passwords, your personal privacy. There is certain things you can do to make yourself more protected. So we are sharing that information with them. But what we are also asking Congress to do is pass a law that would give us more tools to fight against this in the future. And I am confident that this is something we can actually get some good bipartisan support for. So you are going to be all right. People are going to still be able to watch your show, I promise. OK. OK. I have three family members who are in the law enforcement. And my husband who painted there, he is retired from the Air Force. Well, we are grateful for his service. You tell him thank you. I will do that. However, he is mad at me right now because I cut all the hoods off his hoodies. I did. I did that for real... I understand. ... to protect him because I am afraid when he goes outside that somebody might shoot and kill him. And it is not like regular folks. It is the po-po. I hope that this changes. How can we bridge the gap between black, African- American males and white cops? Well, first of all, we always have to just remind ourselves that the overwhelming majority of police officers, they are doing a really tough job and they are doing it well. And they are doing it professionally. What we also know is that there is still biases in our society that in split-second situations where people having to make quick decisions that studies have shown African-American males are seen as more threatening, which puts them in more vulnerable positions. Yes. Young African-American males are typically seen as older than they are. And so a lot of the way to solve this is to improve training so people can be aware of their biases ahead of time. And when I was in the state legislature back in Illinois, for example, I passed a racial profiling bill. It essentially said how are we going to tackle this problem? Let us make sure we are keeping track of the race of everybody that was being stopped. And just by the small fix of keeping track, suddenly each cop when they were about to make a traffic stop they had to think, OK, am I stopping this person because I should be stopping them? Or is some bias at work? And just that kind of mindfulness about it ended up resulting in better data, better policing, more trust by the communities that are affected. And we can do some of that same stuff and use those same tools. I have put together a task force with police and community activists, including some of the young people who were actively involved in the Ferguson protest to make sure that we come up with what are the best training practices, what are the best tools, more body cameras on police officers so that they know they are being watched... Yes. ... and how they are operating. And we are going to take some of those recommendations and we are going to put federal muscle behind them to see if we can make sure the communities all across the country are implementing them. Thank you. There you go. Well, it'll be -- it is something that I think everybody, not just African-Americans or Latinos, but everybody should be concerned about... Yes. ... because you get better policing when communities have confidence that the police are protecting and serving all people and not in any way showing bias. And that is something that we should all have an interest in. Amen to that. There you go. OK. OK. I grew up in Florida... Yes. And I have a lot of friends, close friends, who are Cuban-American. Right. And I have heard the stories of their families escaping... Right. ... and some of them did not even make it to come to the United States for a better life, to get away from the Castros. Right. OK. I mean, the guy puts dic in dictatorship. So I am trying to understand how do you justify dealing with the Castros? Well, here is what is happened. We have had the same policy since I was born, which was we were going to have an embargo. We were going to cut off all contact, all communication. And nothing changed. And you know I have said this before. When you do something over and over again for 50 years and it does not work, it is time to try something new. And we started off initially by allowing more travel to Cuba by Cuban-Americans to visit their family, sending more money back to their family members to help them back in Cuba. We have been doing that for the last four or so years. And it turns out it is been helpful to the people in Cuba. They have more contact with their family. It gives them more hope. Now what we are saying is that by normalizing relations we are going to be able to still put pressure on the Cuban government. But also what happens is now you have got more visitors to Cuba. You start getting telecommunications into Cuba. You start getting the Internet into Cuba. People's minds begin to change. There is more transparency about what is going on. And over time what you are going to see, gradually, is a shift. Because not everybody in Cuba's able to escape to the United States, and the goal ultimately is to make sure that there is freedom in Cuba, not just for the folks who have left. This is dependent on the Supreme Court ruling, but do you think that same-sex marriage will be legalized in all of United States during the time that you are in office? And what can you do to push that along? Well, we have done a lot, obviously, to push it along. I announced my belief that same-sex marriage should be legal that people should be treated the same. We argued against -- as an administration before the Supreme Court we argued against the Defense of Marriage Act that was treating married couples, same-sex couples differently in terms of federal benefits. The Supreme Court now is going to be taking on a case. My hope is that they go ahead and recognize what I think the majority of people in America now recognize, which is two people who love each other... Yes. ... and are treating each other with respect, and are not bothering anybody else, why would the law treat them differently? Why? Why? I mean why? There is no good reason for it. No. So as a consequence I think that I am hopeful the Supreme Court comes to the right decision. But I will tell you, people's hearts have opened up on this issue. I think people know that treating folks unfairly, even if you disagree with their lifestyle choice... Exactly. ... the fact of the matter is they are not bothering you. Let them live their lives. And under the law they should be treated equally. Yes. And as far as me personally, you know just to see all the loving gay and lesbian couples that I know who are great parents... Yes. ... and great partners. You know the idea that we would not treat them like the brothers and sisters that they are, that does not make any sense to me. Yes. Thank you. You are welcome. OK. You are almost done with me, and your time as ENTITY. Yes. With the time left, what would you hope your legacy is? Well, we saved an economy that was on the brink of depression. We have created 11 million new jobs. We have doubled clean energy. We have reduced pollution. We have made sure that more young people can go to college. We have given now so far 10 million people health insurance that did not have it before. And that is going to grow over time. You know we have ended two wars in a responsible way. But we still have challenges. Every day I wake up and I ask myself in particular how can I make sure that folks who are working hard can, not just survive, but how can they thrive? How can they get ahead? And so in the State of the Union that I just gave we talked about how can we provide more help for young families with childcare, huge burden on a lot of people? How can we make sure that college is more affordable? And what I want to do is make sure that the first two years of community colleges are free so that young people can you know have confidence that if they go and try to get more skills that they are not going to be paying through the nose in terms of a lifetime of debt. You know I want to make sure that we are doing more to raise the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave. So there is a lot of basic stuff that we can do that would ensure the economy goes strong, but more importantly that everybody benefits from a strong economy. And that is going to be my focus over the next two years. And once I am done then I will look back and I will see what the legacy is. But hopefully it'll be one in which I am making sure that everybody in this country can succeed. All right, ENTITY. So the next issue we are going to tackle is education. Yes. Something you talked a lot about in your State of the Union. You'd be interested to know that traditionally when people were searching on Google for stuff around college the number one question they asked was what should I bring with me to college. Right. So in the past couple years the number one question has become how to pay for college. Yes. So clearly a topic that a lot of people want to know more about. And to tackle that question and many others we have a very popular YouTube creator next, ENTITY. All right. All right. So I am very excited to hear your answers so I am just going to dive into the questions. Let us go. So my first question for you is regarding education. Yes. I am 19 years old. A lot of my friends are the same age as me, as well as my online audience. And a lot of them are now going to college or are already in college. So my question for you is how can -- what do you think is the best long-term plan for making education as a whole more affordable for students? Well, a couple of things. First of all, college remains the best investment you can make. If you want to do anything right now in this 21st century economy, you are going to be measured by how much knowledge you have and how adaptable you are to changing circumstances. And college, it is not just that it gives you a particular skill, but it also teaches you how to learn you know for your whole life. Right. And you know so it is the key to the future. One of the things that we have done is to make sure that more young people have access to Pell Grants, more people have access to student loans that are lower interest rate. Now I have proposed to make community colleges free for the first two years. And that is a good option for a lot of young people. There're four-year colleges, but a lot of times you can go to a community college for your first two years and then transfer your credits and go to a four-year college. But you have already gotten your first two years free. And we know that it is already working in places like Tennessee. We want to take that all across the country. And then what we have done is we have also said once you get out, if you have got some debt then we want to be able to cap how much you pay back to 10 percent of your income. So that if you decide to become a teacher or a social worker or some helping profession that does not pay a lot, you do not feel like well I cannot do that job because my debt burden's going to be too high. But the single most important thing for your viewers is number one, you will be able to figure out a way to pay for college. But you got to be a smart shopper. You got to know ahead of time how much does a school cost. If they tell you well, we will help you finance it, do not worry, you have got to understand you are going to be taking on some debt. And what is it going to look like once you are finished. Right. You should have some sense of whether you can get in- state tuition versus going to a school out of state because there may be a big difference in terms of cost. And one of the things we are also doing is seeing if we can get more high schools to work with their local colleges so that while you are in high school you can start getting some college credits. That may make it quicker for you to get your college degree. And you know the quicker you get your degree the cheaper it is going to be. That is awesome. Yes. Thank you. My next question I actually relate to on a very personal level because when I was younger I was cyber bullied, which affected me in a very big way. So I went online and I basically spoke about my story, which then a lot of my viewers online came to me leaving comments and asking for tips and advice on you know how I dealt with it. And obviously you know I can give them tips based off of my experience. But sometimes I feel like I reach a point where I just cannot help them as much as I would truly love to. So my question for you is how can we prevent that, prevent bullying in schools and online? Because it is something that happens on a daily basis. Well, I have got to say this is one area where I think your voice is more powerful than ENTITY of the United States you know because peers are going to have more influence than anybody. And when they see young people like you who are willing to speak out and say that is not right and protect other people from this kind of bullying, cyber bulling or any kind of bullying. That is what changes people's minds. That is what has an impact on them. Suddenly it is like oh I guess it is not so cool for me to do that because... Right. ... somebody I respect or somebody who is like me is telling me you know to act differently. So we had a big conference here at the White House in order to prevent bullying. And you know we had a whole bunch of organizations who came together and they were in workshops and looking at various ways of dealing with the issue. But the really most powerful testimonies came from students and young people like you who had organized themselves... Right. ... and were going from campus to campus, school to school, going online and just explaining why you know that is -- you know that kind of bullying tactic is something we can guard against if everybody kind of speaks out against it and uses positive peer pressure to say that is just not acceptable. So you are already doing it. Thank you. I think you have better advice than just about anybody about it because you experienced it. You felt it. Thank you so much. You bet. So last April Boko Haram kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls. And just last month this actually happened again. And a lot of them are still missing. Yes. So what do you think we can do to raise awareness about this issue, and also just prevent it from happening again? Well, as people may know or may not know, Boko Haram is a radical, violent, terrible extremist organization in Nigeria. And they kidnapped 200 young women. And are -- they are in many cases still being held. What we tried to do is to help the Nigerian government to deal with the problem. The Nigerian government has not been as effective as it needs to be in not only finding the girls, but also in stopping this extremist organization from operating inside their territory. And what we are trying to do is mobilize other countries to try to give the Nigerian government more resources, not just military equipment but better intelligence, allowing them to track where these folks are, and to try to stop them. And you know it is hard. But I tell you, the more young people are engaged in issues like this and speak out and let their elected officials know that they care about it, the more attention that is paid to it. And ultimately that is how you solve these problems. And look, there are a lot of really heartbreaking situations all around the world. There are a lot of countries that are still struggling. You know during your lifetime more people have come out of poverty and more people have been able to feel more secure around the world than probably any time in human history. But there is still a lot of bad stuff going on out there. And that is why it is so important for young people like you to educate yourselves about the issues and to speak out and get involved. And over time -- we are not going to solve every problem overnight. But we can have some positive impact. Yes. I completely agree. My next question for you -- so, I was actually just in China. I travel a lot. And I connected to the Internet. And I could not help but notice I could not access the apps and the websites that I do back home. And I just felt kind of isolated from like the online global community. Right. So how can we make them a part of that? Well, you know China and Russia and some other countries around the world that do not have a democratic government and do not have the same traditions of free speech and open Internet, they have recognized. I think that the Internet's so powerful that if people start being able to communicate then they maybe start criticizing the government. And then they may be able to mobilize opposition. And things that are unfair or people who are being mistreated suddenly have a voice. So they are trying to keep a lid on things. And we consistently, wherever we go, insist that issues like free speech and a free and open Internet, we think that that is part of who we are as a people. We think that that has value not just in America but everywhere. We obviously cannot make laws in China. But what we can do is let them know and shine a spotlight on some of those practices and indicate to them that any government that is afraid of its own people and people just peacefully trying t speak out and voice their own opinions is over the long term not going to be as effective and as long-lasting as a government that trusts its people to be able to communicate freely. Got it. Thank you so much. So I am going to be honest with you. Yes. Before I came here to do this interview for YouTube I never really followed politics that much. You are not the only one. A lot of my online audience and just the younger generation do not seem as interested in it. And I personally think that we should be. So my question for you is why should the younger generation be interested in politics? And why should it matter to them? Well, basically politics is just how do we organize ourselves as a society? You know how do we make decisions about how we are going to live together? So, young people care about how college is paid for? Well, the truth of the matter is that the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said you know what? We should start colleges. And dating back to Abraham Lincoln, who started something called the land grant colleges. And he understood that government should invest in people being able to get an education and having the tools to succeed. Well, you guys are the ones who are going to be using these colleges and universities. And if they are not getting enough funding from government and your tuition goes up then you have got more debt. You are the ones affected. So you better have a voice and know what is going on and who is making decisions about that. You are right. You know if you care about an issue like you know making sure the gays and lesbians and transgender persons are treated fairly. Well, laws on the books can make sure that they are not discriminated against. But those laws only pass if politics allows those laws to pass. You know the environment. I am a lot older than you. You are going to be around a lot longer than I am. And if the climate keeps on getting warmer and we have more droughts and more floods and you know the oceans start dying off. You know it is going to be you and your children who are dealing with that. We can stop it. But we can only stop it if we get together and we start using energy differently. And so there is no decision in our lives basically that is not touched in some way by the laws that we have. And we are really lucky that we live in a democracy where our voice matters. But if we do not participate -- it is sort of -- look. I will bet there're a bunch of your friends -- here is -- it is as simple as this. You decide you guys want to go see a movie, and you got a group of friends. And you know somehow you got to figure out which movie you are going to go see because not everybody's going to agree all the time. You are going to have to have a debate. And you are going to have to make an argument. And then eventually -- so you are going to have to compromise... Right. You know otherwise you guys are not going to be hanging out together too much. Well, the same is true for our country. You know we have got to make decisions about which direction we are going to go in, what we are going to be doing, how we are going to spend our money, how we are going to treat each other. And you do not want to be the person that just says OK, whatever. Whatever you guys want to do, I will just do that. You want to express your voice and your values and what you care about. And that is what politics is. It is not really that complicated. It is just -- it is something that people do all the time with their friends and with their family. They negotiate. They compromise. They try to figure out how do we live together? And this is just done at a national level. And some of the issues get pretty complicated. But usually the values are the same ones that you talk about all the time. How do we treat each other with kindness? How do we look after one another? How are we fair to each other? You know and I think that young people usually have good instincts. But sometimes they just get turned off by all the noise and yelling on TV. And that is not how politics has to be. Thank you so much. All right. So my audience had a lot of fun questions for you so we are going to do a quick lightening round. OK. Lightening round, I am really quick. OK. So I know you have a lot to do, obviously... Yes, I do. ... but if you have any free time, what TV show or movies do you watch? You know I am really big on sports. So the truth of the matter is that I am mostly watching SportsCenter. All right. Whenever I am working out in the gym, if there is a basketball game or a football game on I am usually tuned in there. Nice. Yes. OK. What did you want to be growing up? I wanted to be a bunch of different things. I wanted to be an architect for a long time. Wow. Nice. And I suppose in the back of my mind at some point I thought playing in the NBA would be great, being a basketball player. That ended around the age of 13 when I realized I was not talented enough. Aw. It is OK. Things worked out pretty good. I would say so. Yes. I would definitely say so. Exactly. And the last one is if you had any superpower what would it be? Any superpower? You know I guess like the flying thing seems pretty cool right, sort of zipping around and... I would love it. You know. As long as you could stay warm. The invisibility thing seems like a little sneaky to me you know. It is like what are you going to be doing with that? You are going to be listening in on people's conversations. You know I -- so the -- I guess the flying thing. One time somebody asked me this and I gave an answer that my wife Michelle teased me. She thought this was really nerdy. But it is OK. I will go ahead and tell you anyway. And I do not know if this is a superpower, I'd love to be able to speak any language. I would love... That is actually... ... anybody... ... amazing. ... I met anywhere in the world I could just talk in their language. To me that would be really cool. I love that. Is not that a cool one? I would love that too. Yes. But I do not think it'd make a really good movie. You know it is not that exciting. It is a really good one though. See. I have never heard that one before. All right. There you go. Actually one more question for you. Yes? Can you take a selfie with me? Let us do it. , ENTITY. Thank you so much for your interview. We had a lot of fun with it today. No, no. Thank you so much. And I am so proud of what you guys are doing because... : Thank you. ... this is the power of you know what the Internet's all about. You know you can create content and there is not all these barriers to entry. And suddenly you know you get millions of people who are listening to you and in a conversation with you. And it is a great treat for me because more and more there're audiences that get turned off by the traditional news shows or the traditional debates. And so for me to be able to reach your audiences and just hopefully give them a sense of -- that what we do here in Washington, what government does actually matters, makes a difference in their lives. I hope it is been useful. All right. Yes. Thank you so much. So good luck. Thank you. We are very proud of you. All right. Thank you. Just to our viewers, if you missed the first part of the interview or you want to watch it again, just go to YouTube.com/WhiteHouse. Thanks, everybody. Goodbye. OK. Thanks, ENTITY. Thanks, ENTITY. That was a lot of fun. No, you are welcome. Thanks a lot. Yes.

{"id": 206, "text": "I appreciate this fine effort by your United States Chamber and the National Alliance of Business. Both your organizations have made major contributions to increasing private sector training and job opportunities for all Americans especially for those in need. I understand this program will be beamed to some 37 locations around the country and viewed by corporate and community leaders anxious to make the Job Training Partnership Act a success. Well, that is great news, because I know there is one concern all of us share. While we have made solid progress against the disease that crippled our economy the runaway inflation, taxes, and interest rates unemployment remains far too high. It is unacceptable. Our administration's most urgent priority is to see that we have enough jobs for all the people who want to work. We need the strength of every back and the power of every mind if we are to lift our country up again to greatness. As lower inflation and interest rates began sparking a rebound in bedrock industries, something that is now begun in housing, we will see the job market expanding again. Recovery will come gradually, because we are determined not to repeat the quick-fix mistakes of the past. Our administration intends to build a new kind of recovery, a recovery that will last. But as our program takes hold, we can take action to bring unemployment down faster without igniting the bonfires of high inflation and interest rates. We can take action to lower structural unemployment and to promote more savings and investment the keys to stronger growth, more jobs, and a higher standard of living. These initiatives can be taken at the national level, but their success depends on your leadership and support at the grass roots. When we talk about structural unemployment, we mean the kind of unemployment that is not always cured by a general economic recovery. Our goal is a full-employment economy. So, we must design policies to solve structural unemployment. For example, 40 percent of the unemployed in America are less than 25 years old, and almost one-half of that group are teenagers. They are unemployed because our labor market is not matching people with jobs. We must find ways to strengthen their skills and to provide new opportunities for prospective workers of all ages as America works to get the investment or to meet the investment challenge, I should say, of the eighties. Now, one such initiative, the Job Training Partnership Act, is the subject of this meeting today. I believe this program looks to the future rather than the past. When I signed the legislation last month, I pledged it would not be another bureaucratic boondoggle but would provide help and bring hope. Our aim is training for up to a million unemployed Americans each year in skills they can use in the private sector. Now, why are we confident this program can succeed when so many others before have failed? Well, the difference is you. This time, you, the private employers of America, will lead, not the Federal Government. The whole idea behind the job-training act is the spirit of new federalism. Private employers will work with Governors and locally elected officials to ensure a proper balance of activity within the States. With your leadership, the States can plan and carry out a training program that spends our resources the way they should be spent on training our people. Too often in the past, the bulk of funds set aside for Government job-training programs has been used to pay bureaucrats, not to help the needy. By embarking at least 70 cents of every program dollar for job training, we can eliminate the bureaucratic waste of the past. No one knows better than private employers the skills today's employees need or how to train them for the sunrise industries that will pioneer products and technologies for tomorrow. Never have we had a greater need for job training in America. So, I am making an appeal: Please do what you do best be leaders and help us make this program work. The Job Training Partnership Act provides you with the opportunity to work locally to explore targeted policies to reduce high youth unemployment. This can include working on ways to improve the transition from school to work, to help those who do not go on to college but who often lack the requisite skills to handle available jobs. Here again, the answer is better training. Not only will this training help the individual, it can reduce the cost to employers of hiring young workers and the long-term unemployed. We must move forward together on other fronts. In September I signed the Export Trading Company Act, which I know the U.S. Chamber strongly supports. This legislation will increase exports and create trade-related jobs by encouraging formation of trading companies. The idea is already being used against us by our principal competitors. With your help, we will even up those odds. We will win back America's reputation as the great Yankee trader. Our administration will also push in the lame-duck session for passage of our enterprise zones initiative. This bill can revive the most impoverished areas of America, provide new incentives to develop business and create jobs. In a time of high unemployment, there is no excuse for further delay on enterprise zones. We must not slam shut the doors of opportunity on those who look to us for help. None of these actions would take us back to the inflationary, make-work programs of the past. But they would help us lower structural unemployment. Still, let us remember the other solution we need, the long-term cure that will make America more competitive, more productive, better equipped to provide good jobs and a higher standard of living for our people. That is the power of investment. Savings finance investment and investment creates growth. But during the last decade in America, we saved and invested at less than half the rate of our major competitors. The investment challenge is America's challenge for the eighties. Our program of tax incentives has begun to correct the savings and investment gap. But the program represents a mere down payments on what needs to be done. America can and must do better. So, let me make something plain: We do not need fewer incentives for people and more spending by government; we need less spending by government and more opportunity for the American people. And that is the direction I intend to go. Practically all the talk in Washington is about what government will do to the taxpayers. Well, it is time we got back to a dialog about what government can do for the taxpayers. We cannot create jobs and reduce projected deficits on the backs of hard-working American families. We must have an agenda of incentives for growth. Growth is the answer for America. You know, the spirit of the American Revolution was born in an idea that remains true for all time. If freedom and opportunity are to flourish, limits must be placed on the size and authority of government. But no limit must be placed on the ability of any man or woman to reach for the stars, to go as far as their God-given talents will take them. We came to Washington to revive the spirit of the American Revolution. Some are saying our work is already done. Well, I would answer, We have barely begun. With your help, we will put the age of inflation behind us and bring a new age of opportunity and progress to America's doorstep. And now, Meryl, I will quit talking long enough to field some questions from your listeners. Thank you. ENTITY, the unemployment rate is presently 10.4 percent. There are over 11,600,000 people out of work. What can a training program do to reduce unemployment when there are so few jobs available? Well, Wally, maybe there are more jobs available than we realize. You know, when I was talking about structural unemployment, I think you should know that in the last couple of years, just 2 years, 3 million of those 11 million unemployed were newcomers into the job market, and there were no jobs available for them. But take a look on any given Sunday to a metropolitan newspaper. I have been doing it here with the Washington papers. I have been doing it with my hometown paper, the Los Angeles Times. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Washington paper had 34 full pages of help wanted ads, and the Los Angeles paper had 52 such pages. This is true in most metropolitan areas on any given Sunday. Now, these are employers advertising for employees. And the reason those jobs are open is because there are not people with the training or experience to fill those jobs. This is why our program is aimed at being implemented at the local level with your help, with business people out there and local officials aiming the jobs or the job training at the jobs that are open in those communities. ENTITY, Willard Carr, chairman of the board and CEO of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and a partner in Gibson, Dunning, Krutcher law firm. ENTITY, the Job Training Partnership Act calls for a much greater involvement of the private sector in employment programs. Do you believe that the private sector will step up to this challenge? Yes, I do, because, as a matter of fact, over a period of time, the private sector has been spending about $30 billion on job training, on-the-job training, as well as other programs of that kind. I know that a number of communities across the country, the private sector has and with, we think, some encouragement from our private initiative sector has started such programs themselves. And what we want to do is simply help. We want to spread the word about successful programs to other communities. And I am convinced that from what I have seen so far the private sector out there is just simply waiting for someone to point a finger in a direction that they can go to further improve things. Good morning, ENTITY. This act has been called a first step in the new federalism, because it gives Governors substantially greater authority. Based on your experience as Governor of California, do you believe States are prepared for this increased responsibility? Yes, I do. And let me tell you why I do. When I was Governor, many of the Federal programs that were sent to us came so encumbered with red tape and specific declarations of how we had to implement those programs that we found there was an ignoring on the part of the Federal Government of what our priorities might be. This is a great, diverse country, and we found that if we had had more say in directing that Federal aid, we not only could have saved money, we could have been more efficient, more effective. I have talked to a mayor not too long ago who was telling about a Federal program that had to do with the handicapped and the buses in his city. And he said the program that was dictated to him by the Federal Government was so expensive that for less money than that, with regard to what he had to do with his buses, he could have afforded to send every handicapped person any place they wanted to go in taxicabs. Yes, we have tried over the years. When I say we, let me change that. The Federal Government over the years, in the past, has tried to reduce the States to mere administrative districts of the Federal Government. But we are a federation of sovereign States, and I am fully confident that at the local and the State level they are better equipped to know what their priorities are and how best to approach them, and that is why we have been changing as rapidly as we can persuade Congress to do it specific grants from the Federal Government to block grants, giving the States that leeway. This is Cissy Musselman, president of the Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce and managing director of Harrison Company, insurance agency. ENTITY, this law provides for training unemployed people. The enterprise zone plan calls for developing jobs in areas where unemployment is highest. Do you expect the enterprise zone legislation to pass the new Congress? Yes, but I could use all your help, Cissy all of you there to let the Congress-know. This has been a long time now, about a year, before the Congress, and it needs to be acted upon. As a matter of fact and this partly answers the previous question also the Governor of Louisiana has stooped waiting for the Federal Government and at the State level has instituted an enterprise zone act or program down there that is working just fine. And this program is one that there is no cost. There are tax incentives involved for both individuals and for business, businesses that will come into those enterprise zones. But those tax incentives are not costing anything either, because right now we are not getting tax from those zones. The local government is not getting property tax, because most of the property there has been taken over by the government for nonpayment of taxes. It is been abandoned. The individuals are not only not paying tax, but most of them are already wards of the government by way of our very many social welfare programs. So, it benefits us to offer these incentives while those people stop being wards of the government, become useful employees and while businesses start up there that otherwise would not come in to take advantage of the available labor and those tax advantages. Good morning, ENTITY, I am chairman-elect of the Chamber of Commerce of New Orleans and the River Region, and I would like to ask you, if I may, whether spending this money on public service employment would not create more jobs and be a better investment of public funds. Mr. McCall, as a former Governor, let me tell you that while there were some programs some of the CETA programs and so forth that served a useful purpose, at a much higher cost I might say, a higher percentage of the dollars in administrative overhead than will be devoted to that in this program. Those programs that I speak of as having served a useful purpose were for the most part the programs that did involve training for the private sector. We found in California, in our experience, that too many of these jobs creating public employment became boondoggles. They just simply padded the rolls of the various levels of government with excess employees. And then if the program came to an end, it was either the local government and the taxpayers who had to then carry, keep on these excess employees, or they had to be dismissed. And they had not been trained, again, for the real jobs with a future that are out there in the private sector. So, no, I do not believe that taking on added employees or training for public service is equal to training people for the jobs that are open and waiting out there for skilled and experienced employees. ENTITY, this is Bill Queenan, president of the Northwestern National Bank in Bloomington, Minnesota, and a vice president of the Bloomington Chamber of Commerce. ENTITY, this act has a program for training displaced workers, those workers who, in many instances, have been laid off because of foreign competition. Do you see this program helping American workers become more productive and better able to compete with workers from other countries? Yes, I do. And incidentally, I cannot resist saying that my first time to ever visit your State was to broadcast an Iowa-Minnesota football game. But, I do believe this, because part of the structural employment problem has to do also with jobs that will not exist for those who have been laid off anymore, that there have been changes in the makeup of work here in our country modernization in certain plants in which the jobs will no longer be necessary. And these workers must be retrained for the other kind of jobs that are coming on line in this changing economy of ours. And, so, that is very definitely an important part of the program and an important responsibility. When I keep saying structural, what I really mean is that if the recession ended tomorrow, there would still be a higher unemployment problem than we have been used to in the past because of the increased influx into the job market of workers, or the percentage of adults who are seeking work, and because of these people whose jobs have just been technologically wiped out. And we must meet that problem, too.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksandquestionandanswersessionduringunitedstateschambercommerce0", "title": "Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session During a United States Chamber of Commerce Teleconference on Job Training Programs", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-and-question-and-answer-session-during-united-states-chamber-commerce-0", "publication_date": "19-11-1982", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 163, "text": "Another big issue in this country right now has to do with the legalization of marijuana. You gave an interview to the New Yorker's David Remnick and you said that you thought smoking pot was a bad habit, but you did not think it was any worse for a person than drinking. Now, that contradicts the official Obama administration policy, both on the website of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and also the fact that marijuana is considered a schedule-one narcotic, along with heroin and ecstasy. Now, do you think you were maybe talking just a little too casually about it with Remnick in the New Yorker, or are you considering not making marijuana a schedule-one narcotic? Well, first of all, what is and is not a schedule-one narcotic is a job for Congress. It is not I think it is the DEA that decides that. It is not something by ourselves that we start changing. No, there are laws under-girding those determinations. Would you support that move? But the broader point, I stand by my belief, based I think on the scientific evidence, that marijuana for casual users, individual users, is subject to abuse, just like alcohol is, and should be treated as a public health problem and challenge. But as I said in the interview, my concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individuals users that have been applied unevenly and, in some cases, with a racial disparity. I think that is a problem. Over the long term, what I believe is if we can deal with some of the criminal penalty issues, then we can really tackle what is a problem, not just for marijuana but also alcohol, also cigarettes, also harder drugs, and that is try to make sure that our kids do not get into these habits in the first place. And you know, the incarceration model that we have taken, particularly around marijuana, does not seem to have produced the kinds of results that we have said. But I do offer a cautionary note, and I said this in the interview. Those who think legalization is a panacea, I think they have to ask themselves some tough questions, too, because if we start having a situation where big corporations with a lot of resources and distribution of marketing arms are suddenly going out there peddling marijuana then the levels of abuse that make take place Are going to be higher. Are going to be higher. When your Director of National Intelligence General James Clapper, testified before Congress and said before the Snowden leaks that there was no mass surveillance going on, a lot of Democrats in the Senate think that he was not honest. He said later that it was the least untruthful answer he could give. I know that you have faith in Clapper. I know that you believe that these programs protect the American people. But I cannot believe that you were not disappointed by his answer because least untruthful is not a phrase I remember hearing on the campaign trail. I think that Jim Clapper himself would acknowledge, and has acknowledged, that he should have been more careful about how he responded. His concern was that he had a classified program that he could not talk about and he was at an open hearing in which he was asked, he was prompted, to disclose a program. And so he felt that he was caught between a rock and a hard place. So you understand what he did? Now, subsequently, I think he is acknowledged that he could've handled it better. He is spoken to Mr. Wyden personally. I think the broader point is that everybody that I have dealt with in our intelligence community is really working hard to try to do a very tough job; protect us when there are constant threat streams coming at us, but doing so in a way that is consistent with the law and consistent with our Constitution, consistent with our privacy rights. I am actually confident that we can continue to have the best intelligence service in the world, but win back the confidence of both the American people as well as folks overseas, but it is going to take some time. It is going to take some work, partly because the technology has just moved so quickly that the discussions that need to be had did not happen fast enough, did not happen on the front end. And you know, I think that we have the opportunity now to move forward in a way that is going to make a difference. A lot of members of Congress, and not just like the fringe ones, the ones who actually are serious lawmakers, have said to CNN that they would not let their family members go to Sochi, that they are not confident that it will be safe. You see all the intelligence. I know that you are not going. I know Michelle and Sasha and Malia are not going. But if close friends of yours or close friends of the girls said, hey, we are thinking about going, what would you tell them? I'd tell them that I believe that Sochi is safe and that there are always some risks in these large international gatherings. I am always going to feel even better if it is inside the United States because then we have full control over what happens, but the Russian authorities understand the stakes here. They understand that there are potential threats that are out there. And we are coordinating with them. We have looked at their plans. I think we have a good sense of the security that they are putting in place to protect not only the athletes themselves but also visitors there. So what I would say is that if you want to go to the Olympics, you should go to the Olympics. And you know, we are not discouraging in any way Americans participating in what is just always an amazing, wonderful event. In these large settings like this, there are always some risks involved and I do not want to completely discount those. But as we have seen here in the United States, you know, the Boston Marathon, I mean, there were some risks if you have lone-wolfs or small cells of folks who are trying to do some damage. Thank you for your time, sir. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Appreciate it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjaketappercnnsnewday", "title": "Interview with Jake Tapper of CNN's New Day", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jake-tapper-cnns-new-day", "publication_date": "31-01-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 467, "text": "Well thank you both so much for joining us today. My hope is that this is more of a conversation than an interview. So we will just let you guys talk. I am going to be obviously jumping in with questions. But we want it to be natural and fun. And I want to start off by saying that you guys have a lot more in common than I am sure a lot of people know. You are both born into multiracial families, you were raised by single mothers. And you have risen to the top of your respective fields as African Americans. Which is pretty notable. But I am curious, what do you see in each other that you recognize in yourself? Like what is it, and is there a common thread that has allowed you both to succeed? Well first of all, I thought you were going to say that I am also a really good dancer. I thought about it. I saw you dancing with a 106-year-old. That is not the common thread. So I was a little let down as you, that was not the common thread that she picked up on. Well first of all, I mean I could not be prouder of what Misty's done You know, as the father of two daughters, one of the things I am always looking for are strong women who are out there who are breaking barriers and doing great stuff. And Misty's a great example of that. Somebody who has entered a field that is very competitive, where the assumptions are that she may not belong. And through sheer force of will and determination and incredible talent and hard work she was able to arrive at the pinnacle of her field. And that is exciting. The other thing is, as a father of two daughters, seeing how images of strong athletic accomplished women carry over, and encouraging them in sports and dance and how they move physically, it turns out that every study shows that young girls who are involved in sports, dance, athletics end up having more confidence generally. And across the board in everything that they do end up being more assertive, happier. So this is one of the reasons why having Misty on our Fitness Council has been so important. I think that there is a sense of humbleness and humility, and there is a human that is within you. And I think that that is something that I can relate to and connect with that people are drawn to. And they feel this genuineness coming from you. And I think that it allows you to rise to this level, and not feel this pressure that is kind of pushing you down, but allows you to take the responsibility with a sense of pride. And again just being grounded. And I feel like as I am embarking on my first season as a principal dancer I am experiencing something that I did not prepare myself for, I think emotionally and mentally and psychologically. When you have all of these expectations and goals to reach this point that 1% get to, you know how do you ? what do you do when you get there? How do you stay grounded and humble and striving? And I think that is on a much smaller scale for me, but something that I feel I can relate to with you that I cannot imagine you must have experienced. Well, you know, it is interesting, this whole notion of when you arrive. I do not know how it felt for you, but certainly for me, you know probably I burst out onto the national scene with the Democratic Convention speech of 2004. And that was the first time that I had a big national audience. And everybody responded really favorably. And so I got a lot of attention and interviews and magazine pieces and all this stuff. And I still remember telling Michelle and my closest friends, I said I am not any smarter today than I was last week, right. In some ways, when you struggle for a while, and you have had the ability of being an ordinary person and you have gone shopping, changed diapers and tried to figure out how to pay the bills and so forth, so that you are not some overnight success. Then handling some of these issues ends up being easier because you have a better sense of perspective. You do not sense somehow that this is because I am just so special, or because I am so much smarter than that other person. Because in fact you have known those other people who are talented and smart and capable. In some ways you got a break, you were lucky. And that, for me at least keeps me grounded because it reminds me that, you know, for all the blessings and privileges and responsibilities that I have gotten, I am just representing a huge cross section of people who are talented and capable and supported me getting to where I came from. So that takes a little bit of the edge off. And more importantly, it means that your friends do not start looking at you and thinking oh, you are acting kind of like you are all that, right. And it is good to have friends who will do that for you. If you start acting weird, they are like -- Check you. Yeah. It is like what, suddenly you are some prima ballerina? Please. I remember when ? and they will remind you of some story. Okay. That is helpful. And you both represent the African American community. As ENTITY of the United States, as a principal dancer for the American Ballet Theater, do you ever think that ? how does race come to play? Do you think that people still treat you differently because of race? Because you are African American? You know, my experience has been that a lot of what I have experienced has not always been to my face, or it is been very subtle. But it is in a way that I know what is going on and I feel it deep inside of me. And I, being the only African American in almost every environment in terms of classical ballet, it weighs on you and it wears on you after a while. And I feel like a lot of it as well is what I am kind of putting on myself. And this just trying to not get too caught up and too wrapped up and too weighed down with being black and trying to just be the best person and the best dancer that I can be. And work, and work harder than, even if I see the person next to me that things may be a little bit easier for them, I am going to try and push myself even harder than them. But I think that being African American has definitely been a huge obstacle for me. But it is also allowed me to have this fire inside of me that I do not know if I would have or have had if I were not in this field. Well part of classical ballet that makes it challenging is that there is a very set way of doing things. There is sort of this canon that people want it just a certain way, or they want it to look a certain way. So do you find now that you are in a position where you can start pushing the barriers a little bit and the boundaries in terms of what people expect? Now that you have established that alright, I can do this, so let me also do that. Or I can master that style, and so now can we introduce something a little bit different? How much of that takes place? Absolutely. I mean I think that having a platform and having a voice to be seen by people beyond the classical ballet world has really been my power I feel. It is allowed me to say, it is okay to have a healthy athletic body. We are fully capable of doing everything that the person who does not have an extremely athletic body, that is more thin. We are fully capable of doing exactly the same thing. And I think that being in this position and showing that I can execute and do all of these things that it is possible to have any skin complexion, to have a healthy body image for the ballerina body. I think it is given me more of a voice. And it is I think forcing a lot of these top tier companies to address the lack of diversity and diversifying the bodies that we are seeing in classical ballet. It is really forcing that conversation to be had. I have to say as an outside, I do not know if you feel the same way. When I hear that like your body type is considered sort of more athletic or large, you are tiny. For those of you who are watching, you may not be able to see. I mean, you are petite. Yes. So the notion that somehow that was even a question is pretty interesting. Yeah, I mean I think it is how ? I think it is a lot of the language and how we use it. And I think for a lot of people of color, that seems to be an easy way or a way out by saying you do not fit in. It may be it is your skin color. It may be the texture of your hair. Whatever it is. We want a certain look. Yeah. And I think that is an easy way of addressing that. Interesting. As a father of two daughters, do you see that at all? Do you see that pressure in your own life? Yeah. I mean some of this is just gender issues, generally. I mean when you are a dad of two daughters you notice more. When I was a kid I did not realize as much, or maybe it was even a part of which is the enormous pressure that young women are placed under in terms of looking a certain way. And being cute in a certain way. And are you wearing the right clothes? And is your hair done the right way. And that pressure I think is historically always been harder on African American women than just about any other women. But it is part and parcel of a broader way in which we socialize and press women to constantly doubt themselves or define themselves in terms of a certain appearance. And so Michelle and I are always guarding against that. And the fact that they have got a tall gorgeous mom who has some curves, and that their father appreciates, I think is helpful. I do think that culture's changing for the younger generation a little bit more. You see Beyonce or you see some of these pop stars and what both white, Latino, black children are seeing as representative of beauty is much broader than it was when I was a kid. You just did not see that much representation. And that is healthy and that is encouraging. But it is still a challenge. I mean Malia will talk about black girl's hair and will have much opinions of that. And she is pretty opinionated about the fact that it costs a lot, it takes a long time, that sometimes girls can be just as tough on each other about how they are supposed to look. And so it is , as a parent, that is a constant learning process that you are trying to hold the fort. And that is why somebody like Misty ends up being so important. A lot of it is the power of that image, even if they are not dancers, even if they are not interested in pursuing a career in entertainment or the arts. For them to know that that is valued end up making a big difference. And beyond the just simply being there, that obviously makes a difference. But then there is also a pressure like you mentioned to do more. And I am curious also what you make of social movements like Black Girl Magic, when there is like these grassroots level reinforcement of these ideas that black is beautiful, in a sense? It is so important for this generation. And to use social media to have a positive impact on our generation is huge. And I know that you have a presence as well. And it is such a part ? I think we have to be involved I think in order to really reach the younger generation on social media. But to have movements like Black Girl Magic, I think it could not be more positive for a young black girl to see that it is okay to be yourself, it is okay to not have to transform and look like what you may see on the cover of a lot of magazines. That you are beautiful, that it is possible to succeed in any field that you want to, looking the way that you do. With your hair the way it is. I think all of that is so extremely important and something that I am constantly celebrating. That something that I fought so hard for throughout the beginning of my career is I did not want to pancake my skin a lighter color to fit into the ... ballet. I wanted to be myself. I did not want to have to wear makeup that made my nose look thinner. There are just ? it is important I think with this generation of young minorities, children especially, to feel comfortable and confident in their skin. Well social media obviously is the way in which young people are receiving information in general. So the power of young activists to help shape color and politics through things like Black Lives Matter, which I think is hugely important. And when I think about the journey I have traveled, there is no doubt that young African America, Latino, Asian, LGBT youth, they have more role models. They have more folks that they can immediately identify with. And that, in and of itself is of value. But what we also have to remember is that the barriers that exist for them to pursue their dreams are deep and structural. And so it is wonderful that the potential dancer can see Misty and say, I can do that. But if there is no dance studio at all in their neighborhood, and if their schools do not offer any extracurricular activities at all, or if their school is chronically underfunded, then it is going to be a problem. I hope that there are young men of color who are looking at me and saying, I can aspire to be ENTITY, or a senator, or a community organizer and make change in my neighborhoods. But if they are locked out of opportunity, and in neighborhoods where even if I am on television, there are no men in their neighborhoods who've got jobs that are able to support a family, then you have still got problems. So I think culture, changing attitudes is hugely important. You know we are for example trying to get more girls and women to study the stem subjects, math, science, engineering. Because they are chronically under-represented. And in researching this we found out that for example, since CSI came on, and there are women who are doing forensic investigations, that the number of women who are in this field has skyrocketed, right. So some of it is just okay, I now picture myself as doing that. But I think it is important for us to remember that it is not just a matter of providing us a strong image, it is also making sure that they have got good schools, making sure that they are getting programs that allow them to explore all their talents. Making sure that the economy is working in a way that gives everybody a chance to succeed. It is a both and rather than an either or proposition. Well how do you make sure those things are protected when you see, for example Affirmative Action in the balance again? Is that something that is important in academics and the arts for example? Well I ? look, I am a strong supporter of Affirmative Action as a way of opening more doors. And I think there are ways of structuring Affirmative Action so that everybody's getting more of a chance. And the truth of the matter is, there is always been Affirmative Action, it just has not always been minority focused, right. If you make a big donation to a university, your kid is more likely to get into the university. It is not called Affirmative Action, it is called legacies. And so for a school, for a dance program, for a political organization to say we are going to actively seek out and recruit talent that has not had insight into this field before, this world before. We are going to have a bunch of young girls come into American Ballet Theater and just watch, and get a workshop, and have them imagine themselves on that stage. You know, because they are much less likely to have a program available to them in their community or to have parents who even know about ballet. Well, that is something that is extraordinarily valuable. And I think we can sustain, while not being so rigid that it ends up locking anybody else out of an opportunity. I absolutely agree. I mean I think it is so completely necessary. Especially when you are dealing with a field that is never really been open to reaching out to communities that do not have the access, that do not have the exposure and the means to be a part of something especially that is so niche as the classical ballet world. And I think that it is a responsibility that I feel. You know, being the only African American at this level in American Ballet Theater, I feel like people are looking at me, and it is my responsibility for me to do whatever I can to provide these opportunities in communities to be able to educate them. And if that means having a program just for black dancers to allow them to have the same opportunity that generations and generations of white dancers have had, it is necessary. Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I have got something called My Brother's Keeper that we have been mobilizing all across the country. And the notion is, if we can reach young men of color, who so often are channeled into destructive behavior or into dropping out of school and ending up in the prison pipeline. If we can just expose them to what their possibilities are, link them with a mentor, work with the institutions like schools to say, examine what your policies are on suspensions and expulsions to make sure that black boys or Hispanic boys are not being treated differently. What you do is to ? what you discover through this process is how much talent is there untapped. And we bring in some mentees to the White House each year. And I have lunch with them and we pair them up with senior advisors. And a lot of them have never even been into an office setting before. A lot of them do not know what it means to be a secret service agent. Or what would be required for them to pursue a professional degree. And we have been doing this for a few years now, and we are already seeing how the horizons that these young men suddenly have for themselves starts rising. And the great thing is we have been able to duplicate this in hundreds of cities across the country. You are seeing companies step up saying we are willing to bring in somebody for the summer so that they can get exposed to what a law firm looks like, or what an accounting firm looks like. And that then provides the motivation for these young people to navigate and take ? make better choices in their own lives. Because ultimately, I am sure Misty feels this, I certainly feel it, we would not have succeeded if we had not worked hard. You cannot replace hard work and initiative and discipline and sacrifice, and delayed gratification. There are all kinds of things you give up along whatever path to success you have chosen. But part of what inspires you to make those sacrifices is the sense that I might actually succeed, you know. And so much of what we want to do with our young people is persuade them to dream big, and to not feel that somehow their circumstances at birth, or the circumstances of their upbringing or poverty or race in any way inhibits them. You have to be honest with them and say yeah, it is going to be harder for you than it might have been for somebody else. But that is okay. It turns out that kids are extraordinarily resilient if they feel like they can actually make something happen. Looking back, was there anything that someone told either of you about race, or did not tell you about race that you wish they had or that you feel like you had to learn on your own? And how does that impact how you talk to young people today? I feel like my mom pretty much covered everything with me. Being biracial she made it very clear to me that yes, you are Italian and you are German and you are black, but you are going to be viewed by the world and by society as a black woman and you should be prepared for that. I think that I, being very shy going into a setting where I was the only black woman, allowed me to observe more, rather than react. And I think that saved me a lot. And it taught me a lot. And it has allowed me to, when I am interacting with my mentees to say to them, you know, there are just ways that you have to approach situations that may be difficult or may not be fair, but it is how you represent yourself. You may be carrying a responsibility that you do not want, but it is what it is being African American and being in certain environments. It does not matter if you are a ballet dancer, if you are an attorney, whatever it is you are trying to do, you are going to be faced with these obstacles. You know, I mean I think about this now as a parent. Michelle and I are having a lot of conversations around the dinner table. And for me, what I always try to transmit to my kids is that issues of race, discrimination, tragic history of slavery and Jim Crow, all those things are real. And you have to understand them and you have to be knowledgeable about them. And recognize that they did not stop overnight. Certainly not just when I was elected. I remember people talking about how somehow this was going to solve all our racial problems. I was not one of those who subscribed to that notion. And, but what I want them to draw from it is a sense of justice for everybody. My view is that the strength of having been a minority on the receiving end of discrimination is that it should make you that much more attuned and empathetic towards anybody who is vulnerable. Towards anybody who is being locked out. So what I say to my kids is use this as something that provides you a particular power to be willing to fight on behalf of what you think is right. And that includes thinking about and being concerned with the struggles that whites have in this society as well. You know part of what I think is sometimes difficult, but I think absolutely necessary for black activists like those who are engaging in some of the protests around Ferguson etc., is to try to also get yourself in the mindset of a police officer who is scared. And who is trying to figure out how to navigate a really challenging job and wants to get home safe. And may make a split second decision. And how are they being trained? And are they being provided enough guidance from their bosses that will steer them in a better direction than the worst direction? That is hard to do because it is easier to just kind of say, be angry and frustrated. And part of what I think successful social movements have involved is having a certain righteous anger about injustices being done to you, but also understanding that people who are on the other side of this, they have got their own history and their own circumstances. And you have to understand that, and you have to recognize that each of us has some good and some bad in is. And that is not an excuse, but what it does do is it gives us an opportunity then to have a conversation and to reach across the divide. And that is not something that always, at a time when so much of communications is sound-bytes and tweets, cable news, it is hard to have that kind of conversation. It is easier I think to just make everything very black and white. But I think that when you look at how social changes happened throughout history, including in our country, it is been because we can project ourselves into the circumstances of other people. And hopefully that is something that Malia and Sasha and her generation is picking up on. And I think they have. And wrapping things up. What do you see as the single greatest fixable obstacle to the success of young people today? The single, wow. I think ? I mean everything that you were saying, being able to have an understanding of yourself and how you fit into society and who you are. But to be empathetic to everyone around you I think is such a powerful thing to hold. To be able to forgive. All of those things I think can strengthen this generation of our youth. I think having a strong sense of self and just knowing who they are and being comfortable with that. Well, you know, I spend most of my time thinking about institutions. And there is no doubt, even though it is a clich? that the single biggest difference we can make is making sure that our kids get a good education. We can do a lot to keep the economy moving forward, we can do a lot to make sure that we are enforcing our nondiscrimination laws. We can do a lot more to open up people's perspective about who belongs where. And press to make sure that we have more women CEOs, and more African American film directors. And more Latino police officers. And all those things are important. But the foundation that all this depends is making sure that on the front end, when these little babies are born and start to get curious about the world and are like sponges, that we are giving them the kind of education and the nurturing that they need. So that they are off to a good start. And that involves an imaginative leap, a moral leap on the part of the society as a whole that says every kid should get a genuine opportunity and we are willing to put money behind it, and we are willing to invest in that to break cycles of poverty. And to reach out and pull kids up, even if they are not born into the best of circumstances. And that is hard to do. Because we are working off of a legacy of hundreds of years of discrimination that gets passed on generationally. If we could decide tomorrow that there was no discrimination, that we had some new drug that everybody took and suddenly nobody would be racially prejudiced. We still have a whole bunch of really poor kids who need help. And that still requires us making investments in them. And that means that all of us, the government, private sector, nonprofits, have to make some sacrifices so that those kids are getting an opportunity. And if you talk to the average person, they embrace that idea. One of the great things about being president is you get to meet people from all walks of life. And ... people are fundamentally good people. And they want to do the right thing. And if you ask them should every child have an opportunity, they will tell you yes. But, if you tell them okay, that may mean we have got to spend more tax dollars to provide them with better schools. And the teachers have to be paid more. And we have to make sure that they have got computer equipment in their schools, and arts and music programs are not a luxury, they are something that helps that child thrive. Then people start saying well, you know, I have got my own bills to pay. And I moved into this good school district and I want to make sure that that school district maintains its advantages. And I am not sure whether the money's going to be well spent. We find all kinds of excuses why we do not actually do it, move that agenda forward. And part of my goal, through things like My Brother's Keeper, part of Michelle's goal to ? an initiative she is got called Let Girls Learn, is to keep on creating more and more avenues where we as a society can have that conversation and actually move forward and do the right thing. If we do that, we are not going to eliminate racism and prejudice entirely in this society. But what we can do is to greatly lessen how much it determines the life chances of people. And that should be our goal. Great. Well thank you both so much for chatting with us. This has been really great. And lastly, did you guys catch the game on Saturday? Is Steph Curry the greatest, or is he just great? Steph Curry is the greatest shooter that I have ever seen. You knew I had an opinion on this. And, and I am having more fun watching him than anybody since Michael Jordan. I was going to ask, is he better than Jordan? He is pretty remarkable. He is not ? even Steph would not necessarily say he is better than Jordan. But he is ? the fact that he is about my size and he is doing what he is doing. And I think the growth has been tremendous, I can imagine where he is going to go. It is, that is a great point. It is rare where you get somebody who is already at the pinnacle and then they take it another notch higher. And he is a wonderful young man. He is a lot of run. Well thank you. It is great to see you.

{"id": 93, "text": "Was there ever a moment when you really thought, No, I am not going to run the second time, and, if so, why? No, I cannot say that. But I believe what I have said so often, that the people let you know whether you should or not. And I just resisted allowing myself to think about it too early. I think campaigns are too long anyway. And I just waited as things went on and doing what had to be done here on the job and finally came to a decision that there was a belief in what we are trying to accomplish here and that I wanted to see if we could not finish it. How about Mrs. Reagan-because ever since you were shot, she has been afraid for you, and she has expressed that in different ways many times. The discussions between the two of you, how difficult was it for her? How difficult were the discussions? What was the substance of those? No, the funny thing is, both of us felt pretty much the same way. Several times, when the thing would come up in talk or articles or conversation or anything and-or something like, should we let this organizational effort go forward even without my being an announced candidate-but we both had the attitude of saying that there would come a time when we would sit down and talk about it. And then there did come a time when we sat down and I When did you do it? When did you sit down? Oh, not too long ago. I'd have to say it was this fall. And there was not any disagreement about it. We both had the feeling that it should be done. Most people are saying this is going to be a close election. Whoever the nominee is for the Democrats, it is going to be a close election. You are an old political pro. Honestly, could you lose this election? ENTITY , Yes, I happen to be someone who-I have never done this, in all the times I have done it, without feeling I am one vote behind. What one, either perception or issue or question or political concern have you at the moment-that one thing, whatever it is, that could lose this election for you? Oh, I do not know that I could pick winning or losing the election on one thing. Frankly, I believe that there have been great misperceptions that have been created about me and this administration, what our positions are and where we stand. The fairness issue, for example-I do not think anything could be farther from the truth about that. You are talking about fairness to whom? The poor? To-yes. The disenfranchised. Yes, and supposed that we rigged our programs and our tax breaks and so forth for the rich and for business. These are absolute falsehoods. Anyone who looks at it, I defy them to go back a long way in some of the tax relief programs, such as Kennedy's tax cut program in the sixties, and you will find that there were more benefits for the top five brackets, the income tax payers, and for business in those bills than there were in ours. But, ENTITY, there are people across this country, the truly needy, the down-and-out, the poor, who look at you, and they say, Yeah, he is the nicest man, and we like him; but his policies are causing misery. They are hurting us. We are hungry. And they do not understand. They say, If he cares that much, why are we hurting? What do you say to them? Dave, I will tell you, what I would like to be able to say to them or have a chance to say to them is that, sure, when someone is down on his luck and is having hard times and they'd like to have someone to blame, they have heard a steady drumbeat. Now, they have been told over and over again that because we are trying to hold down government spending that somehow we are taking it out of their hides. We are spending more on food for the hungry, more on the needy, more on health care than has ever been spent in the history of this country. If there are people that are falling through the cracks when we are spending more than has ever been spent on programs for them, more on food stamps and more people are getting food stamps, then we want to find out. And this was what the commission was to do, to find out why-if this is true that this is widespread, then is this caused by inefficiency at the administrative level, that in the distribution of these programs? Is it caused by people who maybe do not know how or where to apply for them, do not have the knowledge they should have? What is the reason? Well, the commission reported that they did not find it that widespread. What we have found in this country, and maybe we are more aware of it now, is one problem that we have had, even in the best of times, and that is the people who are sleeping on the grates, the homeless who are homeless, you might say, by choice. Now, this has been aggravated somewhat by some things at local or State levels, where there have been changes made in committing people with mental problems to institutions, and they have suddenly been turned out, willing to go. They want out. But they had no place to go. ENTITY, in the interest of time, let me-I want to cover a number of very important points, and I know they are important to you as well, so let us - You ask questions that I have to answer too long. Absolutely. Lebanon. More and more people are saying, Let us get our marines out. Will they be out by election time, by November of this year? Well, as to a timing when they will get out, election time will not have anything to do with that. In other words, there will be no decision made for political expediency. I do not know when they will get out. The mission remains the same. We are studying right now things that we can do to hopefully see that no tragedies of the kind we have had happen again. U.S.-Soviet Relations Let me move to the Soviet Union. You have said for a long time, the only way to negotiate arms reduction is to do somewhat from a position of strength- Yeah. - that the Soviets respect strength. You are rebuilding our military and our defenses at the present time. However, tensions are at their greatest with the Soviet Union since the early sixties. The Soviets have left the negotiating table, and quite frankly, people across this country are more afraid than they have been in many, many years that we might be going to war. How long do the people of our country, right now, have to wait for your philosophy of negotiate from strength to pay off, because right now they are frightened, ENTITY. Well, what they need to find out-and maybe in the campaign ahead we will have an opportunity to tell them-we are not in more danger. We are safer and more secure than we were several years ago. How do you prove it to them? ENTITY , Well- ENTITY, How do you prove it to us? ENTITY, The proof is several years ago the United States had allowed its own defensive strength to decline to the point that you could look and say we were not too far from a point of weakness in which the enemy could be tempted because we did not have the strength. There have been four wars in my lifetime. None of them started because the United States was too strong. Will you make concessions to get the Soviets back to the negotiating table? We have been more flexible. They are the ones who have been adamant. They have not come back when we meet some terms of theirs and say, All right, let us negotiate on this. They have nothing to offer. Now, we are You are saying, no, we will not make further concessions- No. -to get them back to the negotiating table? No. We are saying, We will be at the table; come on back. They made a statement on the START talks. They made one statement about something of-well, they were willing to discuss a certain number of missiles, a certain number of planes, a certain number of missiles and submarines. And we have said, We are ready to talk on that. We'd like to then throw in some limitations on the number of warheads -total warheads, because each missile carries more than one warhead. They have not come back. Deficits. Most people of knowledge say it is the biggest single problem facing the economic free world. You have suggested bipartisanship over in the Congress. Let us take a look at it late this year or sometime next year in '85. Why should people vote for you or anybody in Congress who are willing to put on hold for a year the biggest single problem facing the economic free world today? That is not what we have said, Dave. What we have said to the Congress-we have to submit a budget-and we said something that they first broached. Their leadership, Congressman Jim Wright and others said- They say it is your leadership. They say- No, they said- - you are Why do not you get together with us? They have been saying this all through the fall. Why do not you get together and we start talking about this deficit problem? All right. We have offered to. Now Why not do it now, ENTITY? What? Why not do it now instead of waiting But we are talking now. What we have said is you cannot solve the whole thing in this one year. We have talked about our budgeting and a program that we can agree on that will not be made a political football in the campaign, that they will come and meet with us on some provisions to start this string of deficits on a downward path and then, at the same time, to agree that having started this, as we called it, down payment on that, we then take up the structural problems. Few seconds left. Scale of 1 to 10. Everybody's-every pollster is calling everybody in America and saying, What do you think of Ronald Reagan as President of the United States? What if your phone rang today and they said, Scale of 1 to 10, how good a ENTITY are you? 1 to 10. Well--I think I would answer them that I'd be a lot better President if I had a majority of my own party in both Houses instead of having to buck the opposition in the House of Representatives.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdavidhartmanabcnewsthe1984presidentialelection", "title": "Interview With David Hartman of ABC News on the 1984 Presidential Election", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-david-hartman-abc-news-the-1984-presidential-election", "publication_date": "30-01-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 142, "text": "ENTITY, German-American relations have improved since Angela Merkel became Chancellor. With Silvio Berlusconi being out of office and Tony Blair's days being numbered, has Germany become America's most important pillar in Europe, and would you even use a formula such as partnership and leadership, as your father dubbed the relationship with Helmut Kohl? First, let me say, we had disagreements over Iraq, obviously. But apart from that, I always felt our relationship with Germany was vital and important. Much has been made about the differences between Chancellor Schroeder and myself, and no question, there were differences. But I will tell you that from my perspective, and I think he would say this, is we have tried to work beyond that. There were other issues we had to deal with besides Iraq. So the relationship has been good since I have been ENTITY. Angela Merkel comes into office now at a time where we have gotten that behind us, and we are moving forward. Remember, one of the first decisions I made after 9/11 was to go into Afghanistan, and the Germans supported us on that. So there is -we have worked together, and I do believe that, as I mentioned to you, Germany has got a very important role to play in Europe and in the world. And Angela Merkel is assuming the mantle of leadership, for which I am grateful. From my perspective, I think the ENTITY and the country must maintain a lot of good relations with Europe, since Europe is a-it is vital. It is a vital center of trade, and it is a vital center of exchange, and it is a vital center, I hope, of working together to, kind of, spread common values. But we have got a good relationship. Thank you, sir, for inviting us, for giving us this opportunity. Any time. May I congratulate you, sir, on your recent birthday. I was on the South Lawn there, watching. You were watching me turn 60? No, the Fourth of July, the celebration. Let me ask you something, does that seem old to you, 60? No, not at all, sir. Good, yes. Sir, you are-- The American press corps seems to-makes it seems like it is a very old age-people-how old are you, ENTITY? Sixty-one. See. Everybody knows your medical stats, sir. You are in good condition. Thank you for wishing me a happy birthday. Finally ended. Go ahead. Thank you, sir, for indulging us. I wanted to ask you about the continuing Russian integration. Will there be-- Continuing Russian integration? Integration into the world bodies. Will there be a deal on the WTO negotiations with Russia in St. Petersburg? And also, when do you expect Russia to gain a permanent seat at the financial G-7? First of all, as far as the G-8 goes, from my perspective, Russia is an active participant. President Putin has been there; he speaks; he talks; he acts; he interfaces. Plus, he is hosting it-is hosting this G-8. Secondly, we talked about the WTO negotiations with Russia, and there is-I have presented the letter to the President, which makes it very clear, our position, so that there is no ambiguity about what needs to happen in terms of market access from both-the perspective of both countries. And we will continue to work, see if we cannot get this done. President Putin has got his issues at home; we have got issues here. And that is, we have got to make sure any agreement we strike is a good one. And there is two issues that are very important for-a lot of issues are important, but I would say the two areas where a lot of people will be paying attention to it here in America is, one, on agriculture, we want to make sure that if somebody says they are going to take our products into their country, they will do it. And secondly, the other is intellectual property rights. And that is what a lot of people will be looking at from this perspective. I am sure Vladimir Putin has got pressures on his side too. I do believe it is in our country's interest to have Russia as a member of the WTO. It is been a difficult negotiation, because there is more than one constituency. That is what President Putin has got to understand. One issue-not just satisfying what our trade negotiators think is fair; we have got to make sure we can get it through the Congress. But others are watching as well; other nations are watching the set of negotiations. So hopefully, we can get it done. I am optimistic about it. Thank you. Thank you, ENTITY. Did you watch the game? I watched some of it. ENTITY, the new Italian Government has stated that there are, and I quote the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. D'Alema, evident differences with the U.S., certainly with respect to policies from the previous years. And a decision about whether to stay in Afghanistan will be made in the next few days, and a decision has been made to withdraw completely from Iraq, contrary to what the commitment of the previous Government was. Are you disappointed by that? First of all, I want to thank the Italian people and the Government for their contributions in Iraq. They were there during some of the most difficult times. And the previous Government made a commitment and met its commitment, and we are very grateful for that. The current Government campaigned on not staying in Iraq; that is what they said. So when you win elections, you are supposed to do what you say you do. So I am not surprised. I would hope-and I appreciate the commitments. I would hope they would-toward, for example, training through NATO or reconstruction aid. This is an historic time. And one of the messages I will be sending people at the G-8 is, liberty is universal; the world is better off when there is free societies. We will worry about our own selves, of course, but we have also got to need to worry about others living under the-that may live under the clutches of a tyrant or others who are trying to build a democracy. And we would hope that established democracies would help young democracies grow, and there is all kinds of ways you can do that. There is a difference of opinion, obviously, in certain corners as to whether or not we should have gone into Iraq in the first place. But now that we are there, the hope is that we can work with nations to help build the new democracy. And that is not my appeal; that is the appeal of Prime Minister Maliki and others. So I am confident we can work with the Government, looking forward to it. On Afghanistan, you hope they will stay? Of course I do. It is a new democracy. We will see. Every country gets to make its own mind what to do, but I would hope that those who are weighing whether or not it makes sense to stay or go look at the consequences of failure and realize the great benefits of liberty for the people of Afghanistan. An elected government there-society is changing. It takes hard work. I happen to believe the hard work it takes is necessary for peace. ENTITY. Did I say it right? ENTITY. Yes, see, pretty close. Thank you very much. I have a question on North Korea. Security Council is about to adopt North Korea resolution. The U.S. had vowed to continue diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue. But what kind of measures will you take to get North Korea back to the six-party talks? First of all, I want to thank the Japanese contribution in the Security Council. Secondly, I think there is an interesting new development, that the Japanese have decided to delay tabling the resolution to give the Chinese a chance to go to Pyongyang to have a discussion with the leader in North Korea, with the desire of having them come back to the table. So that is where we are-them being the North Koreans-come back to the table. And that is where we are. And so the Security Council option is always there. But to answer your question, the strategy at this point in time is for the Chinese to travel and to make the claim that it would be in North Korea's interests that they come back to the table and remind them they have already been at the table and they agreed to a Korean Peninsula that is nuclear-weapons free. That is what they have agreed to-they being the North Koreans, along with the United States, the Russians, the South Koreans, the Japanese, and the Chinese. So that is where we are. ENTITY, energy security, 25 percent of Europe's natural gas consumption is satisfied by Russia. In the case of Germany, it is more than one-third. Is Europe, is Germany too energy dependent on Russia, and do you see the ensuing danger that Russia has the means to potentially blackmail Europe? I think each nation or each group of nations has to make their own national security calculations. I can just give you my perspective where the United States is, and you can draw whatever conclusions you want from that. I think we are dependent on oil from, in some cases, unstable parts of the world. And while you may be able to manage your way through the short term, in the long term, eventually, I think that will be a problem for national security purposes here. And therefore, when you talk about energy security, it is part-people say, Well, security is how you guarantee supply. That is one view of security. It is just that supplies can get disrupted sometimes. I view security as diversification away from a particular source of energy that may be the cause of the worry about insecurity in the first place. And so the German Government is going to have to make its decision as to whether or not it makes sense to have a supply- one-third of its supply from a single source. I can tell you this, I have told the American people we will spend billions to put technology in place or achieve technological breakthroughs that will enable future ENTITYs to say, I no longer have to worry about a single source of supply; I no longer have to worry about disruption; I no longer have to worry about politics. And I think the world needs to go there, in my own judgment. I think the whole world would be better off if we are less reliant upon forms of hydrocarbon. Is it possible? Yes, it is possible. We are spending over a billion dollars on hydrogen technologies and research to determine whether or not you can actually drive your automobiles with hydrogen, a byproduct of which is nothing, water. The issue with hydrogen, however, is, one, obviously, the technologies. But it takes a fair amount of power to create the hydrogen. And therefore, the question is, will nations such as ours, and others, be willing to use nuclear power to be able to provide the power to create the hydrogen in the first place? It is a policy choice countries are going to have to make. We are working with India and China, for example, on nuclear power. I think it is in everybody's interest that these new, growing economies have-that the appetite for hydrocarbons in these growing economies is lessened with the advent of nuclear power. I know it is in-it really is in everybody's interest because of the globalization of energy demand. In other words, India demands more; it causes your prices to go up. And so our contribution to trying to deal with energy security is to not only spend money here at home but also to work with developing countries to reduce their appetite for hydrocarbons. And to this end, we are working with Japan and Russia, France, and Great Britain to spend money to come up with a fast breeder reactor program, so that we can reprocess, burn, and reduce the amount of waste, which will hopefully then make the idea of additional civilian nuclear power in other countries more palatable politically. And Russia's potential blackmailing power? That is going to be up to the Europeans to make that decision. That is not an issue we worry about here at home. That is an issue that the European leaders are going to have to work through, particularly at the EU, to make sure that they are not in a position where somebody can change the equation. Obviously, there was-some of my friends who were the leaders in Europe were somewhat concerned about the Ukrainian issue. We expressed our opinion on that very clearly. But the decisionmakers, your leaders, are going to have to make the decision as to whether or not they view the current status as something that they need to diversify away from. And I just laid out some ideas as to how, at least, we are trying to do that. ENTITY. You just gave me an opening there-- Well, I am trying to, ENTITY. I am Mr. Thoughtful, as you know. --by referring to Ukraine, sir. Russia, for years, has been subsidizing its neighbors with energy supplies. President Putin recently suggested that it was to the tune of $3 billion to $5 billion a year. Basically he said, If any new friends of those countries want them to have cheap energy, are they willing to pay? So is this country willing to pay the same amount for cheap gas for Ukraine and Georgia? Well, look, there is a pretty good market. I mean, there is a marketplace. And the definition of price-you can judge whether or not it is fair, given kind of comparable situations elsewhere. ENTITY's point is, if you have got a sole source of supply or a significant sole source of supply, sometimes that source of supply can set the market. And I would think that what most consumers would want was fair, transparent pricing. One way to make sure you have got fair pricing is to have alternative sources of energy so that you are able to make different choices, and that is very difficult, particularly when it comes to natural gas. Gas is a hard product to transport. Gas requires enormous capital investment. Oil can be transferred by cart, by trucks. Gas has to be transferred by pipeline, more or less. Now there is a whole new technology coming, which is liquefied natural gas, so it can be transported by fleet. And so all I would ask is that there be transparency, that there be-that people know fully what the rules are, and that the contracts be open, easy to understand, and honored. And if I may stay with the neighborhood for a second there. You recently hosted the President of Georgia. Why do you think it is in NATO's interest to admit a country with two internal conflicts on its territory? I think it is in the world's interest that there be peaceful resolution of those two internal issues. I also think it is in NATO's interest to welcome countries which adhere to rule of law and marketplace economics, a country that is a democracy, a country which allows for public dissent and free press. I think those are all wonderful values that ought to be incorporated-that NATO-that will benefit NATO, with the incorporation of a country like Georgia. It is not a given that Georgia enters. All I said was that Georgia ought to be-that the way forward into NATO for Georgia ought to be clear, and the road ought to be clearly delineated so that they can then do the things necessary to earn NATO membership. There is some question as to whether or not the United States was committed to this Georgian ascension, at least to be a part of the MAP Program. I think I cleared that up. I think people pretty understand- pretty well understand my position on that now. That is good. Thanks. ENTITY. Yes, ENTITY. So let me ask you something, ENTITY. Was your face painted yesterday? Mine was not , but one of a friend of mine was. But my dog had an Italian flag. Very good. So that created quite an impression. ENTITY, two senior officials of SISMI, the Italian counterintelligence service, have been arrested just recently. ENTITY, I am going to give you a chance to ask another question because I am not going to talk about ongoing cases. If you'd like to come up with another question-- It is an open case. It is open in the sense that today there has been a request from the magistrate for the extradition of 26 CIA-- ENTITY-ENTITY-- In principle, you would-- ENTITY, no, I am not going to talk about the case. You can ask another question, since I cut you off before you were able to ask your full question. You confuse me with the soccer. This is just in fairness. Okay. Gone from Mr. Thoughtful to Mr. Openminded here. Well, ENTITY, you have known Mr. Prodi for a long time, and you have known Mr. Berlusconi; you have known both of them. And how would you assess the personal relationship that you had with Mr. Prodi and with Mr. Berlusconi? Is there a difference how comfortable would you feel with one or the other? I feel very comfortable with both. The first thing that is important is I feel comfortable with the people of Italy. We have got very close ties. And let me just take a step back. What is interesting about our country is that we have got-we have had close ties with a lot of countries. My ranch was settled by Germans. Really? Yes. There is a huge number of Italian Americans, a lot of Russian Americans. You know, Norm Mineta in my Cabinet is a Japanese American. In other words, so when you talk about relations with an ENTITY, you have got to understand that there is a-at least I have, I know my predecessors have connections, close connections with people who have fond-either fond memories and/or great pride in their motherland. And the way I like to define relations is that we have got-that I have got good relations and great respect for the country of Italy. Obviously, people are so different that you have just got to gauge your relationship to meet certain objectives. And our objective with our European friends is to have a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace and is in close concert with the United States. And so I think in this case, Prodi and Berlusconi share that objective, both share the same objective; same in Germany. And so I deal with them differently. They are just different types of people with different backgrounds. But I have known Romano Prodi, particularly since he was the head of the EU. I have worked with him quite a bit. Ask him about the time when I was riding my mountain bike on the beaches of Sea Island, Georgia. I came roaring by as fast as I could. There was Prodi with his head down. I made some kind of noise or something startled him out of his walking shoes, you know.My point is, there he was. He is a guy who I felt comfortable enough roaring by on a mountain bike, three Secret Service agents spewing up sand. I know him. I feel comfortable talking to him. I may-he may not agree with me. But the fundamental question I think you are searching for is, can you still have a good relationship even though you disagree on issues? And the answer is, yes. That is part of life. There is a-look, I am the kind of person, I make decisions; I deal with problems; I want to solve them. And sometimes-and, you know, I make it clear where I stand. And that creates-in the world, people say, Wow, that creates tension. But privately, it does not . That is what you have got to know, that there is a-and I work hard to make sure that I have got good personal relationships with these leaders so we can solve problems. And I am confident that-- Will you see him in-- Prodi? --in St. Petersburg, in a bilateral-- I do not even know. I am not the scheduler, ENTITY. But I will see him. In a bilateral? Well, I will take him aside, just the two of us, if that is -I will take your recommendation for it. When I see him, I will take him aside and congratulate him. I do not know whether or not we are having bilaterals or not. Are we? ENTITY, you want me focused on the big picture. I do not know my schedule. Thank you. All right. ENTITY. ENTITY, U.S.-Japan relations are enjoying a golden age, a so-called golden age, which can be credited to close friendship that you and Prime Minister Koizumi share. On the other hand, Japanese relations with China and South Korea have chilled on Koizumi's watch. So how will you build the U.S.-Japan alliance with the next Prime Minister? And what do you hope to see in his approach to diplomacy towards Asia? First of all, our relations are good. I am not sure any ENTITY and Prime Minister are going to be able to duplicate our trip to Graceland.It is an unbelievable experience, if you think about it. It is really one of the interesting lessons of history, is not it? And what I- I am told these guys are sick of hearing me say this, but I am going to say it anyway- what the ENTITY referred to by these guys are the American people sitting behind-so my dad fought the Japanese. And that is startling to me that his son takes the Prime Minister to Graceland. Something happened. We fought the Germans; now we are very close friends. And what happened was, there is a-liberty took hold, a Japanese-style democracy. That is what we are working on in Afghanistan and Iraq. Those are the stakes, as far as I am concerned. And so we have got a great relationship, and I intend to keep it that way. It is in American interests that we work closely with Japan. It is also in our interests that Japan have got better relations with China and South Korea. And that is going to be up to the Japanese leaders to make the determination of how to do that. I, of course, have said that to Prime Minister Koizumi: We would hope that you would be able to improve relations. It is in our Nation's interest that our friends have good relations with other friends and acquaintances. And so that is going to be an interesting issue as to whether or not that is the case, whether that is a campaign issue in your democracy, whether or not it even matters to the people of Japan. But that is why you have elections. That is why you have decisionmaking in the democratic process, to determine whether that is an important issue. And that is -you know what is interesting about the world in which we live, if the Chinese are able to get the North Koreans back to the table, think about a negotiating arrangement where you have actually got the Japanese and the Chinese and the South Koreans and the Americans and the Russians all sitting down, trying to convince Kim Jong Il to give up his nuclear weapons program. It is pretty remarkable, when you think about it. And it is -and so I happen to believe- and the same thing is remarkable, in some ways, that we are still working very closely together on Iran. Germany has been great on Iran, by the way. Appreciate the Chancellor's strong position. And the reason I bring this up, these are issues which we will solve, and we are more likely to solve them more quickly when we work together to solve them. And it is -to me, it is a very positive development. It is a new framework. It is kind of an interesting-it is an interesting data point in history to know that nations with different backgrounds and at times warring with each other are now working together to deal the common-with the common threats. And it is a threat if the Iranians have a nuclear weapon. It is a threat to world peace. It is a threat to all of us. It is a threat for North Korea to develop a nuclear weapon. It is a very destabilizing event in the Far East. So we are working very closely with each other to get it done. Do you have any worry about the relations between Japan and China? Do I worry about it? Yes. Well, I would hope it would improve, is the best way to put it- hope it would improve. I think it is an important relationship. And I cannot make it improve. That is up to the parties to make it improve. I can say, I hope it improves, to both parties, which I am more than willing to do. Anyway, looking forward to going. Who is going? You are going, Steve ? Tom? Stretch , you going? You are going to be there. ENTITY-- No more questions. That is it? One more? Okay, yes. Great.ENTITY, you were mentioning Germany's role vis-a-vis Iran. Provided that there is no positive Iranian response before the G-8 summit-- I am not sure I accept that yet. Yes, well, let us just give it a try. Well, it is hypothetical, ENTITY. Okay, let us give it a try. What measures-- You can try it. Give me a head's up. [INTERVIEWER1: What measures-what kind of sanctions will the administration strive for? And how do you want to convince Russia and China to come aboard? We spent a lot of time talking about these-more than one issue now, obviously, Russia and China. But part of diplomacy is just constant work, constant dialog, and constant discussion, and remind people that we have declared common goals. The goal on the Korean Peninsula is a nuclear weapons-free peninsula. The goal of the Iranians is no nuclear program. And everybody has got different interests. And so everybody has got different pressures. So diplomacy takes a while. And what you are watching-what the world watches now is diplomacy in action. And we will work very quietly with our friends to work toward a resolution of the issue with the goal of achieving this thing diplomatically, of achieving this issue-success diplomatically but also with the goal of saying, you know, with common voice to, in this case, the Iranians, no weapons program. I am not sure I necessarily accept your hypothesis that something positive is not going to happen. I do not know. But what I am going to tell you is we will react to it if it does not , if something positive does not happen. So far, nothing has happened. On the Iranian side, it is been going on for a long time. Right, but there is a meeting here pretty soon. Wednesday. So you are trusting the Iranians? No, no, no. You are asking me to-you are asking me-you are predicting the outcome of the meeting, and I am saying, I am not predicting the outcome of the meeting. And either way, we will be prepared to react. So there is-- Good try, though, on the hypothetical question. Very briefly. Yes, ENTITY. The Russians got their Usama bin Laden, Shamil Basayev, who was responsible for killing the children in Beslan. What do you have to say to the Russians about that? And also, will you be discussing with President Putin his new idea about the new binding treaty to replace the old START I that expires? I will be talking to him about a variety of subjects. Yes, looking forward to hearing from that. And I guess we are gathering the details on the death of the guy, to find out more about it, you know. But if he is , in fact, the person that ordered the killing of children in Beslan, he deserved it. ENTITY, on the U.N.-United Nations, after Kofi Annan-- It is an interesting thing about terrorists, by the way, they will kill children like that. They do not care. The name surfaced recently of Prince Zeid, who is a member of the royal family of Jordan-was the representative of Jordan to the U.N. And he would be the first Muslim in case he would run for it. You are trying to rope me into the-- No, I am saying, would you be against a moderate Muslim? You are trying to get me to commit a name, actually talk about names. No, no, no. In general. As I understand it, the- traditionally, there is kind of a-regions rotate, and we are really looking in the Far East right now to be the Secretary-General-Secretary-General there. Holland. Oh, sorry. Well, that is kind of where the current-that is kind of where the current-he is over 60. No, he is not-53? Fifty-one. Fifty-one. That is kind of- his birthday was recently. That is kind of- so the discussions mainly, at least the ones I have heard about this, somebody from the eastern-Far East-- Asia. Asia, yes. So this is the first I have heard of this suggestion. And you will find that we will work closely with friends and allies to come up with the best candidate, but we will not be committing publicly, like you are trying to get me to do. But with general principle, will you be against a Muslim, in Indonesia, for example, who is up for the position? Not at all, would not be against a Muslim. The criterion I am for is somebody who wants to spread liberty and enhance the peace, do difficult things like confront tyranny, worry about the human condition, blow the whistle on human rights violations. Yes, sir. Final question now, for certain. roped me into another round there. Going back to North Korea, do you still think U.S. can deal with Kim Jong Il in resolving the crisis, or do you have sort of regime change in mind? What we want is for the North Korean leader to give up his weapons programs. And the United States tried to deal with him bilaterally in the past, and it did not work. So I changed the policy. I said it is not going to be just the United States dealing with the North Korean leader. We are also going to have other partners like Japan and South Korea and Russia and China. See, in the past, negotiators from the United States sat down and said this, that, and the other, and the North Koreans did not honor the agreement. So I am trying a different approach. My last approach did not work, so hopefully, this approach will work. And I think it is more likely to work because you have got more than just one person saying it-you know, Get rid of your weapons programs. Now we have got neighbors saying the same thing. And so that is where we are right now. What is interesting, I thought, was that, you know, the Chinese, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, Russia all said, Do not fire your weapon; do not fire your rockets. And he fired his rockets. And that ought to be an interesting lesson to all of us involved in this relationship, that we have got to stay very close together and speak with one voice, because it is very-he must hear clearly that that kind of behavior is unacceptable. People have asked me, what do I think he is trying to achieve? I do not know. It is a nontransparent society. It is hard to tell. Like, if I were to make a decision, you'd be reading about it. People, reporters all over the place trying to- Why did he do this; why did he do that? And that is good. That is what an open society does. I do not know what objective he was trying to achieve. But from my perspective, it sent a signal that he really was not afraid of isolating himself even further. My attitude is, is that the people of North Korea can have a much better life than they have -than their leader has chosen for them. There is tremendous starvation in North Korea. There is huge concentration camps. It is unacceptable behavior, as far as I am concerned. And I would hope that the North Korean leader would choose a different path forward. And the way to do that is to get rid of your weapons programs in a verifiable fashion. There is a better way forward for the Iranian leadership than isolation, and that is to get rid of the weapons programs in a verifiable fashion. It is their choice to make. We have made our-the United States has made its choice; Germany has made its choice; Russia has made her choice; Japan has made its choice. We have made our choice; the choice is theirs. And I would hope that these leaders would recognize that there is-there is benefits for their people. They truly care about their people. There is benefits for their people. You know, one of the most moving moments of my Presidency came when the young-when the mother of-young daughter was kidnaped by the North Koreans. Imagine. Anybody got children here? Imagine if some foreign nation ordered your child to be kidnaped, just removed. And never-they never heard from the girl again. They went-she was telling me, she was wondering whether she was murdered, and they searched everywhere. It is unbelievable, is not it? It turns out that they believe that she was in North Korea, a regime that just felt like there was no accountability and no regard for human rights and just took this young child. So the mother was sitting there in the Oval Office with me. It was incredibly emotional. After all these years, she still felt this pain in her heart. And my point is, is that there is a better way forward than that, to live in a society like that. And the choice is his to make, in North Korea's case. I hope he makes the right choice. It is important for all of us to continue to make that very clear. If he chooses the other way, he will be isolated and his people will not benefit. Okay. Thank you all.

{"id": 393, "text": "Well, it is no longer news. I have heard that before. Well, it is a good answer. Shall we begin? Thank you very much for giving us this time. Well, pleased to do it-sorry we have kept you waiting. No problem. The first question we'd like to ask you, ENTITY, is one that we have asked the Democratic Presidential candidates, and that is: What do you think is the most important problem facing the United States in the next decade, and what ideas do you have for dealing with it? Well, I think the problem remains-and it is a group of problems-and that is maintaining and continuing this expansion of our economy, so that we can provide jobs with a future and opportunity for all of our people. I think it is the problem of achieving a lasting peace, with the reduction, particularly, of nuclear weapons in the world, to reduce and, hopefully, one day eliminate that threat that hangs over us. I think others-to help, as we can, those nations that are trying to establish democracies and become working members of the family of nations. And, I believe, the restoration of some traditional values of family and neighborhood. The distortion that is occurred down through the last few decades of the relationship within our own country of our different levels of government, and to restore authority and autonomy to those levels where the Federal Government has assumed too much of it. I will probably think of several more answers to that later, but- Okay. -but right now, I think that is covered basically: the economy, the economic expansion that is needed and that we have embarked on, and peace in the world and reduction of the tensions and the armaments. Sir, on the deficit question, I noticed yesterday you joked slightly about it and then emphasized how seriously you take the deficit problem. Could you be more specific? How serious a problem is it, and what would you do to deal with it? Well, that would be a part of the overall generic answer that I gave about the economy. Yes, the deficit is a problem; no one can ignore it. But it is been going on for some 50 years, and for most of that time, almost totally in that time, it has been a deliberate part of government policy. And some of us who complained about it back through the years always said that it would get literally out of control, that you could not go on that way without coming to a day of reckoning. And we now are at that day of reckoning. I think the basic part of that deficit is due to government itself and the excessive share of the people's earnings, the gross national product that the government is taking. And so, we are going to continue. We have made a proposal for a down payment over the next 3 years that is pretty evenly divided between some revenues, not by raising rates, but by eliminating some tax practices that we think are not fairly distributed. And that, of course, is part of this temporary down payment. But at the same time, I have ordered the Treasury Department to embark on a study of the entire tax structure-as to how we can collect the uncollected tax that is being evaded by people who owe it and do not pay, simplify the tax structure, broaden the base, hopefully reduce the rates on individuals. You-excuse me-you had mentioned last week in passing that you saw the need at some point to restructure social security for new workers coming into the program. Could you elaborate on that? Well, I think we have to-we have got to look at the whole governmental structure, and this includes the entitlement programs. There have been demographic changes that have been ignored that make some policies now leading inevitably toward another day of reckoning if we do not reorder those programs. About half of your deficit has been structural. About half of your deficit has been cyclical, the result of the recessions. And we are eliminating that half-the cyclical-by the recovery that has taken place. An evidence of that is that just between August and the first of the year our own projections of the deficit were reduced by $15 billion, because we obtained that much more tax revenue than we had anticipated due to the recovery in the economy. ENTITY, on the entitlements, can you be more specific about how this restructuring-it is a year in which you are asking voters to return you to office. Cannot you be more specific about what you would do for medicare and social security? No, not really, because this is something that is going to require thorough study to ensure that you do not pull the rug out from under anyone who is presently dependent on those programs. They must not be frightened as they have been by political demagoguery as they were in the '82 campaign, when our opponents took advantage of the fact that social security-the program was facing, and by our date as of July 1983-facing outright bankruptcy. And they denied this. And then they waged a political campaign that we were out-in some way we intended to take the payments-either reduce them or take them away from people dependent on them. And they caused panic among people who were in a-the senior citizens that are not in a position to defend themselves against this when someone says, Oh, did you know that they are going to do this or this or that to you? But you could be more specific- Well.- -and put some of these fears to rest, could not you? Well, I had tried-and everyone seemed to ignore it-I have said over and over again in talking about social security's problem, that nothing must be done to penalize those people who are now dependent on those checks. But what we need to do is a revamping of the program. We finally, then, when the election was over and the demagoguery stopped- Yeah. -then our opponents agreed to a bipartisan get-together to find an answer to the immediate problem. But is not it risky now in an election year for you to say that we should revamp and restructure these programs without being specific? No. As long as they understand-and as long as you will print that what I said-that there is no intention on the part of anyone of taking away from those people now getting. And maybe also it would be well if you printed that the rebuttal to the demagoguery of the '82 campaign is the fact that today the average couple, married couple on social security is getting $180 a month more than they were getting before we came here. So, these are our goals and our purposes. But there is no way to answer until you have gone into a study of the whole actuarial situation. Now, I read in one of the interviews with one of the present candidates of the other party, where he was claiming that, Well, there is no problem with social security at all because it is safe till the end of the century. Well, 1984 is not too far away from the end of the century. Well, how can he so carelessly dismiss the fact that those same people out there, who, as you have said, can be frightened if someone is saying to them, Yes, the program's going to run into another financial bind, but he does not offer any suggestion for solving it. I am saying that what we must do now is more of what we did in that temporary fix- Right. -is a bipartisan facing up to the fact that you ensure that those people are going to get their payments. But let me take one more pass at this. Do you think, then, in a second term, should you win reelection, that you will want to take another look at these structural problems in social security, as well as medicare? As long as it is in the context that we are not going to pull the rug out from anyone who is presently dependent on those programs. Okay. May I ask you a question about the, what you mentioned a moment ago, about broadening the tax base, as being an objective in your tax simplification study? Would you accept a tax simplification that does lead to an, in effect, an increased tax burden on Americans? Or would your goal be to keep the tax burden the same as it is now? I am looking for a program that can bring about simplification, but I see no need to increase the burden on individuals. This is what-we set out to reduce that- Right. -and simplification-what we are looking toward, and I cannot answer now, because this is a study that has to be made, and it is a very complex subject-when you say broaden the tax base, again, you are talking about involving, in the payment of taxes, people now who, for one reason or the other, have been able to, in many instances, remain totally tax free or remain well below what they should be paying. And thus it limits your ability to reduce the overall burden on individuals by tax rate cuts because of the lost revenue which, right now, is estimated around a hundred billion dollars a year. Is that what you are basically after, the lost revenue, or would you, in effect, net more with a simplification program? That is - Well, when you look at a simplification program you are also looking at a way of making it impossible for those who are presently evading, to evade. When you say evading, you do not mean evading illegally; you mean from unfair tax breaks, as well, right? Oh, no. An awful lot of outright evading. But in addition to that, you are also talking about loopholes, tax breaks, whatever you want to call it. I hesitate-I will not answer that now, as to what all will be in the study. We are, as I said before, in our present proposal, we are changing some that we believe-while they were undoubtedly well-intentioned, they have led to some taking an-getting an advantage that is denied to others. Where that is true, then that should be corrected, whether you have a deficit or- Right, -have a tax reform or not. On the subject of defense spending, sir, you have accepted a reduction this time around in the budget fight, in the rate of defense growth. We wanted to know whether that is a real reduction, or are you just stretching it out? In other words, you'd have the same buildup at the same cost over a longer period of time. Well, obviously, to have such a-to be able to make such a reduction as we did involves some elements of stretching it out, which means that over a longer period of time the same amount of money is distributed so that you have people taking a longer time with their taxes to pay for it. But the defense budget is not determined by how much you want to spend. It is determined by what is necessary to guarantee our security and thus the ability to preserve the peace. And for those who approach the budget from the standpoint of, Well, let us make it this percentage of the budget or let us cut this amount of money, how do you have national security on that basis? Everything that you are going to cut from the defense budget, you have to say, Does this reduce to an unacceptable point our ability to preserve our security or not? And if it does, then you cannot make that cut. If you can delay, if you can postpone some things and you look and say, Well, in looking at the potential adversaries in the world, what emergencies might arise, this is not an unacceptable risk -we can do this, particularly when it is to help bring about the economic strengthening. Now, we have been doing this, and we have-we ourselves, with all of the talk about defense spending as being the source of added funds for reducing the deficit-and I have seen the terms used many times in the media that- record defense spending. It is record if you take the number of dollars without regard to the value of those dollars. It is far below any record at all. There is no hint of such a thing if you take it as a percentage of the budget or as a percentage of gross national product. And in either one of those ratings, our defense spending is far below what was customary back through the years. In the Kennedy era, 1962, I believe it was, the defense budget was about 47.8 percent of the total budget. It is down around 27 percent or so now of the budget. It is a smaller percentage of the gross national product than it was then. So, we think that we are really tightening our belt to make this reduction that we are proposing. Now, how do you arrive at lower defense spending ever? You arrive at it by the other thing that we are trying to bring about, and that is a reduction in armaments with those who could be considered possible adversaries. Then, if you have a reduction of the threat, you can have a reduction of the deterrent on our side. And that is a road toward lesser defense spending. We'd like to move on to that subject, but before I ask you about that, let me just ask once more if it is correct to assume that you see this reduction in the rate of growth that has been accepted now as primarily a postponement of the buildup, a deferral of the buildup, or do you see it as causing any elimination of anything that you had in mind? Not in the sense of weapons systems or reducing manpower. There are-let me be honest and say this whole thing is definitely not all postponement. We have been working and, as a matter of fact, had made $16 billion cut in the defense budget ourselves before we even, then, took this further step. But much of that was based on the things that we, ourselves, have been discovering, as we have in every other area of government, of government practices that could be changed. Some of that spending cut reflects the findings of the Grace commission that we are now implementing. All of this thing that you all have had such a field day with, with regard to wrenches costing thousands of dollars and bolts costing $4 1/2 when they should cost 4 cents and so forth-no one has published those are our figures. We found that that was going on, and we are the ones who have changed that. And already the savings are at hundreds of millions of dollars of rebates that have come back to us, to say nothing of the future savings now of correcting that practice. And there have been indictments, hundreds of them, for fraud and things of that kind. Incidentally, how much of a shock was that for you. What? How much of a shock was that for you to discover the amount of conniving that defense contractors might attempt? Well, it had to be quite a shock, when you first came up with a finding of some little gizmo that you could buy in a store off the shelf for about a tenth or less of what we were paying for it. Do not you wish you could have had some of those when you were campaigning? Yes--yes. May I ask you about the East-West tensions, which you raised or mentioned a moment ago? Are there no further steps that the United States can take unilaterally, now, to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union or to persuade them to return to the negotiating table? For instance, submitting the threshold test ban treaty for ratification, which, I think, is on their list. We are in conversations with the Soviet Union on a number of things of this kind. And on things like-we will soon be talking about a chemical warfare treaty-and with regard to their position, I think the tensions are, frankly, more evident in rhetoric than they are in actuality. I think that there is less tension today and less threat and danger with the rebuilding that we have done that makes us more secure than there was earlier when our defenses were so lax that there was a window of vulnerability. No, we-and they have agreed now to come back into negotiations on one of the three treaties that they walked out on, the conventional weapons treaty, the multiple balanced force MBFR treaty. We are hopeful that they will come back in the others. We have made it plain that we are flexible, that while we have made a proposal, we have evidenced our willingness to negotiate in what may be differing views of theirs. An example of that in the intermediate-range weapons in Europe: My first proposal was-and I think it was a commonsense proposal-and that was zero on both sides, eliminate them all, and that type of weapon. Well, the Soviets would not hear of that. We said all right, then, granted that would be our goal-and we think it is a good goal-but we are willing, then, to talk whatever reduction in numbers that we can make that will be verifiable, that will be fair and even for both sides. And that still remains on the table. But the administration seems to have taken the position now that no new revisions or new revised proposals will be offered until they come to the negotiating table, and then you might have something. Is that a correct description? No, what we are saying is we are not going to sit here and negotiate with ourselves and while they sit out there not participating- Right. -waiting to see what we will finally come up with. That would be very poor negotiating strategy. We have said to them, we are flexible. We are willing to negotiate fair and verifiable agreements when they are ready to come back to the table. Do you think that by not negotiating or not going back to the table the Russians might be trying to influence the outcome of the American election? Oh, I do not think someone could rule that out. I am not going to make the charge, but I am not going to also guess at what might be their-part of their problems might simply be with the change now in leadership, that they are in a period of putting their shop together. On an informal level, do you have a better reading of the new leader there, or have you been in touch with him in some way, in some oblique way-Chernenko? Well the Vice President had an opportunity to meet with him when he was there. And, as I say, there is communication between our two governments, and we remain optimistic that we can arrive at agreements. In the first place, we want them, and they need them. Frank, do you want to ask about the Middle East- The Middle East. In the last year it would seem that the Government-the United States Government might have misjudged the stability of Lebanon and the Lebanese Government and the effectiveness of its army and the willingness of Syria to cooperate with some of our stratagems. Are you satisfied with the basic information you have gotten on what-that was the underpinning for your strategy there? Were you misinformed in the first place or what? No, we knew that what we were attempting to help with was a very complex and complicated problem. And what we and our allies joined together to do was based on the necessity for a withdrawal of the foreign forces that were in there. Remember that when this all started, Israel, because of the violations of its own northern border by the Palestinians, the PLO, had gone all the way to Beirut. War was being fought in the city streets there with the PLO. Casualties among civilians were probably exceeding those of the military. The Syrians, they were also on Lebanese soil. And we went in to help bring about the removal of the PLO, who felt that any effort to surrender could result in a massacre, and they were-some ten to fifteen thousand were removed from the country. Syria had indicated that it, too, would leave, the Israelis would leave, and then Syria changed its mind. That was unanticipated. But even so, the purpose of the troops of Italy, the United Kingdom, France, and ourselves were there to more or less help maintain order while a government, a viable government of Lebanon was created and then to help train-which we did-their army to then go out and occupy the areas occupied by foreign forces-Syria and Israel-as they withdrew, because, also, in those areas were the militias, the unofficial armies that had been fighting each other and fighting the government, such as it was, in Lebanon. Now, for quite some time, progress was made. And I still have to say right now the progress, the meetings that have taken place in Switzerland would not have taken place had all of us not done what we did. It is true that when Syria balked and began supporting some of the rebel elements-but our whole idea was that for Libya-or for Lebanon to have a government, they were going to have to make peace with those militias and find some kind of a broad-based government. And they have set out and they have tried to do that. It did not succeed. But the very fact that all of us began to be subject to terrorist attacks and change the basing of our troops-us putting them on ships offshore and so forth-actually was evidence of the fact that we were succeeding. And those who did not want success knew that one of the steps in having their way was to force the withdrawal of our own forces. Was the level of success, as you describe it, worth the price that we paid, the dead marines? I do not know how you answer this thing that is becoming worldwide now, the terrorist method of suicide attacks and so forth. I'd like to say that there is no cause that is worth the life of any man, but we know that is not true. We did not succeed in what we thought could have gone forward. There has not been-they are still working at it there, the Lebanese Government. One thing, also: We did a good job of training their military and equipping it. What we could not anticipate then was at the instigation of Syria, on ethnic and religious bases, some of the elements of that trained army then refused to perform against the radical forces that the army had been trained to handle. But that does not change the need for us to continue in the Middle East overall with what must take place. And we hope if we can be helpful that we can bring about, and that is a meeting of the moderate Arab States and Israel and the bringing about of peace just as Egypt and Israel brought about peace. If the circumstances were the same, but, hypothetically, we were back 4 years and you were running against President Carter, would not you be hammering him for the death of the marines in Beirut? For what? For the death of the marines in the Beirut massacre. No, if I had all the knowledge that I presently have about the situation. There was one thing, whether it was campaigning or just making speeches in the past that I have always recognized, and that is that there are a number of areas in which only a President has the information, all the information, on a situation. And those who criticize are criticizing without having access to that same information. Well, how about two more? Would you-a quick one-would you veto the bill requiring the United States Embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? I am hoping I will not have to, but like the several previous Presidents before me, I think that that is a most unwise thing. It should never have been introduced in our Congress. The effort should never have been made, because if we are to have a negotiated peace that will end once and for all the literally-well, the hostility between the Arab world and Israel, then that would be one of the things that must be negotiated. The place of Jerusalem, the West Bank, things of this kind-these are all the matters that must be negotiated between these forces. And the United States has no right to put itself in a position of trying to lean one way or the other on those areas for negotiation. Why do not -I'd like to ask the final question about Central America, ENTITY. I wonder if I could ask you to explain or justify how the United States can go about assisting people who are, as you have called them, freedom fighters who are seeking to overthrow a government that we have diplomatic relations with, and answer, if you could, critics who are worried that this is increasing our involvement in Central America. Well, the answer to that is, first of all, this particular government of Nicaragua's is a government that was set up by force of arms. The people have never chosen it. It is a revolutionary government. And that government, in violation of its pledge to us at a time when it was a revolutionary force trying to become a government, had promised that it would not aid the guerrillas in El Salvador, who are attempting to overthrow a duly elected government and a democratic government. And they have violated that. The guerrillas are literally being directed from bases near Managua. They are being supplied by that government. And the other factor with regard-and why I have referred to them on occasion as freedom fighters is because many of them are elements of the same revolution that put the Sandinista government in force. The revolution against the Somoza dictatorship-and our government, under the previous administration, sat back and never lifted a finger in behalf of Somoza and then, when the fighting was over, did start to give financial aid to the revolutionary government to help it install itself-and had to cancel that when it discovered what that government was doing. During the revolution against Somoza, the revolutionaries appealed to the Organization of American States-of which we are a member also-and appealed to that organization to ask Somoza to step down and end the bloodshed. And the Organization of American States asked for a statement of what were the goals of the revolution. And they were provided: democracy, a pluralistic government, free elections, free labor unions, freedom of the press, human rights observed-those were the goals of the revolution, submitted in writing to the Organization of American States. After they got in, they followed the pattern that was followed by Castro in Cuba. Those other elements 'that were not Sandinista, other groups who wanted-and they thought all the same thing, democracy-to rid themselves of a dictatorship. Those elements were denied participation in the government. Arrests were made. There were some who were exiled. There were some, I am afraid, were executed. And many of the people now fighting as so-called contras are elements of the revolution. And it is less an overthrow that they are fighting for as it is a demand that they be allowed to participate in the government and that the government keep its promises as to what it had intended for the people. And I see no dichotomy in our supporting the Government, the democratic Government of El Salvador, and the contras here. And we have made it plain to Nicaragua-made it very plain that this will stop when they keep their promise and restore a democratic rule and have elections. Now, they have finally been pressured; the pressure's led to them saying they will have an election. I think they have scheduled it for next November. But there is not anything yet to indicate that that election will be anything but the kind of rubber-stamp that we see in any totalitarian government. How do you have-there are not any rival candidates; there are not any rival parties. And how would they campaign without a free press? Well, that is a good note for us to close on.

{"id": 161, "text": "ENTITY, in your speech at American University yesterday, you called this the most important foreign policy debate that we have witnessed since the Iraq War. I think if you talk to most Americans, and particularly our generation, they do not necessarily feel that. I wonder why you think that is? Well, I lived through the debate of the Iraq War. I was not yet in the United States Senate. I was a state senator in Illinois. And at the time, there was a drumbeat that going into Iraq was the right thing to do. And a lot of people did not get engaged in that debate then either. It was only after the decision was made. It was only after the initial push into Baghdad descended into massive chaos that suddenly the country realized that we had made a big, strategic mistake. And my point is that now is the time to have the debate, not after decisions are made. In this situation, we have long had a key objective in our Middle East policy. And this has not just been me, but Republican and Democratic presidents, as well as members of Congress alike, and that is that it would be very dangerous for Iran to possess a nuclear weapon. And the deal that we negotiated after years of tough sanctions, after mobilizing the entire world community, prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And Congress now is in a position in which they can approve or disapprove of the deal. The overwhelming majority of experts nuclear scientists, people who are expert on Iran support this deal because they understand that by making sure Iran does not have a nuclear weapon, we will not have to worry about a lot of other countries in the region trying to keep up and get their own nuclear weapon. We will still have problems with Iran on a whole range of issues, but, the alternative to a negotiated agreement of the sort that we put together is, at some point, us having to potentially take a military strike against Iran. That triggers potentially yet another war in the Middle East at a time when we are already trying to fight ISIL. We are already trying to deal with destabilized countries like Yemen and Libya. And we could get drawn further into a maelstrom that is very hard to get out of. We took a lot of questions from our audience ahead of this interview and I want you to start by watching one from a young woman in Iran. OK. So I can just press my button here? Press the Which? Which should I press? the video on the left. The video on the left. This one right here? Yeah, that is it. There we go. OK. ENTITY, you always speak of peace and you made it. But we, the Iranian people, paid a high price because you put very harsh sanctions on us. Do not you think you had other ways to make this deal without hurting Iranian people so much? Well, unfortunately we did not have a better way of doing this. We had, when I came into office, sent a message to the Supreme Leader of Iran indicating that we were prepared to negotiate a deal that would provide the international community assurances they were not developing a nuclear weapon. There was no response. Instead, what we discovered was a covert facility for enriching uranium at a place called Fordo. And in that circumstance, what we had to do was to more severely enforce sanctions so that Iran had greater incentive to come to the table and negotiate. Now the good news is that under this deal, if Iran abides by the agreement, if they get rid of their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and they shut down or modify a number of the facilities they already have and they subject themselves to inspections so that we are sure that they are not developing a nuclear weapon, then the sanctions come down. And our hope is that the Iranian people are going to be benefiting from that. But until that happens, this was the only way for us to be able to get the Iranian government to take seriously the concerns of the international community. You know, 60% of Iran's population is under 30. And, you know, all they have really ever known is living under crippling sanctions and tensions with the U.S. Today's 20-somethings will be 40-somethings as this deal runs its course and will be in positions of power. And so I wonder knowing that the future leader of Iran could be in our audience right now what you would say just in terms of, you know, what is possible in the future of the U.S.-Iran relations as a result of this deal? Well, you know, I tend to be very modest in my expectations short term. I think that if Iran abides by this deal if Congress reads the deal, focuses on it, and then does the right thing, which is to support it then there will be at least a decade, decade and a half in which the sanctions have come down and Iran is able to focus on its economy, the world can be assured that Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon. In that space then there are a whole bunch of broader questions about Iran's relationship to the rest of the world. I have said many times that Iran is an extraordinarily gifted country. It is an ancient culture. It has incredibly smart and talented people. And I wish those people well. There is going to have to be a transition inside of Iran, even if gradual, in which there is a recognition that chanting death to America or denying the Holocaust among its leaders or threatening Israel with destruction or, you know, providing arms to Hezbollah, which is on the terrorist list that those things make Iran a pariah in the eyes of a large part of the world. And I can guarantee you that the moment the Iranian regime stopped engaging in that kind of rhetoric and that kind of behavior that Iran would just by virtue of its size, talent, resources, immediately rise in its influence and its power in the eyes of the world. And that is what I hope can happen. It will require a shift in the politics and the leadership of Iran a different mindset in terms of how they are approaching the rest of the world and how they are approaching countries like the United States. And perhaps, it'll be this new generation that is able to make that happen. Great. We have got another video question for you from an Iranian-American, dual citizen. I'd like to know if you believe that this deal can lead to a shift in the internal politics in Iran and bring about positive reforms there. And if so, is this deal going to be at the cost of our relationships with current allies in the Middle East. Well, as I just said, I try to be modest about this. This deal is a good deal regardless of whether the character of the current Iranian regime changes. As long as they are sticking with the deal, we are solving a big problem, which is Iran not having a nuclear weapon and not triggering a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It is possible that as a consequence of sanctions coming down, more commerce, more trade, more Iranian young people and professionals traveling overseas that some of the suspicions and barriers come down, but it is not automatic. That will depend, I think, on the nature of events inside of Iran. There is great suspicion of this deal among some of our closest allies, Israel in particular, but also some of the Gulf States, who have seen Iran's actions trying to destabilize their governments or sponsoring terrorist proxies. And what I am convinced of is that this deal is a good deal even as we work with those allies to constrain Iranian actions in some of these other areas. But what I can also say for certain is that if Iran started behaving differently, if it was not sponsoring terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, if it was not destabilizing its neighbors, that would be welcomed by those neighbors. And you could see a greater understanding and peace in the region because part of the problem that we have seen emerging in the Middle East is a lot of sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni. And Iran, as the largest Shia state, if it is got a better relationship with Sunni majority states like Saudi Arabia, they, in fact, can have a useful influence on the region. And as a consequence, that makes our fight against ISIL, for example, much easier, because we want to make sure that everyone recognizes that the kind of virulent extremism that we have seen emerging in places like Syria and Iraq and groups like ISIL that is a threat to everybody, that is a threat to all states and we should be unified in fighting that. Speaking of Israel, we have another question from a young man in Tel Aviv. As an Israeli citizen, it is very obvious that you oppose our prime minister. You have made a lot of promises in regards to our security as a people and as you know Hamas is right now basically at our doorstep. Why should we, as the Israeli people, trust you? Well, as president, I have not only pledged and committed to make sure that America supports Israel's security. But I have also provided more intelligence and military cooperation with Israel than any previous president. This administration has done everything that Israel has been looking for with respect to, for example, a program called Iron Dome that has been able to shoot down missiles before they hit Israeli soil and undoubtedly saved Israeli lives. I think it is important for Sam to understand, I do not oppose the Israeli prime minister across the board. We have a strong disagreement about whether or not it makes sense for us to take a deal that cuts off all pathways for Iran getting a nuclear program or whether we should reject a deal, in which case, Iran can break out and start installing advanced centrifuges and potentially pursue a nuclear weapon without us having eyes on what is going on on the ground or any significant constraints until it is too late. And that is a substantive disagreement that we have but on a whole range of issues particularly with respect to Israel's security, we have been with Israel every step of the way. And even Prime Minister Netanyahu's government would acknowledge that. Let us take it back home. In your speech yesterday, you seem to compare Republicans who are against this deal to some of the hardliners in Iran, who are chanting death to America in the streets. But I think many people want to know, there is also Democrats you know who are on the fence about this deal. And what would you say to them? Well, I am talking to them all the time. And first of all, remember what I said was, that, it is the hardliners in Iran who are most opposed to this deal. And I said in that sense, they are making common cause with those who were opposed to this deal here. I did not say that they were equivalent. And I think that what you see are people who are assuming confrontation is inevitable and are unwilling to seize the possibility that we could shape an agreement that does not solve all conflicts, but that does solve a very serious problem without resort to war. And what I have said to Democrats who are still trying to figure things out is, just read what is in the text. Listen to the arguments. See what counter arguments exist on the other side. There are going to be some Democrats who end up opposing this deal, partly because as I said yesterday in the speech, the affinity that we all feel towards the state of Israel is profound, it is deep. And you know when Israel is opposed to something a lot of Democrats, as well as Republicans, pay attention. The difference though, is that most of the Democratic senators have taken the time to actually read the bill and listen to the arguments. A sizeable proportion of the Republicans were opposed before the ink was even dry on the deal before it was even posted, and that gives you sense of the degree to which this is driven by partisan politics or ideology as opposed to analysis. And is there any criticism of the deal that you do think is legitimate? Oh, absolu well, what I have said is that there are concerns that are legitimate. It is absolutely true that Iran has a history of trying to play it close to the line when it comes to its nuclear program. And so we do have to be very vigilant about inspections. It is true that under this agreement in 15 years time, they will be in a position to install more powerful centrifuges that produce uranium and that at that point they could conceivably break out and try to get a nuclear weapon. The point there, that I have made, that I think is indisputable, and in fact, former Israeli intelligence officers have made the same point, is that we will have just as much if not more ability to stop them at that point than they would if they are doing it right now and in the meantime we would have purchased 15 years in which we know exactly what they are doing and can have a lot more assurance about understanding their program. It is true that by definition, under this agreement, Iran's economy improves because they get sanctions relief. That was the incentive for them to enter into this deal. And some of that probably goes to help finance some of the dangerous activities that they are involved with anyway, but in that circumstance, as I have said before, we can deal with conventional challenges from Iran. What creates real problems for us is if they get a nuclear weapon so we have to prioritize. So, the point is, on all these, on any international agreement, there is always some give and take. You never get 100% of what you want. And the world is a big, complicated and sometimes dangerous place, so you have to apply judgments to what is the most important thing and how do you best achieve it, given the realities of the situation. And what I have not heard yet, is an argument for rejecting this deal that results in a better chance for us to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and since that is our number one priority, we have to make choices and this is by far the best choice. I want to show you our final question from a young person here in the U.S. Hi President Obama. Our international partners P5+1, they have worked tirelessly to open up trade for Iran for the benefit of their own economies. How difficult would it be to convince these countries to snap back sanctions in the scenario that Iran breaks its promises? Well, first of all, I think it is important for everybody to understand that the reason our sanctions were so successful was because our P5+1 partners cooperated with us. But they did so voluntarily. They did so because they too saw that Iran getting a nuclear weapon would cause huge problems. And so they have not been working tirelessly to open up trade for Iran, they have maintained sanctions up until this point. What is true is that once sanctions come down, there will be commercial ties that develop between these other countries and Iran but, in most cases, those commercial ties already exist. So let us take China for an example. China is a big purchaser of oil. They are an economy that has been growing faster than any economy in history over the last 20 years. They have got a huge population. They need more oil than they produce. And so they were already purchasing Iranian oil and investing in Iran's oil sector before I went to them and said you need to stop this and slow it down so that we can put pressure on Iran to get rid of their nuclear weapon. And they have done that. And once they have assurances that a nuclear weapon is not being developed then they are free to trade with Iran. Now, if in fact Iran is breaking the deal, then the good news about the snap back provisions is that we do not have to get Chinese approval or Russian approval to put those back in force. There is a UN resolution that allows us to trigger that snapback and all the sanctions move back into place. But most importantly, I think what everyone needs to understand is that the backstop that we have to this whole deal, ultimately, is if, in fact, if we had to, we will still have the capability to act militarily to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. We always have that ability in reserve. But the central point of my speech yesterday and the central argument that I have been making since I have been president is that rather than use our military as a first resort -- we should be using that as a last resort. And where we can achieve these goals diplomatically, we are more likely to get what we want with a lot less cost, a lot less bloodshed. And we should have learned that after now coming off of over a decade of war. Final, very quick question. Tonight is the first Republican debate. If you could ask a question about this deal to the candidates, what would it be tonight? Provide a detailed, plausible alternative. And I have been listening to them for a long time. I am doubtful that they will. Great, well, I want to thank you so much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjakehorowitzmic", "title": "Interview with Jake Horowitz of Mic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jake-horowitz-mic", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 255, "text": "If you continue to have these successes, that you can maintain the level of security in Iraq with fewer U.S. Troops, obviously people are going to embrace that and say what exactly did he mean by that? What did you mean? Exactly what I said. That we are having good success on the ground from a security perspective. And that General Petraeus and Ryan Crocker tell me that if we continue to have that kind of success - if, then we can do the same job with fewer troops. And they will report back to the country in a week. And as to what there recommendation is to me about troop levels and different aspects of making sure we succeed in Iraq. Are you saying that possibly some troops will be coming home by Christmas? I am saying that people need to pay attention to what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker say to the Congress, because they will say to the Congress what they have recommended to me. I know you said, ENTITY, this was not prompted by an agenda in Washington or by the media, but in a way does this hopefully, in your view, placate critics of the war on Capitol Hill? You know, I do not know ENTITY, that is a good question. I would certainly hope so. In other words, if we are able to re-deploy at some point in time I would hope so, because the stakes are very high. Failure in Iraq could be a disaster for the United States. Failure in Iraq would empower and embolden these extremists, some of whom attacked us in the past. Success in Iraq would be a major blow in this ideological struggle. So American people have got to understand that what happens in Iraq matters in the streets. So therefore I would hope people would, you know, listen to the facts and uh and remember that the security of the country is at stake. But just hearing those two words, troop reduction; do you think it will win some people over who are uncomfortable with this war? That was just speculating. It is not going to win anybody over until it becomes a reality. And what I would ask Congress to do is wait to see what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say. Having said that, ENTITY, do you think people on Capitol Hill are going to be receptive to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker or do you think people have pretty much made up their minds? I do not think so. I think there is people who think that we should never have been there in the first place. In other words, there is a group of people in Congress that said, you know getting rid of Saddam Hussein was not the right thing to do nor should we be there. That is a point of view, I think they are wrong but nevertheless it is a solid point of view. I think others are saying can we win? Does it make sense and can we achieve our mission and objectives? And therefore I would ask those, before they make up their mind, to listen very carefully to what these two fine citizens report. Did you give the Iraqi leaders with whom you met tonight a stern talking to, including prime minister Maliki? Oh yeah, they know my position and my position is that reconciliation is going to be vital. In other words, here needs to be more than just security in order for this country to reconcile What did you say to them? Well I said, 'listen; thanks for what you did two weeks ago.' They came together, the five of them, and put together a good agenda. And I said, 'now just follow through.' But I am also wise enough to understand that because of years of brutality because of a dictator it is hard it is hard work. They share the same goals, which is important. They share the goal of having a country that governs and defends and sustains itself. They just do not share a goal of who is going to govern it. Well that is not true. Actually, I think they are all very comfortable with the current government structure. What they are having problems getting to is passing law. They did pass sixty laws last year. They passed a very significant budget. They understand that we expect them to pass more laws, but reconciliation happens from the bottom up as well as the top down, and the reason I have come to Anbar province is because you are seeing reconciliation. You are seeing local folks getting sick and tired of al Qaeda and helping coalition forces deal a blow to al Qaeda, which by the way makes this country more secure. The surge was designed to help the Iraqi government to move forward. Do you believe there really is tangible evidence worthy of 30,000 additional American troops? Oh absolutely. First of all there is security you cannot move forward without security. I mean if people are sitting around saying I am worried about my life , it is difficult to get political reconciliation. Security yields political reconciliation. This example is the classic case of bottom up reconciliation. This is a province where people said we have lost this to al Qaeda . And now you and I stand in it knowing full well that Al-Qaeda's on the run. And so ityeah we are making progress. But this is a Sunni area, and you do not have the sectarian problems that you do in other places in Iraq. Well you do have people who is psyche was terribly scarred by Saddam Hussein as the Sheikh told me in the meeting. He said, look you gotta understand we were brutalized by Saddam Hussein just like others were. There are mixed neighborhoods in Baghdad that are doing just fine. Listen, it is going to take time. And the question is, whether or not the United States of America understands the consequences of failure in Iraq. And I certainly hope they do and I will continue to make the case that failure in Iraq in other words, if we leave Iraq before the job is done, the enemy will follow us home and that is important for people to understand. And if Congress is not receptive to General Petraeus' message What do you mean if Congress, are you I do not know Well I do not know either. But .What are your options? I would hope that Congress would pay attention to what General Petraeus has to say. He is a unless they really do not care about failure. If people do not care whether we fail or not it is going to be a tough sell. If there are people in Congress like I think there are who are deeply concerned about the security of the United States, I think they will listen very carefully to what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say.

{"id": 88, "text": "ENTITY, this is kind of a broad way to begin, but tell us what is America's biggest problem right now. Right now, world peace having been enhanced, progress having been made as we start a whole new approach to education -- although we have got big problems there -- I think it is the economy. I think it is that people do not have confidence. Unemployment figures just came out today for October: up another one-tenth of 1 percent, 6.8 percent. What can be done? Well, in the first place, these things need to be in perspective. It does not help to tell someone that is out of work, Unemployment is 6.8 percent, and that is far lower than in recession times when I was Vice President back in the '81 - '82 days. It happens to be true. I would have a mixed message, and it would be this: One, for those that are hurting, we have got to help; those whose unemployment benefits have run out, send me a bill that I can sign that does not further burden everybody else by busting the budget agreement. Secondly, using hindsight, I would have liked to have thought that Congress would move on the package that I put forward to stimulate economic growth: IRA's, a transportation bill, a capital gains reduction, and things that actually create jobs. Lacking that, we have got to fight for a package that will stimulate. And then thirdly, I'd say I believe the economy is recovering. It grew at 2.4 percent over the previous quarter, in the third quarter. And yet, you go tell some guy at Compaq that is getting laid off, and he is not interested in that. He wants to know, How about my job, my family? I am worried. And so, I have got to be careful I do not over-cheerlead on this economy, but I do not want to talk people into a further lack of confidence because it is a good time to buy a house, frankly. It is a good time to buy a car in terms of historic interest rates. It is a good time for sound banks to make sound loans. And we have got a banking reform bill that would further enhance credit. I have been worried about that. We are working with the regulators to lighten up on some of the regulation that is causing banks to loan less money. So, the message is mixed. But when someone is hurting, I must be concerned. And I am. And we are trying hard. Would you like to see the Federal Reserve cut interest rates at all? Yes. I'd like to see them down more. They have been worried, and I think at times properly worried, about inflation. Nobody likes that insidious stealth tax; it rips it out of everybody's pocketbook. But yes, I think we could go down more on rates. And again, an ENTITY has to be careful. What I say -- it seems hard for you to believe, having known me all these years, but this affects the markets and there is procedures for doing these things. But you have asked a frank question, and I have given you a frank answer. You may have a Democratic opponent who is calling for a capital gains tax. Great! I read one, Tsongas I think, says capital gains tax promotes reinvestment. A lot of them are talking about it now, but the old thinkers in Congress are unwilling to do it because they are thinking politically, We do not want to give the President a victory. I told them last night, I said: Look, give me all the political grief. You call it a tax for the rich. Lay that on. Keep on with your rhetoric. But let us try it. It worked in '78. It created new jobs. It added revenues to the Federal Government -- did not cost the taxpayers a thing. Let us try it. Let us try to create jobs through the incentive that comes with entrepreneurship. It is small business that is the backbone of this country. But we are in a political fight, and yet, I think some are coming this way. I have even heard some of the most unlikely sources talking about it now. So, we are going to keep on it. I am not saying it is a magic that is going to solve everything, but our package will help a lot. A lot of people blame our social ills in our country on the breakdown of the family, giving us social problems. Do not those eventually evolve into economic problems? Certainly. And I -- oh, ENTITY, I will tell you -- -- What can be done about it? Well, I am not sure the Federal Government can do a heck of a lot about that: the dissolution of family, marriages breaking up wantonly and at random, children left with nobody knowing their names. I think one thing we can do is safeguard against legislation that is going to inflict mandates on families. I am for parental choice, for example, in education. I fought hard and got a child care bill that lets the parents choose how this should work. I do not want to sound holier-than-thou, but you are on to something. The dissolution of the family is a bad thing. And I might put in a plug for what Barbara Bush does here because I think the American people see in her somebody that epitomizes a family value. She goes into any neighborhood; it does not matter who votes for who. It is not going to matter next year. She will be there holding somebody's hand, holding an AIDS baby in her arms, helping with education, getting parents to read to their children. You are talking about family strength. That is a wonderful thing. And it may seem small to some people, but I think the American people see, well, that she practices what she preaches in terms of family. And I am very proud of her. And I want to try, myself, to assist without trying to mastermind the family problems of individuals. But I worry about it all the time: The dissolution of the American family, the relaxing of traditional values. It troubles me. But you cannot legislate it. It is not something that -- you cannot legislate moral behavior in this country. Another trouble spot that we have in Houston and, well, nationwide, but really in Houston -- we have got a horrible crime problem, and we are one of the five drug hotspots in the country. You have said communities should solve their own problems, and I understand that. But we are struggling. We are having a hard time. Is there more that can be done? ENTITY, you are right. In the first place, the community action is a very important way. I hope I have not said it to the exclusion of Federal participation. We have got a crime bill that proposes tough anti-crime legislation: habeas corpus reform and a whole bunch of things that I think would strengthen the hand of the police, would be tougher on the criminals, including more rapid capital punishment for those that kill police officers and involved in this insidious narcotics business. So, we have a program here that can help. But again, I think communities do have to move forward. And Houston is trying. Houston is trying hard. I think our police chief is trying hard in this. I think our officers, some of whom I know and respect, are out there on the front line. And what the Federal Government must do is support them. And that is what our crime bill will do. But the liberal Democrats have a very different, softer kind of let us -help-rehabilitate-the-criminal approach. And I think we have tried that, and it is failed. And yes, I am for some rehabilitation, but I want to support the policeman on the block. And I do not care whether it is a Democrat policeman, Republican policeman, liberal, conservative: they deserve our support. And I need some help from Congress. Some speculation that the next drug summit might be held in Houston. Do you have any word on that? Well, I'd like to see it held in the United States. The last one was in Cartagena. You see, it is my view -- and I am not talking defensively here -- I think that working with foreign countries on antinarcotics, I do not think that is foreign policy. They say, Bush spends too much time on foreign policy. Yes, I went to Colombia and met with them, but I think that helps every neighborhood in Houston, Texas, if we can make more progress on interdicting drugs. Now, I have invited leaders of many of these countries to a meeting next year, and I'd like to see it in the United States. And it might well turn out to be in Texas. Other States, of course, are interested, and some are accusing me of funneling a little too many events into Houston. But this is my home, and I am not apologetic about it. And we are a crossroads; we are a community here that can handle these things well. Our Governor, Ann Richards, she made a name for herself by kind of trashing you at that last convention. Would you like to say anything about the way she is running the Governor's office? Well, I do not want to be too nice to her, I mean -- but look, Ann had to do her thing, and she ran a good race. And I am told that in many areas she is getting along just fine. But everybody forgives a little excess political rhetoric. I do not think she will be running that same theme again in the future. If so, I will unleash on her. But right now I am in a kind and gentle mood towards our Governor. She is helping in a lot of the education initiatives that I believe in. Most Governors -- you know, our Education 2000 program is not Republican or Democrat. We have got tons of Democratic Governors supporting it. So, the jury is still out on her. The jury is still out on me. And let us see how she does. But I am not going to be carping and criticizing any Governor of Texas. It is my State. One last thing. The Washington Redskins, Houston Oilers, RFK this Sunday. Who are you going to be rooting for? I thought that might be the first thing with you. No, I have said this publicly since I have been in Houston, and I always start out by saying I have got great affection and respect for Joe Gibbs. You better have great affection and respect for Joe Gibbs if you want to live in Washington, even inside the fence in the White House. Besides that, he merits that. Joe is a -- God, what he does, the great work he does with kids. But look, Jack Pardee is my friend. The Oilers are my hometown club. Warren Moon is a guy not only that I respect, but I believe he'd recognize that we have a friendship, too. And so, I want the Oilers to win it. And I want them to go on and do so well that Barbara and I receive them in the White House as Super Bowl champs. So put that one out there, and I will go back and take the flak in DC tomorrow.

{"id": 542, "text": "Mr. ENTITY, I am Dan Thomasson, editor of Scripps-Howard News Service. I wish to say thank you in advance for your time in this busy schedule. We will just go right from there. Mr. ENTITY, how are you today? ENTITY, Fine. Nice to see you again, sir. I am Jim Wieghart with the Washington Bureau of Scripps-Howard. I thought I'd like to ask you today, in a relaxed way, looking ahead to the next 4 years, what do you think will be your main priorities in your second term? And secondly, do you anticipate making any changes in the Cabinet in your second term? Well, first of all, the priorities are, in a sense, going to be a continuation. Economically, we are going to continue trying the same overall things that were part of our program to begin with, and that is to continue trying to reduce the share that the government is taking from the private sector, from the gross national product, because I think that government can be, and was, a drag on the economy-still is. This, we believe, will-if we proceed with this-will also take care of the deficit problem. Because the real, only real way to raise government's revenues are not through tax increases, which further increase the drag in the economy; they are from growth in the economy. And we are going to continue trying, also, to make government less of a burden on business and private individuals with excessive regulations. To show you what can happen with just even a minor element in government: We lumped together 62 categorical grant programs into 10 block grants to local and State governments. That not only eliminated 3,000 people who had been administering the 62 grants at the Federal level, but it changed the regulations out there at the local and State level, which had taken 885 pages, reduced them down to 30. And it is this type of thing-much of this is what is contained in the recommendations of the commission that we had, and we are studying those 2,480 recommendations. We are going to proceed, as I say, with all of that-with tax reform, hoping to simplify it and make it possible for rates to come down again at the same time we broaden the base and, hopefully, can get some of that $100 billion that is now not coming in because of the underground economy; and in the international scene, to continue our two-track policy. One of them is, of course, the building of our own defensive capability. But at the same time, the other track is to try and get the Soviet Union to join us in realistic arms reduction talks. The overall goal is peace, and this is what we will continue. Now, with regard to any Cabinet changes, I would be just satisfied if there were none at all. But I do know that while no one has said anything, other than the resignation we know about of the Attorney General who has to return, or feels he must return to his private practice, the-I know that when you ask, whenever I ask people to serve, whether on the staff or there, I made it plain that I'd take them for whatever time they could come. And if they then felt they had to leave, why I'd go out and find somebody else. No one has made any suggestions about that, but there possibly would be some that might want to get back to their own private lives. And if so, I would understand. But I have no intention of-in other words, I am not unhappy with anyone. Mr. ENTITY, my name is David Brown, and I am the executive editor of the Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tennessee. As you are aware, a group of private citizens-many of them from west Tennessee and from north Alabama-in the past year have been engaged in taking supplies to the rebels fighting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. And not only have they taken supplies down there, but they have engaged in training. And two men were shot down and slain in the past few months. Since those two men were killed, hundreds more citizens have joined this group known as the CMA. I am wondering about your attitude, how you feel personally, about private citizens getting engaged in this way in what is happening in Central America. And as I ask this question, there are 30 Memphians who are getting ready, who are prepared to fly to Honduras this weekend to work with groups, they say, are in that country who want to overthrow the Sandinistas. So, is there an ever-growing number of people in our country who want to do something on their own to, as they put it, stop communism before it gets to our borders, and how do you feel about it? Well, I have to say it is quite in line with what has been a pretty well established tradition in our country. Nothing was done legally about the formation of a brigade, a Communist brigade of Americans in the Spanish Civil War. In World War II, we had pilots being recruited to go to the Flying Tigers. I recall, if I am correct, there were some people, even one very prominent actor from Hollywood who became an ambulance driver in the French Army in World War II. So, I do not know. I am not a lawyer, so I never asked about what is the actual legality of anything of that kind. But at the same time, as I say, it is been a tradition, and Americans have always done this. And I would be inclined to not want to interfere with them. Were not the examples that you raised people who went to fight for governments who were fighting other governments' tyranny? In this case, we have Americans who are going to Central America to help rebels. They call them freedom fighters. Do you see a difference there? Well, as I say, I am not so wise as those lawyer guys, as Mr. Service said in his poem. I have not really gotten into that. I was giving you-my own personal reaction to it was it seemed to be a long and honorable tradition. And in a sense, our own interest in Nicaragua has to do with their overt support of guerrillas, themselves, who are trying to overthrow a duly elected government of a neighboring country-El Salvador. So, no one has raised the issue before of these individual Americans. If it would not be illegal, would there be anything wrong with it in your mind, in any other way? Morally? Or can they get in the way of our government in trying to do something about the problems in Central America? Well, if you get into the moral issue of it, we were certainly tested with regard to that Spanish Civil War I mentioned, because I would say that the individuals that went there were, in the opinion of most Americans, fighting on the wrong side. Mr. ENTITY, Angus McEachran from the Pittsburgh Press. Mr. ENTITY, you took office 4 years ago, determined to drastically cut what you said were overly generous welfare programs. And in February of '81, just 1 month after taking office, you introduced 84 proposals to reduce or eliminate Federal programs that obviously took fat from the domestic side of the budget. Among those reductions was a 17.4-percent decrease in unemployment insurance, a 14.3-percent decrease in Aid to Dependent Children, a 13.8-percent decrease in food stamps, a 28-percent reduction in child nutrition, a 6.8-percent decrease in Medicare, and a 2.8 in Medicaid. Obviously, a great number of American people have agreed with you that some cuts were necessary. But the Urban Institute cites that the poverty level grew faster in the first 3 years of your Presidency than any other period since the fifties. The Congressional Budget Office in July reported that budget reductions alone-taking unemployment as an aside-but the budget reductions alone had pushed 560,000 people below the poverty line-325,000 of them children alone. Mr. ENTITY, what further cuts in welfare spending will be necessary in the next ENTITY administration? And secondly, how do you answer your opponents who say that you are practicing social Darwinism? Well, I answer them-first of all, I challenge the Urban Institute's figures. And I do not think that they can be substantiated at all, because we are spending more money today and helping more people than at any time in our nation's history. With regard to food, the increase in food programs is up 37 percent over what it was. We made cuts in suggested increases. We have reduced-on the domestic side of the budget-we have reduced the rate of increase in spending from 17 percent down to 6 percent. But in many of these figures, for example in food stamps, some of the so-called savings in food stamps-we are , incidentally, giving more food stamps to more people than we have ever done before in history. There are something like, oh, I think somewhere around 3 million more people are getting them than were getting them in 1980. But here we found, for example, that in food stamps, someone applied for food stamps, let us say it is 3 days before the end of the month, they were given the whole month's food stamps for the preceding month, for just those few days of the month left. Now, come the first of the month, they were due, again, a quota for the coming month. And we started giving them food stamps as of the day they asked for them, not retroactively for weeks before they'd put in the request. And that amounted to quite a percentage, in a reduction. We also, in many of these programs, found that there were people who were above an income level as to where they should be eligible for these programs, and what we did was redirect the attention down. And we have set for ourselves a standard of 130 percent of poverty-that that was the limit. Above that, it would have to be an exceptional case. But if they are below 130 percent of poverty, they were helped. So, the result was, for example, in school lunches there was a big increase for those people that were truly below the poverty line. What we did do was reduce somewhat the subsidy for the people up above that line. I think in one instance it prorated out-like the subsidy increased-these are people that pay something for the lunches, but not the full cost-I think one of those cuts meant that their personal payment was increased 3 cents per lunch. But this is true of most of the figures. And I have not really studied the ones I have seen-just sketchily-the Urban Institute's figures. But I do not see how they can claim those figures when we can show that in every instance and in every program we are spending more money and helping more people than ever before in our history. So, we intend to preserve the safety net. There is never been any intention to do away with that or to eliminate it. But things, such as I suggested earlier in these 2,470 or 80 recommendations of that commission that we had of some 2,000 business people in this country, looking at areas where modern business practices could be put to work. The Federal Government has a substantially higher overhead cost for delivering $1 of services to the people than any other level of government in this country. And I do not see why it should necessarily be higher for us than it is for them. And so these are the areas where we think-when sometimes you see what looks like a reduction-well, maybe we have just been more efficient in getting the job done. But we have not hurt the people that are dependent on the program. Now, you mentioned Medicare. And I have to be frank and tell you, there is a problem with Medicare. It is not as bad as the problem we had with Social Security, in which it was slated to go bankrupt before July of 1983. Now, our opponents, and Tip O'Neill in the lead, they challenged us and said that was not true. And they were right; it was not true-the program went belly-up in November of 1982. It did not get to July of 1983. We borrowed $17 billion to keep the cheeks from bouncing. That was when we, then-after they had used it in the '82 campaign as demagogically as they had-that was when we went back and said, Now-we have been asking you for 3 years-now will you sit down with us in a bipartisan commission and figure out an answer to this Social Security problem? And they did. And we figured it out, and Social Security is as safe now as it can be, as far as we can see into the next century. And we did not cut the benefits to the recipients in our bipartisan plan. So, I think a lot of these figures to try and point out that we somehow have been trying to balance the budget on the backs of the needy is just not true. The needy are being cared for. And I will have to get some of our people to go to work on that set of figures. Mr. ENTITY, what do you consider be your administration's most important! achievement in the field of conservation of natural resources? Well, they are very much more than anyone's giving us credit for. You have seen some criticism in Florida recently about that. Yes. Well, the one that they are presently saying the most about is the Superfund and the cleanup of the toxic waste dumps. Well, the Superfund was passed before we got here, and there had been very little time for this-for inventorying these dumps and where they may be in the country. And so, it is on our watch that we have found out, so far, that there are probably 1,400 or more such dumps that do represent the potential for being a toxic waste threat. And so far, we have begun work on about 600 of them-completed work on a half a dozen. So, the campaign charges that we have only cleaned up six-well, we think we are doing pretty well. What we had to do-now many of these, they take some study to find out if they truly are a threat-and what we are doing are rating them as to what are the most imminent threats, the most dangerous, and going at those as fast as we can. We are going to support, of course, the renewal of the Superfund next year when it is due, to continue on that. But that is just one facet. We found that the parks were a threat healthwise, from a safety factor, and just simply from a point of pollution and cleanliness. The maintenance had been so poor over a number of years. So, we stopped for a time buying additional land for the parks and set aside a billion dollars for a 5-year cleanup plan of the national parks. That is just about completed now, a year ahead of schedule. And the parks are restored with regard to cleanliness and safety features that were being violated. And we now have budgeted for going back to purchasing land for parks. We have added to the wetlands. We have added to the wildlife refuges. We have added millions and millions of acres to the national wilderness. The pure air and pure water act, which were in place before we got here, are implemented to the point that we have the cleanest air and water that we have had since 1970-I mean it is been cleaned up since that time. And the doubling of the research for acid rain was because we discovered that the more we had learned about acid rain, the more we found out we needed to know. And the truth of the matter is the cleanup would represent over $100 billion if you just simply said we must eliminate all the rest of sulfur dioxide from the air that industry is putting there. And yet we had to say-from the research that had been done so far-there was no assurance that that cleanup would solve the acid rain problem. We found, as we continued researching, a lot of things we'd never known before. And so, we are going to continue as fast as we can with that research, and then we will do whatever has to be done. We are experimenting with liming some lakes, which can restore those lakes. But I do not know what other elements of it-you know, being the villain of the environmental piece is kind of strange for me, because we started the whole thing in California when I was Governor. And the Federal Government sent people out to see us because they said we were so far ahead of anything that they were doing. Mr. ENTITY, Tom Tuley, from Evansville, Indiana-not far from Dixon, Illinois. Where? Not far from Dixon, Illinois. Oh, well. You mentioned Social Security. I asked our readers in advance of this trip what questions they would like to ask of the ENTITY, and my mail showed an overwhelming concern in our community for Social Security. There is a real fear that in a second term that you would cut benefits. How can you answer those people? This, of course, is the same demagoguery that they heard in 1982 and why, in all of 1981, we were never able to persuade our opponents to join us in what we asked for-the same bipartisan commission we eventually wound up with. And they were set on using that, and, of course, those people are frightened. And I think it is disgraceful-people that are dependent on Social Security, past their earning years, have no place else to turn, and someone comes around telling them that there are people that have got some secret plan to. take this away from them. Well, why has not anyone pointed out that the increase in taxes in 1977, in the previous administration, to try and straighten out Social Security-and they said that they had straightened it out till the year 2015, and they had not straightened it out-well, they said for 50 years-they had not straightened it out for 5. And not only was it a massive tax increase, but everyone that was born after 1916 gets Social Security at a 25-percent less rate than the people that are presently on it. So, in 1981 the people who started going on Social Security, they are getting cheeks 25-percent lower than the others. That was part of that 1977 plan. But, no, there would be no reason for us to change it. The program has been placed on a sound financial basis. And I just think if you ladies and gentlemen of the press would go out of the way a little bit to tell these frightened senior citizens that they are going to continue to get their payments, and no one is going to take anything away from them-in that regard, good Lord, I volunteered that if we got inflation below 3 percent, the law said we did not have to give them a cost-of-living increase, and I said we would, anyway, because we had delayed them for 6 months during this new program of ours-that they'd gone without getting their raise for an extra 6 months before it was instituted. And I thought it was only fair that the first year that we did get this below the figure of the law, that we'd go ahead and give it to them anyway. The point is-and you can, with a clear conscience, reassure them-Social Security is not a part of the deficit or the deficit problem. Social Security is entirely funded by a payroll tax. And if you reduced Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to pay back that; it would go back into the trust fund of Social Security. So, when anyone starts saying, What are you going to do about that, about reducing the deficit? -it does not have anything to do with the deficit. Mr. ENTITY? Yes. Harry Moskos, Knoxville News-Sentinel. The antinuclear atmosphere intimidates private industry, making it skeptical about committing to long-term, long-scale energy demonstration projects. If the Government does not fund these projects, research vital to the Nation's energy future could be killed or hopelessly delayed. What is the administration's position? Well, I think there is an area in which you can say that you cannot , just because someone is afraid to move forward on something, that the government, then, ought to finance that. I believe in nuclear power, and I think that the fear that is been generated of it is almost superstitious and unwarranted completely. When you stop to think that here is a power source that we have had now in operation for quite some number of years, and there has never been a nuclear fatality in that industry, and then you compare that to coal mining and a few other things, you wonder why and how this fear is justified. I know that there is a thing that people think that a nuclear power plants something that can turn into a nuclear bomb and blow up. Well, that is impossible, and it cannot . But what we need is more education of the people that nuclear power is a safe source of energy. And there are other countries that have gone far beyond what we have done in that regard, and they have , most of them, had the same safety records that we have had in it. I do not think it is a case of us funding this. I think it is a case of, between all of us-one thing that government can do, and I have asked our people to do-and that is to see if we cannot shortcut some of the requirements that we make. For example, when I was Governor of California, I discovered that someone that wanted to build a nuclear powerplant, they had to get 65 environmental clearances, and there was no one-window stop. They could not go to one place and get cleared. Now, they could spend millions of dollars going down through this with the knowledge that when they got to the 65th, that one could cancel out all the progress that they'd made, and they still would not be able to, even after they'd spent all those millions of dollars. It seems to me what we need is a kind of a, as I say, a one-window stop. And, of course, this is not all Federal Government. A lot of these requirements are at different levels of government. But this is one of the things that is-when you see a company that is spent billions of dollars and they still, then, cannot get a clearance to operate-we have got to do something about that. Mr. ENTITY granted what you say is true about Social Security, that it is now in a position where it can be funded adequately, what about Medicare? That is a problem coming up in your administration. Well, I did mention that earlier, but I did not explain. It is not as imminent; it is got several more years before it would find that. But it has a fund with its trust fund, the Medicare fund. And what we are suggesting right now, and are talking about, are some things, actually, rather than aiming them at the recipients, we are aiming at the providers. And we have proposed to hospitals and doctors, but particularly the hospitals, that we have a set of fees for various ailments, and we are trying-we are doing that right now-in which the hospital accepts this. And if they cannot provide the care within the fee, that is out of their pocket. But if they can provide it for less than the fee, they get that profit. They can- I doubt whether many will provide it for less. Well, no, because there is an incentive to provide it for less: that if they can provide the service less than our fee, they get to keep the difference. Oh, I see. Yes. But the other way then, the penalty is, if they spend more, that is out of their pocket. Sir, it does not just take a massive campaign with the hospital administrators, the whole medical profession? Well, we have had no great protest so far on this. ENTITY's Closing Statement in Foreign Policy Debate Mr. ENTITY, before somebody else steps in and cuts us off after 4 minutes, can you finish the California time capsule letter that you were in the process of explaining? I had finished with the letter on the air and was simply getting to the point of what I was going to say. And I have been saying it on these college campuses the last few days that I have been out there, that I was going to say that we had the responsibility, all of us, as I put it, my generation and a few generations between mine and theirs, to see that they were turned over, by us-or we turned over to them-a nation that was free in a world that was at peace. And that was the gist of it. But I have to tell you, I was telling the truth, and I ad-libbed that whole thing in the 1976 convention when Jerry Ford asked me to come down to the platform and say a few words. And that was the first-well, the only time up until now that I had ever voiced this. But what had happened, the idea was, what our people a hundred years from now are going to say about us, and did we do right by them or wrong by them? But the thing was that I truly was riding down the coast-I said driving. Actually, I was riding, and somebody else was driving, and I was trying to put down some notes. But when I was looking around and thinking, that is when it struck me, Wait a minute, I am talking about a letter as if I am writing to some people that do not know about us. And I realized that I had a much harder problem than I had thought, that that letter-how do you write to somebody that is read all about us in the history books, knows all our problems and what we did? And I wrote the letter then with that idea in mind: that what I could be telling them about they might not know was how we approached what we thought about in these things, and what were the controversies and so forth in the thinking. Somebody is cutting you off. Okay. Cannot I take one more? I wanted to tell you I had lunch with Mel Laird yesterday, and he told me he sent a telegram to Edwin Newman, and he said: Dear Ed, thank you for limiting the ENTITY's time. I was afraid he might take a left turn on Highway 101 and drive into the ocean. Well, you know, everyone had told me wrong. I was afraid that-I knew what I was going to say in that closing statement and had it all planned-but I was afraid it might be a little over 4 minutes. But our people gave me the wrong steer. They said because I was going last, that it did not matter then anymore. I did not know Mr. Newman was going to be so gung ho, and he shut me off. But I have told it to the kids, and I must tell you: 13,000 students at Ohio State University the other day, they just loved the finish. Listen, I am sorry that the questions kind of seemed to get me here on a filibuster on some of them. But they should have been yes-and-no questions. Mr. ENTITY? Well, I will answer him while I am walking out. Stay seated, please. This is a light question. Doonesbury's back in the papers in the country, and a lot of editors are getting a lot of heat from readers who think he is unfairly criticizing you. Some think it is a parody of your critics. Do you ever have occasion to read Doonesbury? And what do you think of it? I am a devoted comic strip reader. I read every comic strip in the paper. And so, when he came back I started reading him. I have to tell you that I think some of your readers are absolutely right.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrepresentativesthescrippshowardnewsservice", "title": "Interview With Representatives of the Scripps-Howard News Service", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-representatives-the-scripps-howard-news-service", "publication_date": "25-10-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 198, "text": "ENTITY, I was in Uganda when you announced your African education initiative. It was very, very impressive. Is there a role for foundation and the private sector in helping us? Oh, absolutely. There is no way that just through Government aid from the United States and other countries we can do all this. And a lot of operations like the Discovery Channel can even more efficiently hook up these schools, give them the basics that they need, a television set, a satellite, the VCR's. Then eventually we will be able to come in with the computers, and we will be able to have interactive access to the Internet and even interactive communication across national lines. But we have to begin to put in place a technological infrastructure in these schools. And since we can now leapfrog a lot of the early investments that schools would have had to make 10 or 20 years ago, we can actually do it more cheaply. In other words, they will not have to have a thousand volumes in their library that they could never afford if we can do enough through educational television. You also talked about the relationship, in this case, between one school, I believe it is in Silver Spring, Maryland, and a school in Uganda. That is right. Are there other things American kids can do to help here in Africa in terms of education? Oh, yes. First of all, I think it is important to set up as many partnerships as possible. And if the children have access to the Internet in the African schools, if we can get that done, then they can actually communicate directly through the Internet. But there are lots of other things we can do. If we have partnerships children in American schools, for example, could have book drives and send books to children a lot of children in African schools do not have access to any of the books that American kids take for granted. Then they could write back and forth and talk about the books they are reading. Or they could make sure they have a television and access to some of your Discovery tapes, and then they could write back and forth and talk about what they'd seen together. I think that this is the kind of thing that we want to promote more of. Great. And the last question? I think a lot of Americans would be surprised that in many of the African countries boys are treated differently than girls. Do you see a change coming there? Yes, we are working hard to support that. But you see this in a lot of developing nations around the world, where boys and girls have a different role in traditional society and where girls have not traditionally been educated. Now, as they move to a more modern society, young girls have the same aspirations: They want to develop their minds; they want to go out and live their lives. And we have worked very hard to support education for young girls. One of the things I like best about the Ugandan educational initiative is that they want universal primary education for all their children. And they are going out and recognizing the schools where the enrollment and the graduation rates are just as high for girls as for boys. That is a big priority. But it is a big change for Africa, but Africa is not alone in that. That is a worldwide issue we have to keep working on. Thank you very much, sir.

{"id": 189, "text": "And now to . ENTITY, welcome. Thank you, ENTITY. I am glad to be here. Is the peace process, the withdrawal of the Serb troops and the other matters, proceeding on schedule today? So far it is proceeding in an orderly way. The Serb forces are withdrawing. They are withdrawing in a fashion that appears to our commanders to be consistent with their commitment to be gone in the 11-day time period. And General Jackson is readying our forces to deploy. When will that happen, do you think? First, NATO troops when will they go in now? I think it will be quite soon. It is his decision, and they are I think there are a number of factors that are going into his thinking, but they will have to be in there pretty soon because they are determined not to let some big vacuum develop. But they have a lot of plans to make, and they are mapping them, starting with a strategy for demining, and then dealing with the refugees that are brought back and those that want to come back on their own. And they are working that. But I would expect it would be quite soon. What is your reading of this Russian troop movement today that caused such a turmoil? The Russian troops came from Bosnia into Serbia, and there was some idea that they may go into Kosovo. What is going on? Well, the last we heard was, I think, when Mr. Ivanov told Secretary Albright that they were just pre-positioning, but that they recognized that we had to work out the arrangements for their participation. And even as we speak, there are discussions going on about that. Do you foresee a major problem developing over this? I do not really think so, but there are some factors I would imagine they will have to work through. And I have not received a detailed briefing. But, for example, we are going to have almost 30 countries this time in this operation, and I would expect that in each one of the zones of responsibility, the areas of responsibility, there will be multiple countries. The Russians, I think, would like to play a major role, but they understand we have to have unity of command under General Jackson. That is the sine qua non of the whole thing. But we also know in every zone we have to have two things: First of all, there has to be the fact and the feeling of safety and security so the Kosovars will go home; secondly, in those sectors where there are Serbs, they have to know that we are committed to protecting them, too. And a lot of thought has been given to how that might best be done and how the Russians can make the strongest contribution there. So our commanders, their people, they are talking about it. They are talking it through, and I expect they will resolve it. ENTITY, were you surprised that Milosevic hung in there as long as he did, for 78 days? Not after the beginning. When we started this, I thought there would be one of three possible scenarios. First of all, I absolutely reject the theory that some people have advanced that what he did was worse than he would have done if we had not bombed as early as we did. I just simply do not believe that. He had this plan laid out; he was going to carry it into effect last October. He did not do it because of the threat of bombing. So what I knew was that if he decided to behave as he had in Bosnia, that there would be a day or two of bombing, then we'd make this agreement that we made today, or a couple of days ago, and it would be over; but that there was a strong chance that it would not, because in the mind of Mr. Milosevic there was a big difference between Bosnia and Kosovo. Bosnia was something that he wanted badly that he did not have. Kosovo was something that he had that he wanted to take absolute control of by running people out of. So once he decided to take the bombing, I was not surprised that he took it for quite a long while, because he kept looking for ways to break the unity of NATO. He kept looking for ways to turn someone against what we were doing. Of course, the third scenario was that the bombing never worked and we had to take even more aggressive measures. But I always thought there was a much better than 50-50 chance that this bombing campaign would work. And I am gratified that it has achieved our objectives. What was it, or who was it, that convinced you that bombing alone would work? Well, you know, when I talked to the American people about this in the beginning, I made it clear that there was no way that any bombing campaign could literally physically extract every Serbian soldier and paramilitary operative and put them back out of Kosovo. But I knew that our people had made dramatic progress in the last few years, even since Desert Storm, in precision-guided weapons and in the capacity of our planes to deliver them and to avoid even fairly sophisticated antiaircraft operations. And I just felt that if we worked at it and we could hold the coalition together, that we'd be able to do enough damage that we could do it. And Secretary Cohen and General Shelton felt there was a better than 50-50 chance we could do it; Mr. Berger did. Better than 50-50 was as good Yes Secretary Albright did. And I just I have been dealing with Mr. Milosevic now a long time, you know, more than 6 years, and I think I have some understanding of the politics and the environment in Serbia. And I just felt if we kept pounding away that we could raise the price to a point where it would no longer make any sense for him to go on and where he could no longer maintain his position if he did. And I regret that he required his people to go through what they have gone through, to lower their incomes as much as they have been lowered and to erode their quality of life as much as it is been eroded and even to have the civilian casualties which have been sustained, although they are far, far less than they were in Desert Storm after the bombing, for example. Still, I hate it. But what we did miraculously resulted in no combat air losses to our people we did lose two fine Army airmen in training and minimized the losses to their people, to their civilians. But it did a terrible amount of damage. And finally, they could not go on; it did not make any sense. ENTITY, as I am sure you are aware, the fact of no casualties by NATO has been used as a criticism of the whole approach here that yes, ethnic cleansing was bad in Kosovo; yes, we needed to do something; but it was not worth risking any American lives to do so. Well, now, first of all, I never said that, that it was not worth risking any lives. We did risk lives, and I think the American people should know that. Our pilots, particularly the pilots in our A-10's, they were quite frequently fired upon by people holding these shoulder missiles, and they would deliberately position themselves in populated areas where there were civilians living. And over and over again, our pilots risked their lives by avoiding firing back, when they could easily have taken those people out who were firing at them. But to do so would have killed civilians. So there was risk to the lives. I remind you, we lost two airplanes and had to go in there and rescue two pilots. So that is not true. Secondly, if we had put a ground force in for an invasion, it still would not be done today. That is, all this bombing we did, we would have had to do anyway. Let me take you back to Operation Desert Storm, where we deployed a half-million people in the theater; took, as I remember, 4 1/2 or 5 months to do it; bombed for 44 days there, but because of the terrain and the weather, they dropped more ordnance in 44 days than we did in our 79-day campaign. So we would have had to do everything we have done to do this. I told the American people at the time that we could not have mounted and executed an invasion that would have stopped this ethnic cleansing, because at the time the Rambouillet talks broke down, when the Kosovars accepted it and the Serbs did not , keep in mind, he already had 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo, and nearly 300 tanks. So no force there was no way to mobilize and implant a force quick enough to turn it back. And somehow the suggestion that our moral position would have been improved if only a few more Americans had died, I think is wrong. Believe me, fewer Serbs died than would die if we had had to invade. We would have had to deploy a force of about 200,000. We would have put them at great risk just getting them into the country. That was actually the biggest risk. I do not think the combat, once in the country, was nearly as big a risk as the problems of deploying into Kosovo. But I just do not accept that. I do not think that we moved aggressively. We were criticized by some people in the Congress and elsewhere for starting the bombing too soon. And those who say that we should have used ground forces, even if we had announced on day one we were going to use ground forces, it would have taken as long as this bombing campaign went on to deploy them, probably longer. What about just the threat of ground forces? You were criticized you and your fellow NATO leaders were criticized for taking it off the table at the very beginning, telling Milosevic all he had to do was hunker down. I was afraid that I had done that when I said to the American people that I did not intend to use ground forces. And shortly thereafter in an interview, I made it clear that I did not do that. And then repeatedly I said that, and I said I thought we ought to be planning for ground forces. So I think the differences, for example, between the British position and ours and others were somewhat overstated, because we had done quite a lot of planning for a ground force, and we had made it explicit that we were not taking the option off the table. And Chancellor Schroeder from Germany was reported as having done so. When I talked to him and examined the German text of what he'd said, it was obvious that there had been a little bit of overstatement there. So I do not think I think that the NATO my own view is if this had not worked, NATO would have put ground forces in there and that we were determined not to lose this thing, that we were determined to reverse the ethnic cleansing. I think the Europeans were especially sensitive, as I was, to the fact that it took 4 years to mobilize an action against Bosnia and that there were all kinds of arguments used about it, including the fact that U.N. peacekeepers were there, diplomacy was going on, any action would have upset all that, and they did not want that to happen this time. So the truth is that this action against ethnic cleansing was hugely more rapid and more responsive than what was done in Bosnia. And that is why there will not be nearly as many lost lives. On a more personal basis, ENTITY, some suggest when this operation began that the Lewinsky impeachment matter had weakened your moral authority to lead the country in a difficult situation like this. Were they wrong? Oh, I think so. I think the American people have been very good to me, and my family's been very good to me. And we went through a process which resulted in a decision by the public and by the Congress that I should serve. No one no thinking American wants to have a President of either party and any philosophy who cannot fully serve and does not fully do his job or her job. And so I did what I was hired to do by the American people. And I believe, as strongly as I can say, it was the right thing to do. It was the moral thing to do. And our children will have a better world because we have now stood against ethnic cleansing, and not only that, in this case, we are going to be able to reverse it and let those people go home. What is your analysis of why, for instance, the overwhelming majority of the Republicans in the House of Representatives did not vote to support this air war in the beginning? Oh, I do not know. I prefer to be grateful for those who did support it. And quite a number did. And we had very good support, a minority of Republicans in the Senate, but a substantial number supported us in a very vocal and effective way and were prepared to go even further to ground forces, as you know. So I am grateful for the support that we did have. A lot of very serious, thoughtful Republicans said they thought we were doing the right thing. Speaker Hastert voted with us, and I would remind you that we got a very good vote early on, with the help of the Speaker, for the deployment of American forces in a peacekeeping operation. And then they voted to support the troops and to fund the air war. So I am grateful for that, and I leave it to others to interpret why they did what they did. Senator Hagel, Republican from Nebraska, who voted for He did. when it was in the Senate, was asked why there were so many Republicans who were not supporting this, and he said it had to do with trust. And he said, quote, This President has debased the one currency we each have in this business, and that is trust, and he will never get it back, end quote. That is what his explanation as to why Congress did not support you any more than they did. I think that is pretty self-serving: I am not going to do what is right for my country because I do not like Bill Clinton. You know, that is I think that is pretty self-serving. You know, I was gratified when, a few years ago, a historian of the Presidency said that I had kept a higher percentage of my commitments to the American people than any of the last five Presidents who preceded me an academic man at the time I'd never even met. And so I think that that element of the party devoted the better part of 7, 8 years almost now 7 years, more than 7 years to attacking me personally because they knew the American people agree with my ideas and the direction in which I was taking the country. And on one occasion, much to my eternal regret, I gave them a little ammunition. But I have been trustworthy in my public obligations to the American people, and I have been trustworthy in my dealings with them. I have I do not agree with them, and when I do not , I tell them. But you know, we have gotten quite a lot done when they have put aside their personal frustration in not owning the White House. The truth is, those folks ought to lighten up. They believe they had they say a lot of my Republican friends, you know, they rail against the entitlement programs. They do not like the entitlement programs. But the truth is, for a long time they thought the White House was an entitlement program. They never thought there would be another Democratic President in their lifetime. And they are all gearing up again because they think they are entitled to the parking spaces outside here and to the office space and all. And this job here and this house, it does not belong to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party. The American people own this place. And we are all just here for a little while. And they ought to just relax and realize I am a temporary tenant and that we are all hired hands. And we ought to work for the American people, do our best, have the elections, and then let the people make their decision and go on again. I think that is what a lot of this is. They were they have just been mad ever since I won because a lot of them really never believed there would be another Democrat in their lifetime. And attacking if you cannot beat somebody on the ideas and the issues and the philosophy and the direction of the country and if the country is doing very well, so you just get madder and madder when the country does well, then all you have left is a personal attack and say, Oh, I just do not trust the guy. But that is not good for America. And you know, I do not attack them personally. I am not going to get into it. My door is always open; my phone is always open; and I am going to keep working with them in every way I can. Since, just in the last 24 hours, since this thing has come to this critical concluding point, people who were criticizing this action, not just Republicans but pundits and people in the foreign policy establishment, they are still criticizing you. They does that surprise you? Gosh, no. I find that in Washington, in this sort of, what Professor Deborah Tannen has called this culture of critique, if I make a mistake, people want me to admit that I made a mistake. And I have tried to do that. I think it is quite therapeutic. It is hard to do, and I had to get hit upside the head to do it. But I did it, and it was good for me. But if they turn out to be wrong, they just change the subject or just keep insisting that it was, you know, just a fluke. I think the most important thing is, were we right to take a stand in Kosovo against ethnic cleansing? Were we right to do it more quickly that we did in Bosnia? Should we set up have a principle that guides us which says: Okay, in a world where people are fighting all the time over racial or ethnic or religious problems, we cannot tell everybody they have got to get along; we cannot stop every fight, like the fight between Eritrea and Ethiopia, or the struggles in Chechnya; but where we can, at an acceptable cost that is, without risking nuclear war or some other terrible thing we ought to prevent the slaughter of innocent civilians and the wholesale uprooting of them because of their race, their ethnic background, or the way they worship God? I think that is an important principle, myself. I think it is a noble thing. I think the United States did a good thing. Now, they may argue that I did it went about it in the wrong way. They may I have answered that, I hope. At least I am confident that I did the right thing in the right way. And that is what historians can judge that based on the long-term consequences of this. But I believe what we did was a good and decent thing. And I believe that it will give courage to people throughout the world, and I think it will give pause to people who might do what Mr. Milosevic has done throughout the world. I feel awful that we were not equipped and able and on the job to stop what happened in Rwanda. And since then, I have done everything I could to train this Africa Crisis Response team, military from different countries in Africa, so that if that starts again God forbid somewhere, they can move in and stop it. I think the world the freedom-loving nations of the world need to be organized to try to stop this sort of thing. I mean, do not you think it is interesting that we are on the verge of a new century, and you are going to have all these millennial celebrations, and we are all going to talk about how 100,000 websites get added to the Internet every day, and we are going to unlock the mysteries of the human gene, and what a modern, rapid world we are going to be living in, and here we are bogged down everywhere in the world by the oldest problems of human society: We fear people who are different from us; pretty soon we hate them; once we start hating them, we dehumanize them; then it is easy to kill them. Now, it seems to me if we are going to reap the promise of the 21st century, if we do not want to go to Europe or some other place and have a bunch of Americans die in a bloody war, where we can nip this stuff in the bud we ought to do it. And that is what I have tried to do. And I think it was the right thing to do. As we sit here right now, ENTITY, is this the best moment of your Presidency? Oh, no, I would not say that. I do not know you know, there is so many things that have happened here at home that have been important to me, passing the economic plan, passing the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. So many things have happened internationally, the role that I was fortunate to be able to play in the peace process in the Middle East and in Ireland. But this could have the biggest long-term positive consequences if we do it right. But frankly, I have not sometimes people say, Well, do you feel vindicated? The answer is no. I think America has been vindicated. I think what we stand for has been vindicated. But keep in mind, there have been lots of times in the past where people win a conflict and then squander the peace. So a lot of our work is still ahead of us. We have got to get those folks home. We have got to get those landmines up. We have got to work out these details on who is going to be involved in this peacekeeping mission. We then have to get this we have got to organize police forces and a civil government for the Kosovars. And then the really big thing over the long run our European friends want to take the lead in this, but we ought to help them we have got to get the World Bank and all these other people involved in a development plan for the Balkans that involves not just Kosovo but Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and, I hope some day, Serbia, if they have a government that respects freedom and democracy and human rights, so that these people have something pulling them together instead of these ancient ethnic troubles pulling them apart. Now, if we get all that done, it might be perhaps the most satisfying thing because it might prove that people can lay down their hatreds of people who are different. I basically think free people will figure out a way to make the most of their lives and work out their problems if they can get the rules of engagement right. That is why I gave somewhat of an extended answer to what you said about the Republicans, because I think you know, differences are good. Nobody's got the whole truth. But you have got to get the rules of engagement right. And I think what we did in Kosovo was profoundly important. ENTITY, thank you very much.

{"id": 441, "text": "In nine months in office, you have already accomplished more in the way of job creation. The move in the equities markets has been extraordinary and record setting. All of the indexes, at or near record levels. You have accomplished so much in that nine months. And yet, as you say, we need tax reform. You are meeting resistance from within your own party. You are meeting resistance from the Democrats. How do you move from here? Well, I think we are going to get it. I think these Senators are going to come together. I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are passing this bill along very rapidly. In fact, that is going to happen hopefully today. And I did make a couple of calls. I said -- fellas, please, no changes. Just pass it along. We have to get tax cuts. And just pass it along. We have to get tax cuts. And just pass it along. Now normally, they want to make their 15 points or their 20 points and then it has to go back and it has to be re-voted and everything else. I said just pass it along. And they said think we are going to do that. And let us see what happens. But I think they are going to do that. And so look, we have actually in the Republican Party, in a true sense, we have great unity. Look at the Democrats with Bernie Sanders who got absolutely taken advantage of by the DNC. And now see it, you know, all the stuff coming out. You see worse happening. But you look at Hillary and Bernie, that is big league stuff. We have very, very minor -- we have great unity. I was with the Senate yesterday, the entire Republican Senate. And other than two people, I tell you, there was a lot of love in that room. A lot of love and a lot to get done. A lot to get done. Yes. And -- and the -- and tax reform is critical because of what you have established as the standard now for economic growth under the Trump presidency, tax reform is going to be absolutely critical to driving that growth, job creation and bringing capital back, which you have been talking about for two years before you were elected -- For many years. Absolutely. Many years before. So where do we go, in terms of capital repatriation for corporate America, how do you incentivize corporations to get back to America with all of that money for investment in jobs, plant equipment, research and development? So we have many things. Number one, we are bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. That is a massive -- this will be the biggest tax -- Right. ...cut in history. In the history of our country. And that is great. And we need it. Because right now, our country's about the highest taxed or certainly one of the highest taxed in the world. And we cannot have that. So we are going to have a country that is toward the lower end. I cannot say it is the lowest. You know, Ireland is going now lower and others are going lower. They played the game a lot better than our people have played the game, I can tell you that. But we are going to have a country that is going to have tax incentive now. And we are going to bring back -- you know, I have been talking and I even heard you say it not so long ago -- two and a half trillion. But you and I have both been using that number for years. A conservative number That number is much higher now, because it is , you know, built up over the years. And I would be surprised if it were not close to $4 trillion. That money's coming back. And nobody would bring it back now because the tax is so astronomical, they'd have to be desperate to bring it back. I mean any company that would bring it back and pay the tax that they have to pay, which probably ends up being close to 40 percent, who is going to pay that to bring money back in? So what they do is they leave their money in these other places and other countries and they spend it there and they create a lot of additional wealth there. We want the money coming back here. But it could be $4 trillion. And what we are doing is substantially lowering the tax. And we are also getting rid of all the bureaucratic hurdles. It was not just the tax. I have friends that want to bring money back. The amount of work they have to do to get the approval to bring the money back is absolutely ridiculous. So that is going away also. And the middle class -- you say this is for the middle class and small business and the pass-through rates are all very attractive. What do you expect the impact to be for working men and women, the middle class, those who aspire to be in the middle class? You know, we have done so well. Pretty much record setting, certainly record setting for nine months in so many different ways. Nine months of a presidency. But you look at the market, how well it is doing, so you'd say well why do you have to do anything. We can actually do better. And I think we will do better. We are going to have so many jobs created by what we are doing. And you know, we are going to have companies that are not going to be leaving our country anymore. You look at what is happened over the last 25 years, you go down and take a look at Mexico -- Right. -- and see how many car companies have built these massive factories in Mexico. Not here. We want them built in Michigan, and Ohio, and our places. And they just leave, and they fire everybody, and they go and open up plants. That is not going to be happening anymore, plus they are going to be penalized in many different ways if they do it. Well you are the first ENTITY to talk openly and honestly about offshoring of production, the outsourcing of jobs. Millions of jobs -- It is terrible. that -- that have begun, under your administration, to come back to the country. The idea that made in America, buy in America, hire in America, how -- how likely is it that that can actually be realized with a -- with a business community that has fought those on the wrong side of those issues for a very long time? Well you are right, and it is surprising to me. For instance, NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever. It is just one of the worst. Although TPP, which I terminated before it got signed -- before it got finished, someday hopefully people will be thanking. That would have been one of the great disasters of all times, in terms of trade. -- Right. And a lot of people understand that, but a lot of people do not . But I was very honored to have just terminated that. And we will do bilateral deals with all those countries. We will do it great. And if they do not do -- treat us properly, we will do a termination or we will do whatever we want to do. These deals, once you get into them -- How likely is it that there will be a resolution on NAFTA in these current negotiations? -- OK. So I would say this. In order to have a resolution -- because right now, Mexico and Canada have such a great deal -- it is so good that it is very hard for them to get used to the fact that it cannot be that way anymore. And as you know, Mexico has an election coming up and they have a number of people that are running and they are very pro Mexico. Which is -- in fact, they wore a hat -- a green hat that says, Make Mexico Great Again. They call them -- they call them the Donald Trump of politics. They have a couple of them, actually. And it is very hard. I said, you -- you negotiate -- I tell my people. I say, right now, it is going to be very hard. And in my opinion, in order to make a fair deal with NAFTA, you have to terminate the deal and you have to see where you are going to come. And we will come out But I think you have to give them -- to make a fair deal and a great deal, and you see what is going on, we are being very tough and we are being very fair. But we have to get back a lot. What is happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable. The jobs that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is incredible. So what are the chances? I think the chances, ultimately, are good. But right now, I think my people are going to have to get tougher. And -- And I told them that. So as you look at the agreement that has, by the most conservative estimates, costs the United States $1 trillion over the course of -- over the course of the past 23 years since its inception -- But look at it a different way. OK. We have a trade deficit with Mexico. -- Right. Mexico's wonderful. But we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $71 billion a year. This is Mexico. We were not talking about China, which is much worse. -- Right. We have a trade deficit right now with Mexico of $71 billion. People cannot believe it. -- There was a -- That we have trade deficits -- well, we have trade deficits with almost everybody. -- Every -- But we are changing that. The -- when you focus first on free trade, people are like -- oh, my gosh. He is talking like an isolationist, -- It is unbelievable. a protectionist. And then they started looking at the numbers to see that we are, amongst all of our trading partners that this country is the only one who said, You know, please, take what you want. We do not have to have a mature, intelligent relationship with you. We do not have to have balanced trade. Every other major partner does precisely that. The WTO, World Trade Organization, was set up for the benefit for everybody but us. Right. They have taken advantage of this country like you would not believe. And I say to my people, you tell them, like as an example, we lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO -- within the WTO. Because we have fewer judges than other countries. It is set up as you cannot win. In other words, the panels are set up so that we do not have majorities. It was set up for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States. NAFTA and I tell people and I tell good people, they hear me -- I am going to be very tough with NAFTA. But they hear I am getting tough with -- they said 'please do not touch it.' I say, listen. I am going to make the detail better. 'Oh, do not touch it.' I said, supposing I do not terminate it, but I make it better. 'Oh, do not touch it.' And I say, why would they not want me to make it better? Even if assuming you leave it the way it is, which we may or we may not. It depends how the negotiation turns out. We may not. But look, they do not even want you to touch it, even if you tell them, we are going to make it better. Then you say to yourself, what is going on. And then you say, well they must be on the other side of the deal too. And they are. They have companies that have factories in Mexico. U.S. But I am not interested in them, I am interested here. The role of business in this country, critical, off fundamental to the -- to the country's wellbeing and its future to the creation of jobs. But business has taken such a voice in this town, in this swamp that you are the only countervailing influence to that dominance of U.S. multinationals in this country. And it is -- the country owes you a great debt on so much. But on that in particular. And I -- That is very interesting. It is well put. It is true. And you have focused from June 16th of 2015 on the relationship of our borders, our sovereignty, our economy, whether you are looking at the opioid crisis in this country or the import of drugs that all crosses that border. You are being pushed back against, by the leadership of the House and the Senate on the issue of funding a wall in its entirety. You have been pushed back against talking about changing all of those trade agreements, again, all the external issues that are so critical to the country's future, your vision for this country. How in the world are we going to be able to deal with all of these issues if you -- if you cannot bring the Republican party together? I really think they are coming along. I really do. I think they are coming along. One thing you did not mention which you will mention and I know you talk about it is the power of the pharmaceutical companies. Oh, yes. We pay so much more for the same pill, prescription drugs than other countries. You go to Canada -- people go to Canada to buy prescriptions. We pay for the exact same pill, made from same plant, the same company, we pay in many cases, many, many times more than they are paying in other countries. So we are subsidizing the world in terms of prescription drugs. It is ridiculous. And it is going to stop. The problem I have is these companies give so much -- I mean the contributions are massive, just massive, the amount. But we do have -- there are a lot of good people that are seeing what is going on. And I think we will be successful in that. Next week, I am going to declaring an emergency, national emergency on drugs. The opioid is a tremendous emergency, what is going on there. The drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I tell you what, we have made a big impact. But still, we need the wall. You know, part of the reason we need the wall is for drugs. For drugs? Forgetting even about people, we need a wall for drugs. And the wall's coming along. You know, we are building right now prototypes. We have six prototypes. I am going to be looking at them over the next three weeks. Do you have a favorite yet? Well, you know, it is funny. It is very interesting. Almost glad you asked because it is actually pretty easy to understand. You think of a wall as a wall. But honestly you do need some see through ability because you do not know who is - if you do pure concrete which is a wall then you cannot see who is on the other side. You know you have a wall that is this thick and you cannot see who is on the other side. So, we are going to need some see through abilities. So, I am going to be going down. We actually have six prototypes that are all very top of the line. Done with Homeland Security. We have some incredible people, if you look at the Border Patrol, if you look at the ICE agents and I have had - Tough job. But I have had the people at that level. Those are the people, they know so much. They know more than anybody and they also know the wall and the wall systems. And, we are going to take a look at the wall and we are going to get it built and it is going to be - it is going to be quite the wall. It is going to be very effective. You are obviously enthused about what you are going to get done. You have got to be immensely gratified at what you have been able to do often with a recalcitrant Congress and Senate. Going forward, there is another wall and there is a wall that is just fallen between the American public, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Right. They funded something called the Trump dossier which they ballyhooed for some time. We now know who paid for it. The DNC and Hillary Clinton and one, as yet, unnamed republican. Do you want to - Wonder who that might be? Do you have a suspect? I think I know but you know I will let them find out. They are going to find out eventually just like they did - do not forget Hillary Clinton totally denied this. She did not know anything. She knew nothing. All of a sudden they found out. What I was amazed at, it is almost $6 million that they paid and it is totally discredited, it is a total phony. I call it fake news. Right. It is disgraceful. It is disgraceful. I think her word that she likes to use, it is so serviceable about that dossier, debunked. It is been debunked. And then, I understand recently she said well opposition research. Opposition research is very standard. So, it is very interesting, she denied it, her own people denied it. Everybody denied it and now they are sort of scooting around trying to figure out what to say. So, they spent, if you think of it, almost $6 million on something like that and I think honestly I just think it is a disgrace. And, contemporaneously, suddenly the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight Committee are turning to the Democratic Party and talking about - not talking about but beginning the investigation of something called Collusion with the Russians. That is the real collusion. Believe me. You r thoughts? There was no collusion on my side. I can tell you that. Everybody knew it. You knew it because you were saying it when it was not in vogue but I always said and I had no idea how right I was because I did not realize it would be for this extent. Right. But I always said this was an excuse for losing the election put out by the democrats and that is what it was. But then when you hear the kind of money they spent and when you see all of the things about Podesta and you see all of the relationships that they actually have with Russia and you see in hers. You know one thing that is interesting and I have to say even the democrats they walk out of those meetings and they say no there is no collusion and we have not found any yet but we will keep going. Right. A wonderful man came to my office a week ago. A very highly respected man and he sat down and he said, You know it is been very unfair. From the day you have been president you have been under this little veil of Russia, Russia, Russia. And with all of this being said, I want to say this, I think it would be great if we got along with Russia. I do not think there is anything wrong with - you know they are a power, they are a nuclear power. I think we could have a good relationship. I think that North Korean situation would be easier settled. And I just spoke to the President of China, I congratulated him on his big victory. But it would be wonderful if we could speak to China and Russia. Because China is helping us and maybe Russia's going through the other way and hurting what we are getting. I mean when I say maybe, I think I know exactly what I am talking about. If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing. Relationships -- you were criticized for even trying to court, if you will, President Xi of China. Everyone, the so-called intelligentsia of this country's foreign policy establishment, said you are wasting your time, it just cannot be done. And obviously you have made significant progress with him and -- Just spoke to him a few minutes ago, just before I walked into the room. You know, something has been given to him that is never been -- Right. -- it is really virtually never happened in China. He is been given powers that nobody's -- -- written into the constitution. He is a powerful man. I happen to think he is a very good person. Now with that being said, he represents China, I represent the USA, so, you know, there is going to always be conflict. But we have a very good relationship. People say we have the best relationship of any president-president, because he is called president also. Now some people might call him the king of China. But he is called president. But we have a very good relationship and that is a positive thing. And it would be good to have that relationship with Russia and other countries, too. Hopefully the whole world. Anything to report to America on your conversation with President Xi? No, but I will be going there in two weeks. Right. And we are going to Beijing and other places, wherever he'd like to take me. And we will be spending two days there. And we are going also to Japan and South Korea. And it will be, I think -- hopefully it is historic and positive and we have to solve the North Korea problem. It is a very big problem. It should have never been given to me. This should have been solved long before I came to office, when it would have been easier to solve. But it was given to me and I get it solved. I solve problems. I am very happy with the way the markets are going, I am very happy with all of the regulation cuts and all of the things we have done and that is what is driving the markets. You are nearing a decision on who will chair the fed. I am. Any hints? So I really have it down to two and maybe three people. And I think over the next very short period of time I will be announcing it. It will not be a big shock. It was sort of interesting, the way it comes out. And you have been talking about the various people on your show, which I watch absolutely almost all the time, even if it means TiVo or whatever device you happen to be using at the time. We appreciate it. But no, your show is fantastic. So I will be announcing this role over the next pretty short period of time. All right. And you -- Do you have a preference, out of curiosity? I do, and -- Tell me who your preference is. I think I -- may I constrain myself? Yes. Because an ad hoc advisor to the president -- No, but I'd love to hear it. You could even cut it out if you want. You do not have to -- I would love to hear you. I only want that from people I respect. I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping. I tell you what, she was in my office three days ago. She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it is somebody that I am thinking about. I would certainly think about it. In one way, I have to say -- I have not been utterly rejected -- No, no. In one way, I have to say you'd like to make your own mark. Right. You understand that. Absolutely. You like to make your own mark, which is maybe one of the things she is got a little bit against her. But I think she is terrific. We had a great talk. And we are obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets. And I am saying that, by the way, not being any fan of interest rate hikes by the fed here, and as has been discussed since December of 2015. I have to ask you in conclusion -- and I really appreciate your time, as does our audience -- you came into this job fighting like hell. And you are fighting like hell every day. -- More than I thought. I -- I -- that is -- I came in. I said I am going to fight like hell. I did not realize -- I had -- it is even more -- more so than I thought. But that is the way it is. And that is good. And I have got to ask you, I mean, you are one of the most -- I would say, by the left particularly, reviled, even hated men to ever hold your post. -- I would say so. You are also one of the most loved and respected -- I would say that also. in history. And how does that feel? How -- where is Donald Trump today, as you are just now beginning your presidency? So the one thing that I really thought -- because I thought I was treated very unfairly by the press during the campaign. -- Without question -- And when I won, I said, The good news is, now they will start treating me well. But they got much worse. Right. Lou, they put on stories and CNN, and on NBC, and CBS, and ABC, and NBC being an offshoot also with the MSNBC, which is ridiculous. They put on stories that are so false. They have so-called sources that, in my opinion, do not exist. You know, they will say, Sources have said, they do not know. They are sitting down, they just -- they make it up. It is so dishonest. It is so fake. And you know, I have come up with some pretty good names for people. There is -- I think one of the best names is -- you know, I have really started this whole fake news thing. Now they have turned it around and then, now they are calling, you know, stories put out by different -- by Facebook fake. And they are fake. What could be more fake than CBS, and NBC, and ABC, and CNN when you look at some of these stories? And when you look at the amount of negative -- I know when I do well and when I do badly. -- Right. I know a good story from a bad story. But when you have a really good story and they make it bad, I will say to my wife, Oh, tonight, I am going to enjoy watching television because I did great, and wait until you see this. And then, they put it on and it is like -- oh, that is not so good. They are fake news. And the good thing about social media is that I have so many millions of people, so many -- I guess, 128 million. You could add up -- you know, you add up all the different platforms -- massive social media. At least I can put out -- it is not that I want to do that. I'd rather not do it. I would love to not do it at all. But at least I can put out the truth. And I can put out the real word. And people agree. And if you look at the level of approval of the -- of media -- of general media -- Right. if you look at it from the day I started running to now, I am so proud that I have been able to convince people how fake it is -- because it has taken a nosedive. -- Yes. And -- Except for your show, of course -- and Sean, and a few of them. Right? Yes. There is some very good ones. And I have to say, Fox has treated me fairly. And I do not mean good, but they have treated me fairly. I do not want to be treated good. I just want to be treated fairly. Well -- I -- you -- you are a, if I may say, everything as advertised as you ran for President. And appreciate everything you are doing. Thanks so much. We are getting it done. I will promise you, we are getting it done. And it is happened -- a lot has already happened. Thank you very much, it is an honor. ENTITY, thank you. Thank you.

{"id": 318, "text": "Good afternoon. Today I'd like to update you all on where we stand on COVID-19. Because of the strategy we executed over the past year on vaccinations, testing, treatments, and more, we are now in a new moment in this pandemic. It does not mean that COVID-19 is over, it means that COVID-19 no longer controls our lives. That is what it means. Cases are ticking up, as we thought they might. But now, thanks to the foundation we have laid, America has the tools to protect people all the people. And you know, as we have done on from day one, my administration is making it easier than ever for Americans to access these tools. Today I am announcing the launch of COVID.gov COVID.gov a one excuse me, a one-stop shop where anyone in America can find what they need to navigate the virus: free vaccines and boosters, free at-home tests, high-quality masks. And for the latest information about the level of COVID-19 spread in your community, you can get that immediately. Now, you will also be able to find our new test-to-treat locations, which I announced in my State of the Union Address. These are pharmacies and other places in your neighborhood where you can get tested. And if you are positive, you can get lifesaving treatments all in one stop. We have already stood up 2,000 test-to-street sites test-and-treat sites across the country. We are also nearly at we have nearly 200 sites just to serve military families and veterans communities as well. We have done what we have done throughout the pandemic, we have ensured there are these locations are at the hardest hit, hardest to reach communities as well. The bottom line: No longer will Americans have to scour the internet to find vaccines, treatments, tests, or masks. It is all there. And just go visit COVID.gov COVID.gov. And let me remind you: When I took office about 14 months ago, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling, and the deficit was soaring. Most schools were closed. We did not have enough vaccines. The unemployment claims were sky high. And then we got to work, and we delivered: enough vaccines for every American months ahead of schedule, effective treatments, at-home tests that are free and accessible. Over 99 percent of our schools are open again. Businesses are open again. And because of how we responded, we created more jobs last year than ever before: 6.7 million jobs. And by the way, we did it while cutting the deficit, the largest 1-year deficit reduction in American history. Say that again: The largest 1-year deficit reduction in American history. But none of that happened by accident. We were able to do it because we coordinated across the Government, partnered with State and local leaders, Governors on both sides of the aisle, and the private sector to leverage every resource we had to fight against this virus. We left no stone unturned. And we were able to do it because Congress worked with us and provided us the necessary funding. But now, just as we have reached the critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight COVID-19. We are already seeing the consequences of congressional inaction. The monoclonal antibodies take monoclonal antibodies, for example. They have helped save lives. This is not partisan, it is medicine. But Congress has not provided enough money to keep purchasing these monoclonal antibodies. We have had to cancel planned orders and cut the supply we are sending to the States. Without more funding, we will start to run out of them by the end of May the end of May. We have also had to scale back our plan to purchase more preventive therapies for Americans who are immunocompromised, critical tools to protect the most vulnerable among us. Without more funding, we risk running out of the supply by this fall. The same is true of testing. It took months to ramp up our testing capacity. The Omicron we saw how vital and with Omicron, we saw how vital it was and * we have enough tests on hand to weather the surge. But without funding, we are not going to be able to sustain the testing capacity beyond the month of June. And if we fail to invest, we leave ourselves vulnerable if another wave of the virus hits. Look, on vaccines and most important tool in this fight we are also running a risk. Yesterday the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, authorized a fourth shot for those 50 years and older. We know boosters are critical to providing an additional level of protection. That is why I plan to get my second booster today right here after I am done speaking. If you have not gotten your first booster, please do not wait. Do it today. Those who are 50 and older, as well as those who are immunocompromised, can now get it get even more protection than they have from the initial first doses. We have enough supply to give booster shots to those newly eligible individuals. But if Congress fails to act, we will not have the supply we need this fall to ensure that shots are available, free, easily accessible for all Americans. Even worse, if we need a different vaccine for the future to combat a new variant, we are not going to have enough money to purchase it. We cannot allow that to happen. Congress, we need to secure additional supply now. Now. We cannot wait until we find ourselves in the midst of another surge to act. It will be too late. And we also need this funding to continue our efforts to vaccinate the world, with commitments we made. It is critical to our ability to protect against new variants. There is no wall that you can build high enough to keep out a virus. Congress needs to act now, please. Let me close with this: I have worked so hard to get our lives we have worked so hard to we, all of us, have worked so hard to get our lives back. We are summoning every ounce of American resilience; pulled every lever of our Government; called upon the goodness, decency, and patriotism of the American people; and together, we turned an unthinkable pain into an extraordinary progress and purpose. Americans are back to living their lives again. We cannot surrender that now. Congress, please act. You have to act immediately. The consequences of inaction are severe. They will only grow with time, but it does not have to be that way. We have proven what we can do when we work together. So I urge Democrats and Republicans to get this done with urgency. Let us stand united. Let us continue to pull together. Let us get this done. Thank you, and God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. And now I am going to get my second booster shot. I am not sure why I am doing it on stage. Just to prove I am getting it, I guess. ENTITY, what is the danger of Putin being left in the dark by his military advisers? I am reluctant to comment on that. Can you comment on the declassified intelligence that he does not trust his military leadership, since it is declassified? No, I cannot . ENTITY, is the U.S. willing to provide security guarantees to Ukraine as part of peace talks? I am feeling great. Is the U.S. willing to provide security guarantees to Ukraine as part of peace talks with Russia? ENTITY, are you going to extend title 42? We will have a decision on that soon. ENTITY, what did President Zelenskyy tell you about the ENTITY, the difference between rich and poor countries on vaccination will impact your the fight against COVID here? I am sorry What did President Zelenskyy say to you about The difference between the gap Somebody asked about the vaccines, which is relevant. For kids under 5, is there are there enough funds to provide them vaccines for free? How does it feel, ENTITY? ENTITY Wonderful. ENTITY, what did today about negotiations with Russia? ENTITY, are there enough funds to provide vaccines for kids under 5? No, I have to admit to you, I have always thought that it discourages people getting a vaccination when they watch people get a needle in their arm. So I apologize if I discouraged them. It did not hurt a bit, and I was able to roll my sleeve up. And thank you all so very much. Will you meet with Trevor Reed's parents? Will you meet with Trevor Reed's parents, ENTITY, while they are here in Washington? They say that you promised them a meeting. I am going to see if I can get to see them. They are good Today? They are good people. I have not we are trying to work that out.

{"id": 326, "text": "ENTITY, a lot of people say this might be your first trip to London, but it is not. No, it is not. I have been there a couple of times. I remember, Laura and I went to see Cats in London. Gosh, I remember going to some nice pubs when I was a drinking man in London. It is a great city, and I am looking forward to going. We are looking forward to seeing you there, too. In fact, of course, you are famous for the fact that normally social- dressing up socially is not your favorite thing, and you once said that marvelous quote, Read my lips: No new tuxes. That is right. Are you going to take a new tux this time? I am going to take a tux, and I am going to take tails. And do not tell anybody, but I had to rent them. I am sure you will not tell anybody. This is entirely between us. I am looking forward to- it is a huge honor to be invited by Her Majesty to stay in Buckingham Palace. It is hard to imagine me even considering staying in Buckingham Palace when I was living in Midland, Texas. It is just one of those things. And Buckingham Palace has got a tremendous mystique to it, and so Laura and I are really looking forward to coming. And you pinch yourself about those things too. What would you like to see come out of this trip in terms of- in addition to the fun part? Well, I have got some business to do with Tony Blair. We have got a lot of things to discuss. We are going to talk about how to continue to spread freedom and peace. We will talk about how to work the compassion agenda on the AIDS Initiative, for example. We are going to spend some time talking about that. I value his advice, and I-every time I visit with him, whether it be on the phone or on video or in person, I come away with a-some interesting ideas about how to advance a positive agenda. Secondly, I look forward to speaking to the people of your great country. I am going to have a chance to give a speech to talk about the importance of our relationship, the unique relationship between America and Great Britain. And I will have a chance to answer some questions, I am sure, from what we call the Fourth Estate here, the mighty media. I look forward to it. And Tony Blair on Monday night-and he would probably have told you-is expecting there to be quite a lot of protesters about the war. What would be your message to those protesters? Well, freedom is a beautiful thing, I would first say, and are not you lucky to be in a country that encourages people to speak their mind. And I value going to a country where people are free to say anything they want to say. Secondly, I would say that I understand you do not like war, and neither do I. But I would hope you understand that I have learned the lessons of September the 11th, 2001, and that terrorists declared war on the United States of America and war on people that love freedom, and I intend to lead our Nation, along with others like our close friends in Great Britain, to win this war on terror, that war is my last choice, not my first choice, but I have an obligation as the ENTITY to keep our country secure. And at the same time, you will be working with Tony Blair, and what is the key to your working together so well? I mean, it is like you have a special relationship. Is partially the bond, the bond that you are both men of strong faith? I think so. Tony is a man of strong faith. You know, the key to my relationship with Tony is he tells the truth, and he tells you what he thinks, and when he says he is going to do something, he is going to do it. I trust him, therefore. I have seen him, under some tough-tough circumstances, stand strong, and I appreciate that in a person. The other thing I admire about Tony Blair is that he is got a vision beyond the current. In other words, he can see a world that is peaceful, and he agrees with me that the spread of democracy and freedom in parts of the world where there is violence and hatred will help change the world, that there are reformers in the Middle East that long for democracy, that long to live in a free world. And Tony Blair, like me, agrees-kind of rejects the elitist point of view that only a certain type of person can adapt the habits of freedom and democracy. And he knows that freedom in the Middle East will help change that world in dramatic fashion. So it is an historic moment which he has been willing to seize, and I am honored to be working with him to seize the moment. And in terms of as you look at the world, ENTITY, at the moment and you see the protesters in Australia or wherever they are and you see that poll that came out, an EU poll the other day that shows that the United States was second among the most dangerous countries in terms of war in the world-level, for God's sake, with North Korea and Iran- when you see things like that, do you think the world is out of step with America, or America is out of step with the world? Well, first of all, you have got to know, I do not pay attention to the polls. I just do not . I have got a job to do for the American people. It is a job that was changed on September the 11th, 2001, and I refuse to-I refuse to forget-I will never forget the lessons, is a better way to put it, of what happened to this country. And there are terrorists who are willing to kill innocent life in order to create fear and chaos. There are terrorists who want the free world to retreat from duties so that they can impose Taliban-type governments and enslave people. There are people like Saddam Hussein, who tortured and maimed and killed and, at the same time, threatened and created the conditions of instability. And I know some people do not understand the need to deal with that, but I feel firmly we must deal with those issues. But do you need to woo people more in the rest of the world? We wooed-we did a pretty good job of wooing them at the United Nations. After all, remember, 1441 was a unanimous vote that said, after a decade of sending messages to Mr. Saddam Hussein for him to disarm, 1441 said, Disarm or there will be serious consequences. And that was a unanimous vote. In other words, the world, at least the Security Council, came together and sent a clear signal. Obviously, there was a disagreement about the definition of serious consequence. But I can assure you, serious consequence is not more resolutions or more debate. Serious consequence was with dealing with Mr. Saddam Hussein today, before it became too late. And I understand people do not agree with that position. But nevertheless, I am convinced that the decisions we made- and there is a lot of countries that made that decision with us-that decision will make the world more peaceful and more free. That decision is in the long-term interests of people who love freedom. And will you ever be able to forgive Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Schroeder for their actions of that time in undermining the second resolution? Of course. It is like, I can understand why people express their disagreement with the policy. I understand not everybody is going to agree with every decision that I make or others make. But I have had meetings with Gerhard Schroeder and Jacques Chirac since then. They have been very cordial meetings. Gerhard Schroeder has now committed German troops to Afghanistan, which is a very important mission, to help stabilize that good country as it not only enacts a constitution but heads toward elections. And I appreciate the contribution of the German Government toward Afghanistan. I am proud to say that it is a vital contribution, and I appreciate their willingness to work with us. Again, we are not going to agree on every issue, but a Europe which works closely with America and an America which works closely with Europe means the world will be better off. The difference really is, between Tony Blair and them, is that Tony Blair sees Europe as a partner of the United States, and they perhaps see Europe as a rival of the United States. I do not think Germany sees that, for starters. In my conversations with Gerhard Schroeder, they never yielded that impression. I think Germany understands it is important for the bilateral relationship between America and Germany to be strong. It is in our economic interests that it is strong. It is in the interest of peace that it be strong. I understand there was kind of this notion of multipolarity, which means that somehow the values of America need to be offset. But we are for peace; we are for freedom. This country is leading the world when it comes to fighting AIDS. And I can assure you, having studied this issue a lot, and I understand the pandemic of AIDS on the continent of Africa, we will be better off-the people of Africa will be better off if Europe and the United States work together to fight the pandemic of AIDS. My only point is, there is a lot we can do working together. And what about the-I gather that you have some misgivings about the proposed European army, the danger that it might be a threat to NATO. Yes, here is the thing, first of all, I believe that the European defense force ought to take on more responsibility on those missions which NATO turns down. I think it is good for the United States' interests. I think it is good for NATO's interests, so long as the defense force does not undermine the vitality of NATO. And Tony Blair tells me that the discussions he is having with other European countries will in no way undermine NATO, and I take his word for it. He is been a man who is been true to his word on a lot of issues, and I believe he will be true to his word on this issue. Tell me about-in terms of Iraq, tell me about weapons of mass destruction. The fact that we did not find them, and so on, has been much discussed. But do you think that you were the victim of a failure of intelligence in a way? Not at all. No? No, not at all. I think our intelligence was sound. I know the British intelligence was sound. It is the same intelligence that caused the United Nations to pass resolution after resolution after resolution. It is the same intelligence that was used by my predecessor to bomb Iraq. I am very confident we got good intelligence. And not only that, Mr. David Kay, who went over to kind of lead the effort to find the weapons or the intent of weapons, came back with a report that clearly stated that Mr. Saddam Hussein would-had been in material breach of Resolution 1441. In other words, had the inspectors found what Kay found, they would have reported back to the United Nations that he was in breach, that he was in violation of exactly what the United Nations expected him not to do. We will find the truth. But this guy for many years had been hiding weapons, deceiving weapons. He had dual-use programs that could have been sped up. Nobody could say that Saddam Hussein was not a danger. Not only was he a danger to the free world-and that is what the world said; the world said it consistently-he was a danger to his own people as well. Remember, we discovered mass graves with hundreds of thousands of men and women and children clutching their little toys, as a result of this person's brutality. Go ahead. Sorry. But in terms of-did you feel, in terms of if there was not a failure of intelligence, that there was a sort of exaggeration in what was predicted? I mean, did you ever believe that stuff, for instance? Did you ever believe that stuff about him having weapons of mass destruction that could be unleashed in 45 minutes, or did you never really believe that? I believe he was a dangerous man. But you did not believe that. Well, I believed a lot of things. But I know he was a dangerous man. And I know that for the sake of security, he needed to be dealt with. After all- again I repeat this because it is a very important point that people in your country must remember, and that is, the world had spoken, universally spoken, about this man's danger for 12 long years. And in order for-at the very minimum, in order for a multinational organization to be valid and effective, something has to happen other than resolutions. And when an organization says, If you do not disarm -in other words, in order to say, They do not disarm, intelligence convinced a lot of nations, including France, that he had weapons. In other words, he had to disarm something. Dismantle your programs. If you do not do that, there will be a serious consequence. And the fundamental question is, what is a serious consequence ? It is not another resolution. It is not more empty debate. A serious consequence, in this case, was removing Saddam Hussein so that his weapons programs would not be activated. And David Kay found evidence of weapons programs. He found some biological weapons-evidence of biological weapons. And it does not take much time-- But we really need the big discovery, do not we? Well, that is pretty big, what I just told you. Now remember, for a long period of time, it was assumed that he did not have a nuclear weapons program. And yet, after 1991, the world had to- changed its attitude about this man's nuclear weapons program and admitted that it was very advanced. A nuclear weapon in the hands of somebody like Saddam Hussein, particularly given the lessons of September the 11th, 2001, would be a horrendous development. And we had to deal with him. And we did-in a way, by the way, that was a compassionate way. We spared innocent life. We targeted the guilty, and we moved hard and fast. And very little of Iraq was touched in toppling Saddam Hussein. Did we, in fact-people have said, ENTITY, as you know, that the same meticulous planning that went into winning the war did not go into winning the peace, and we were a bit unprepared for some of the surprises, the unpleasant surprises, you know, the terrorists and all of that that came along. Is that a fair comment? No--it is not a fair comment. We look at all contingencies and are dealing with the contingencies. Look, let me-if I could step back and maybe think out loud here about some of the stories or some of the speculation that was going on before we went into Iraq: One, the oil revenues would be blown up; the oil fields would be destroyed. They were not . As a matter of fact, oil production is up to 2.1 million or 2.2 million barrels a day, to the benefit of the Iraqi people. That is a very important point. Remember, there was speculation about sectarian violence, that the long-suppressed Kurds or Shi'a may take out their anxieties and their frustrations on the Sunnis. That did not happen. There was talk about mass starvation; it did not happen. Refugee flows that would be unmanageable-that never happened. And so a lot of the contingency that we had planned for did not happen. What has happened is that in a relatively small part of the country, there are Ba'athist-- You call it now the Ba'athist Triangle. --Sunni Triangle, they are attacking. And they are attacking not only coalition forces; they are attacking innocent Iraqis, because what they are trying to do is stop the spread of progress. It is almost a guerrilla war there, really. Well, I would call it a desperate attempt by people who were totally in control of government, through tyrannical means, to regain power. This is nothing more than a power grab. Now, there are some foreign fighters, mujahideen types or Al Qaida or Al Qaida affiliates involved as well. They have got a different mission. They want to install a Taliban-type Government in Iraq, or they want to seek revenge for getting whipped in Afghanistan. But nevertheless, they all have now found common ground for a brief period of time. And what we will do is, we will use Iraqi intelligence; we will use Iraqi security forces-we are up to about 118,000 Iraqi folks in one type of uniform or another securing the country-to be a integral part of chasing these killers down and to bring them to justice before they kill innocent life. But it must have taken us a bit by surprise, or otherwise we'd have prepared for it, the level of this-the combination of the, what, 700, perhaps, foreign terrorists who came into Iraq, and so on. That was-- I do not think so. I think a lot the people who came in initially wish they had not come in initially, or they are not wishing at all right now. But no, we understood it was going to be tough. We have been there for 7 months, David, which seems like a long time, particularly giving the news cycles the way they are. I am certainly not complaining about the news cycles, but nevertheless, there is a certain sense of impatience that has now crept into the world. And my job is to enable our operators and military to make adjustments necessary to succeed. We have got the same strategy, which is a peaceful Iraq. The tactics shift, depending upon the decisions of the enemy. We are making progress. That is not to say it is not tough. Of course, it is tough. What they want to do is, they want to shake the will of the free world. And the good news about having a partner like Tony Blair is, he will not be shaken. And neither will I, and neither will Jose Maria Aznar. I heard Berlusconi stand up with a strong statement after the Italian police had been murdered. And we, of course, send our sympathies and prayers to the Italian people. But Berlusconi said, They are not going to run us out. And that is what these terrorists need to hear. And more importantly, or as importantly, the Iraqi citizens need to hear that. They need to know that we will not leave the country prematurely. They need to know two things: We are not going to cut and run; and two, we believe they have the capacity to run their own country. The cut-and-run thing, obviously, is absolutely vital. And you have said you are not going to cut and run. You will be there as long as it takes. Tony Blair, in his speech on Monday night, said, We are not going to retreat one inch. I mean, we are there for how long it takes to produce a successful Iraqi democracy, are we? Yes, absolutely. Whether that is years and years or what? Well, we do not think it will be years and years, because, first of all, we think the Iraqi people are plenty capable of running their own country, and we think they want to run their own country. And just today I had discussions with Jerry Bremer, our Ambassador in Baghdad, who flew back to discuss ways-- Oh, yes-- Well, just to discuss ways to do-to assure the Iraqi people that we have confidence in their capability. See, some in the world, some in the world do not believe that Iraq can run itself. They believe that, Might as well let them have a military dictatorship or a tyrant. That is the only way they can be governed. I disagree, and Tony Blair disagrees with that. We believe that democracy will take hold in Iraq, and we believe a free and democratic Iraq will help change the Middle East. There are hundreds of reformers that are desperate for freedom. Freedom- freedom is not America's gift to the world or Great Britain's gift to the world. Freedom is the Almighty's gift to everybody who lives in the world. Is there any likelihood that Saddam himself could be behind this violence? Saddam Hussein is a violent man. Listen, he tortured and maimed and killed. He had rape rooms, and people disappeared because they spoke out against him. We have discovered mass graves. He is a brutal, brutal tyrant-brutal tyrant. We did the Iraqi people a great favor by removing him. So I would not be surprised that any kind of violence is promoted by him, but I do not know. I do not know. All I know is, we are after him. That is one of the interesting things. I mean, nobody has time for a moment for Saddam Hussein. Some people are worried in England and around the world by the idea of regime change, because they say, Once we have done regime change, Britain and America with Saddam Hussein, what can we say if India wants to do regime change with Pakistan, or Pakistan wants to do regime change with India? Well, see, I can understand their concerns, except they forgot the history. This issue has been discussed in the United Nations for over a decade. And the United Nations, as a multilateral international body, passed resolution after resolution after resolution calling for Saddam Hussein to disarm. In other words, the diplomatic process went forward. There was plenty of diplomacy. And to the critics, I would say that there will be diplomacy when it comes to India and Pakistan. The world will speak out clearly. The problem is, is that when the world speaks out clearly and then nothing happens, all we have got is empty words. It is tyrants that take advantage of that. Tyrants- if tyrants do not fear-feel like they can torture and kill with impunity, feel like they can blackmail the world, and all the world does is put out empty words, it makes multilateralism extremely ineffective. If I could take a second to remind your viewers that, obviously, not every situation needs to be solved militarily. Military option is the last option, as far as I am concerned. And I would refer people to North Korea, where we have got a multilateral attempt to convince Kim Chong-il to get rid of his nuclear ambitions. We understand, just like Saddam Hussein, that he has been torturous to his people-people in North Korea are starving to death-and that weapons of mass destruction in his hands given his history, just like weapons of mass destruction in Saddam's hands given his history, is a very dangerous element. It is a dangerous-it inhibits the capacity for peace and freedom to spread. But what I have done is, I have convinced China and South Korea and Japan and Russia to speak with one voice to the North Koreans, and say, Get rid of your nuclear ambitions. We are also, at the same time, working on a counterproliferation regime that will stop his ability to ship weapons of mass destruction or a nuclear warhead to a terrorist group. In other words, we are working together in a multilateral, multinational fashion to bring peace and stability to the world. Someone who knows how passionate you are about this war on terror and Iraq and so on said, I know ENTITY, and I think, in terms of his legacy, he'd rather-I will tell you how strongly he feels. He said he'd rather be defeated by the voters than by the terrorists. Is that true? I'd rather not be defeated by either. And we will not be defeated by the terrorists. I say that confidently, because the allies in the war on terror are strong and steadfast, and there is no stronger and steadfast ally in the war on terror than Tony Blair. He understands the stakes. He knows that freedom is being challenged. He understands as well that the spread of freedom and democracy, in the long run, will defeat terror. And that is why the battle-the stakes are so high in Iraq right now. By the way, Iraq is a front in the war on terror. And it is important for people to understand that, because the war takes place elsewhere. And in-one of the reasons that people say, in the Arab world-obviously there was your landmark speech last week-but in the Arab world, that you will not really be able to address the balance against America until the United States is seen not to tilt towards Israel in the Middle East. What do you think about that? I think about that: I think it is an excuse, because America-I am the first ENTITY ever to go to the United Nations-- And say, two-- Two states side by side in peace. --two states. No President has ever said that. And I said it, and I said it with conviction, because I believe it is in Israel's interest that there be a peaceful Palestinian state, and I know it is in the Palestinians' interest. However, to achieve a peaceful Palestinian state, the emergence of a peaceful Palestinian state, a state where people are willing to risk capital, a place where people are willing to develop an economy, there must be a focused effort to defeat terror. And there has not been with the current Palestinian leadership. I went in and embraced, in Aqaba, Jordan, Abu Mazen. And the reason I did so, David, is because he came to the Oval Office and he said, I will join you in the fight against terror. We are not going to allow the few to destroy the hopes of the many. As well, I could sense in his talk, in his feeling, that he has-he is got great trust in the Palestinian people. In other words, given the chance, the Palestinian people will develop the habits of democracy, and out of that will come a great state, a peaceful state. And I trusted him, and we were working with him. We were making good progress. And I was working with Ariel Sharon. I gave a speech on June 24th, 2002, which says, All of us have responsibilities, and you, Israel, have a responsibility. Do you think Ariel Sharon could ever emerge as a man of peace? Yes, I do. I believe he wants peace for his people. I truly do. I mean, he is a man who has presided over suiciders, where he has to go to the funerals of women and children because some cold-blooded killer is trying to destroy the hopes of all the people in the region. And it is -yes, I believe so. And I believe he believes in a Palestinian state. I have asked him in the Oval Office, I said, Listen, am I out there by myself on a Palestinian state, or will you support it? He said he will. But both of us understand, as do a lot of other people, that for a state to emerge, there must be a focused effort to get after the Hamas killers, for example, who want to destroy the hopes of the people that believe in a Palestinian state. And there has not been that effort. Anyway, let me finish my Abu Mazen story, if you do not mind. I embraced the guy, and I believe that he is a-I believe he is a partner with whom we can work, and he is shoved out. Progress is being made, and he is shoved aside by the old guard. And that is unacceptable behavior. It is just unacceptable. Guantanamo. You are going to get asked about, obviously, in England, what is going to happen to our British detainees. Tony Blair was talking about it in the House of Commons this week and saying, hopefully they'd be tried before a proper court or repatriated to be tried in the U.K. Will you have any good news for us on that? For him on that? You mean right here, sitting right here, me and you, talking-the good news is, one, they will be treated fairly, like they are. And two, I am working closely with Tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with. And I emphasize, a solution that he is comfortable with. These prisoners are being treated-these were illegal non-combatants picked up off of a battlefield. And they are being well-treated, and they will go through a military tribunal at some point in time, which is-a military tribunal, which is in international accord- or in line with international accords. As we approach the end of this interview, ENTITY-I could carry on for hours, actually, but I know you have got a lot to do, more than the rest of us. As we approach the end of this interview, what would you say is the most important lesson you have learned in life in the Presidency? The most important lesson in life in the Presidency is to have a clear vision of where you want to lead, and lead. I have got a clear vision: It is a world that is more free and therefore more peaceful; a world based upon human rights, human dignity, and justice; a world that does not discriminate between one group of people or-a vision that does not discriminate between one group of people or another, because I believe all people have the desire to be free. And I am willing to lead there. And the people of this country will make their-you asked about politics-they will make the decision as to whether or not they-I have have been honest with them and open with them and whether or not they like my leadership style. A lot of it will have to do with the economy, of course, whether I get another 4 years. But I think it is important to know where you want to lead, and lead. Would you hope to present to the country the same team, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell and Condi Rice, for the second term? It is been a fabulous team, and Cheney for certain. And I have not -obviously, I am not going to talk to my Cabinet ministers until after the election. But I am proud of this team. I put together one of the finest teams, one of the finest administrations any President has ever assembled. These are good, honest, decent, hard-working, experienced people who give me good, unvarnished advice and, when I make a decision, say, Yes, sir, ENTITY, we will go execute it. Well, thank you for your decision to do this interview. Thank you, sir.

{"id": 13, "text": "Thank you all. Just a couple of comments. I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the American people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to America, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of American people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. And so thank you for coming. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from Benin. Yes, sir. First up. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on Saturday. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from America. You, President Bush, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the U.S. Government site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. What will be the implication of your trip to Benin, in terms of guaranteeing a perfect democracy for building hope and prosperity? Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of Benin have committed to democracy. However, to achieve a perfect democracy is very difficult. In my country, we are a great democracy. We were imperfect. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. One such problem in Benin is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. Today, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child 5 and under. That is a strong commitment. We have got what is called Millennium Challenge Account programs. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And Benin is such a country. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from Tanzania. I was happy to hear about you congratulating President Kikwete, calling him a good guy, because I agree he is a good guy as well. ] Well, actually, that is just Texas vernacular, you know, it is not a very--it is not diplomatic talk, but, you know--he is a good guy. He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the MCC money, which we are about to receive when you come down to Tanzania. Now my question is that Tanzania is among 15 countries that have benefited from the U.S. initiative on HIV/AIDS, PEPFAR program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as Tanzania develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has America made to ensure that developing countries such as Tanzania is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? That is good. First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why AGOA, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Today in my speech, I talked about this statistic: Exports to the United States from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from the United States to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. One way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the Doha round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. The United States has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the Congress and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. One way to do that is through OPIC. And I announced today a new multimillion dollar- hundreds of millions of dollars of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for African businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a one-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, 12 million textbooks and train 900,000 teachers and provide scholarships to 550,000 girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. ENTITY-- You are living in Rwanda now? Yes, I do. Good. And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. Thank you, sir. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your two mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the U.S. should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the U.S. and Africa? That is a very interesting question. A couple of approaches to aid in the past: One was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. The other approach oftentimes has been: You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is one way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. So we have taken this approach that said we will invest in countries where leadership has made a firm commitment to some basic principles: rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. In other words, there is a criterion to qualify for the money. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. There is nothing more debilitating to a society than corruption. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. There will be no trust in form of-any form of government. And so one of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. And my answer is, how can we not? Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing Africans than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old George wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. Thank you very much. I am fine. Yes, good, me too. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa today. Were you listening? Yes, for the-yes. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Why? The motivating factor of the interest in Africa. Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. Yes. A couple of things, ENTITY. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout 7 years. In other words, my speech today, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Secondly, there are two reasons why. Now, one, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of the United States. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. I mean, who would want to follow somebody that says: Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of the United States. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. America's generosity has been prevalent throughout the decades. And every time America reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those two premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like America could do something about it. Fifty thousand people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. Today, 1,300,000 people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. And it is not enough. It is just a beginning. And so you say, Why, ENTITY, do you feel that way? It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the American people to help. And the good news is, the American people have responded-$15 billion over 5. We are now going to double our commitment. Equally important, other nations have stepped up. The G-8 has committed to match the U.S. So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Patience. You have been very patient so far. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering Liberia as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. Yes, ma'am. And the Government and the people of Liberia do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, last year, your administration extended by 1 year the temporary protective status of hundreds of Liberians. Now what happens when you leave office? Yes. Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for Liberian refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these Liberians to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. Interesting; yes, thank you for that. I did extend TPS to Liberians here in America for, I think, 18 months. And there are no plans to make it permanent. I would hope that many of the Liberians who have come and been fine contributors here in America think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech today, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. ENTITY-- What kind of name is that, ENTITY? Actually, I am French, but it is a Celtic name. Really? Yes. That is a pretty name. The situation in Darfur has always been a matter of great concern for you. U.N. officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over the last few days. There is also been very heavy fighting in Chad. Do you think there is a link between the two, between Darfur and Chad? I do, yes. And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that the United States has called the situation in Darfur a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through the United Nations to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the Government. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were one time three are now a multiple of three. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in Khartoum chose not to do so. So the United States continues to work with the international community to put pressure on the Sudanese Government. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and Sudanese companies. I also did so against at least one rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. Some are reluctant to move; some are anxious to help. In terms of the conditions on the ground, one thing the United States has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at the United Nations that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. The question is, will the troops show up? One way I can help call the world to action is when I am in Rwanda to thank the troops of Rwanda, the Kagame Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the Sudan, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from 3 to more than 10-12, I think it is, or 18, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the U.S. and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in Darfur affects Chad and French interests. And I do thank the Sarkozy Government for being a responsible nation, rallying EU forces to come and provide some help. And it is a very unfortunate, sad situation that is frustrating. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President Mbeki as the honest broker in Zimbabwe. It looks like President Mugabe is a month away from being reelected. So what now? Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in Zimbabwe since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. Zimbabwe used to be a net exporter of food. Today, it is a net importer of food. Mr. Mugabe has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly Great Britain have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that the South African Government would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of Zimbabwe. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Thank you, ENTITY. Is that Jean ? ENTITY, I will-- Like they say Juan - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. Pineapples. Yes. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the American people to have a taste-. Yes, that is a smart move. That is good marketing. It is called a taste test. But yet, my country does not benefit much from-- From AGOA? Yes. Why? Because fruits are not a part of the AGOA-- Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under AGOA. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the AGOA trade list that can enter into the United States relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the AGOA but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. There are several ways the U.S. can help. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can OPIC, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to the United States for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And one of the things I am going to do in Ghana is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. And I am confident I am going to hear from leaders in the region saying: That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like AGOA, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. We expect there to be fairness. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including African nations. One of the things I point up to African leaders-point out to African leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from one African country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in America. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting Tanzania address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the MCC initiative and through the Threshold Program. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- That is a good question. --it will not end with you. You are right; my Presidency does end. And that is one of the great things about American democracy: There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of Tanzania that today's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. It is a very interesting question. I mean, you know, today's concern about corruption may not be tomorrow's. I suspect any American President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. ENTITY-- Your thing turned off there, by the way, Yvonne. It clicked off. I think yours did. Anyway, far be it for me to interfere with your-- ENTITY, you will see when you visit Rwanda that 14 years later, after the genocide, Rwanda has incredibly developed. But for development in Rwanda, one of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and 8 years later, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? I presume you are referring to those groups that exist-- FDLR. --in your neighbor. Yes. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the U.S. Right, right, right. We are working with President Kabila on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the Congo. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of the State Department and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. Because we do not want to be dragged again-- Back into the-no, no question. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. And I am really looking forward to going. President Kagame has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. To be able to come from where you were to where you are today is pretty remarkable. I think I said Rwanda is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech today, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of Rwanda to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up AFRICOM for development but not for war-- Africa for development but not for war. Q. War, war fighting, and then the AGOA, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary African, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And one way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the African culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? Is delicate issue. Well, thank you. First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an American child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of Americans and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of American commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, years ago, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ENTITY, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at Christmas, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in Laura's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an American family decided to spend money on a Christmas gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from America. There are thousands of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of America. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in Ghana that runs into one of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by U.S. dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to the United States, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; America did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on U.S. subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the Doha round-by the most effective place-first of all, AGOA has helped address that to a certain extent. One way it has-because it is opened up markets. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the United States farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In order to deal with this issue, however, there has to be full reciprocity by developing-large developing and developed nations. In other words, the United States farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful Doha round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in Ghana. Patience. Patience, where were you educated? I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in Nigeria. Oh, really? Interesting. Yes. Well, sir-- Are you living-- I am living in Liberia right now. Are you? Good. How is it going? Good. Is the capital, like, improving-- Well, we are sort of, like, accelerating-- This is off the record, right? --road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? Maybe I ought to come every other month. Okay. Is there noticeable construction now-- Yes. --besides my trip? Yes. Yes. From 2003 to date, there has been an increase in road construction. We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Are people feeling safer? Yes. People are feeling safer. Those on the ground are feeling safer. Particularly in the city? But, like, for Liberians here in America-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. Thank you. Security Situation in Africa And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the U.N. mission down there. But right now the U.N. mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing AFRICOM in Liberia, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into Liberia, which is what mostly Liberia needs right now. First of all, AFRICOM is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how AFRICOM will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a State Department component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how AFRICOM should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider Liberia. Liberia is a friend. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider Liberia, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of AFRICOM is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, U.S. command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than Central Command, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong State Department component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. About Kenya, ENTITY, there is been a month-and-a-half now of continuous ethnic violence. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? Yes. I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think the United States ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help Kofi Annan convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in Rwanda, I am going to ask Condi to go over to Kenya and sit down with the leaders in Kenya to see if we cannot help Kofi advance the-Kofi Annan advance the way forward. One of the U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in Somalia and, again, worsening relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like Al Qaida can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been Al Qaida- some Al Qaida operating out of Somalia, and therefore, when you know some Al Qaida have been in and out of Somalia and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. And we are. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of Ethiopia and Eritrea's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to Condi about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that the State Department and our Embassies are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the U.S., which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the U.S. We actually happen to have a base there as well, in Djibouti. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 452, "text": "Mr. ENTITY, your Secretary of State talked yesterday of hard choices to be made on both sides. What are the main difficulties facing you and President Gorbachev as you sit down at the table next week at the summit? Well, of course, there is a cloud of tension because of the Baltic States. I determined long ago that it was important that this summit meeting go forward and be successful, and yet I would be misleading you if I did not say that the inability to get dialog going there between the Lithuanians and the Soviets does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the United States. Secondly, I'd like to think we can move the conventional force talks further along than they are now. I think in START we are in reasonable shape, although it will not be ready for a treaty signing. On the chemical weapons side, I think there could well be good news for the free world and everybody in the world if they share my concern about reduction and eventual elimination of chemical weapons. The European questions are not solved by a long shot. How, for example, does post-German unification Europe look? Who will be calling the shots? What is the role for the United States in terms of stability? So, all of these questions will be on the table, and I look forward to a very frank and full discussion. One thing I have found is Mr. Gorbachev will lay it on the table, and I think I owe it to him to let him know how we in the alliance feel and how we in the United States feel on our bilateral. Mr. ENTITY taking those one at a time, Lithuania and the other Baltic States are struggling for the kind of freedom and independence that is right at the heart of the American ideal. Are you in any sense embarrassed that your pursuit of arms control success is in fact preventing you from saying what you would like to say about Lithuania? The I do not think it is preventing me, because what I say about Lithuania is, Lithuania is entitled to self-determination, to determine their own future. You see, our country has never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. But where it could be a problem is some say because we feel that way and we do passionately and because talks are not going forward between the Lithuanians and the Soviets, therefore you ought to not have this meeting or set this summit meeting back. I do not feel that way. But I do not think it diminishes my personal commitment to freedom and democracy because we talk with the Soviets. I would give you an example. We talked to the Soviets when Czechoslovakia was not free and Hungary was not free and Poland was not free. And so, we have a broad agenda there. And I'd like to feel that Mr. Gorbachev wants to go forward with what he says he is for, that is, eventual self-determination. But I do not feel a conflict there. But if Mr. Gorbachev continues to deny the Lithuanians and the other Baltic States self-determination, the right to go independent, will you not be forced to sacrifice the arms control treaty at some stage? The You know something, I have learned long ago not to answer questions quite that hypothetical, with respect, because we can conjure up a lot of scenarios, good and bad, and answer; but that I do not think is helpful on the eve of his visit here. But believe me, I will have an opportunity, as our Secretary of State did just within the last week, to reaffirm the United States commitment to freedom and to self-determination. You do not feel that you are sacrificing Lithuania on the order of arms control expediency? The I do not think so. And our agenda with the Soviet Union has far more to do with a lot of other subjects, too, than just arms control. But may I answer your question with a rhetorical question? When we talked to the Soviet Union when Czechoslovakia was what we call captive nation Hungary was and Poland was were we sacrificing their freedom in discussing arms control with the Soviet Union? Now, the world would clearly say of course you were not , as long as we adhere to our principle of self-determination and freedom. So, that is the way I'd respond to my critics. And you are saying that arms control is the most important thing on your agenda, and you will go for that come what may? No, I am not saying that is the most important. That is what you are saying or suggesting or asking me if I am saying. We have a lot of regional problems that we discuss with the Soviet Union. We have the whole question of post-German unification Europe that is very, very important to the people in the U.K. and France and other NATO countries. We have the questions of German participation in NATO a vital question. So, I am not trying to set out for you priorities. Do I think arms control is important? Yes. Are we working with diligence to try to have a good arms control agenda? Absolutely. But I cannot tell you that is the only thing that drives the meetings between me and Mr. Gorbachev. I want to talk to him frankly about things in Europe and in this hemisphere, and I do not want these two gigantic ships to pass in the night because of misunderstanding. Finally, Mr. ENTITY do you think that Mr. Gorbachev is going to survive, that he is going to be the person you will be negotiating with in a year's time, given the pressures that he has from the democrats and the radicals on one hand and from the military on the other? The I am inclined to think the answer to your question is yes, but it is not my role as President of the United States to try to sort out who should lead the Soviet Union. In Mr. Gorbachev I see a man who has presided over dramatic changes in Eastern Europe that benefit freedom and benefit mankind, if you will, and so I give him credit for that. I see somebody who is talking about perestroika and reform inside and openness, glasnost inside the Soviet Union, and I give credit for that. But Soviet leadership is up to the Soviet people. And I do not think one's foreign policy can be determined or be predicated on one person cannot be. But I think most Western leaders feel that in Mr. Gorbachev we have a man with whom we can talk frankly, with whom we agree on many principles; a man who has many problems, internal problems, facing him I am talking about predominately economic problems a man who has tried to work with us constructively on many fields. So, that is why we are going to approach this summit with great openness, and yet there are outside events and you mentioned Lithuania outside concerns that put a little bit of a tension on this meeting. But in terms of my sitting down, up at Camp David, and talking frankly with Mr. Gorbachev, he is the kind of person you can do that with. And I believe that that is useful to every country that the United States deal in this manner with Mr. Gorbachev. But that is not to say we have no problems. Mr. ENTITY thank you very much for talking to the audience.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmartynlewisbbc1britishtelevision", "title": "Interview With Martyn Lewis of BBC - 1, British Television", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-martyn-lewis-bbc-1-british-television", "publication_date": "24-05-1990", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 407, "text": "Can you tell us about the Somali pirate operation and what led the President to make those remarks to Leon Panetta last night? Well, it is true that the President, when he saw the Secretary of Defense, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was congratulating them on a successful mission because he had been informed at, I believe, 6:43 p.m. of the success of the mission to rescue the American hostage as well as the Danish hostage. What led to it was the President was apprised of the fact that Jessica Buchanan had been taken hostage back on, I believe it was October 25th -- he was apprised of it the next day, of the kidnapping, and was updated on it regularly. I think the Department of Defense has more details on this, but the decision to go ahead with this rescue mission was made because there was information concerning the deteriorating health of Ms. Buchanan, as well as a window of opportunity to try to execute this mission. The President made the decision about 9:00 p.m. on -- let me make sure I get this right -- 9:00 p.m. on Monday night -- that is right -- when his counterterrorism advisor, John Brennan, briefed the President in the residence at approximately 9:00 p.m. on Monday night. And the President authorized the operation to proceed. Throughout the day yesterday, the President received updates from Mr. Brennan and was told at 6:43 p.m. that Ms. Buchanan and Mr. Thisted were safe and in U.S. hands. ENTITY, did the President speak to the SEAL team or the SEAL team commander today expressing his -- I have no calls to report. He did call -- upon return from finishing the State of the Union address, he called Ms. Buchanan's father at 10:32 p.m. -- John Buchanan -- and informed him of the successful mission. Was there any concurrent Situation Room monitoring of this whole thing, like the situation that went on during the bin Laden operation? I would refer you to the Department of Defense for that kind of information. The mission was, as you would expect, monitored very closely throughout -- I mean, in the White House Situation Room -- I think I just said that John Brennan was briefing the President regularly in his offices in the White House. How does the President feel today about how the State of the Union went last night, the reaction to it? He feels very positive. He feels -- he felt good about the speech. He felt very satisfied with the way the speech came together and the message about laying out a Blueprint for an America Built to Last was both -- was well received both in the hall and outside, across the country. So he understands that while many millions of Americans watched the speech last night, that part of his responsibility as President to try to move this agenda forward is to get out and talk about it around the country, which is why he is embarked on this trip today. ENTITY, the President has been talking about we cannot wait, but yesterday he talked a lot about initiatives that would require congressional action, some of which have failed in the past -- oil subsidies -- cutting oil subsidies, fee on big banks, those sorts of things. What kind of expectation does he honestly have that these things will happen, or are they merely kind of leverage points in order to get other things from them? I will make two points, Jim -- I appreciate the question. As we have said all along, the President is using every tool in his toolbox to try to advance his economic and jobs agenda. That includes working with Congress on things that require legislative action, but it also includes doing everything he can through executive action. And that was reflected in the State of the Union address last night. That has always been the case, and again, it was reflected last night. He is not nave about the kind of resistance that he is faced from Republican members of Congress and the obstructionist approach that many Republicans have taken to what is by any clear-eyed definition a very common-sense, centrist agenda. But he is also optimistic that there will be opportunities this year to move important pieces of business through Congress, not because suddenly Republicans will relent out of charity or goodwill, but because they will be under pressure from their constituents to show that they are doing something constructive to grow the economy and create jobs. As I have said before, every single member of the House of Representatives who is not retiring is up for reelection this fall, not just the President. A third of the Senate is up for reelection. And each of those elected representatives will have to explain to his or her constituents what they did in this Congress that helped the United States of America, helped the economy, helped create jobs. And if the answer is, I just opposed everything that President Obama put forward because President Obama put it forward, even though a lot of his ideas reflected input from Republicans or had their genesis in bipartisan proposals of the past, I think that is a hard message to sell. So we are hopeful that on a broad array of issues, whether it is helping ensure that Americans -- that every American can refinance, every responsible homeowner can refinance his or her home mortgage loan, or extending the payroll tax cut, or taking the action that the President will talk about today to enhance American manufacturing, make changes that are deficit-neutral to enhance American manufacturing -- is it really the position -- would it be the position of any member of Congress that they are against building the American manufacturing sector in this country, increasing the number of jobs that are available to Americans from that sector of the economy? Again, I'd like to hear the argument for that one. On the Buffett Rule, how did the President ultimately settle on 30 percent? And what have you guys thought about to put in place to prevent it from hitting small businesses? Well, first of all, I am not going to give you a schedule of how broad individual tax reform would break down and what impact it would have on capital gains or dividends or -- the principle the President laid out would guide, he believes very strongly should guide, tax reform. The 30 percent makes a lot of sense and it is not surprising because Warren Buffett, on this issue, himself has made a lot of sense, and it was the figure I believe Mr. Buffett also put forward. Again, it is a principle, and there is a lot of data to back it up, that there are a lot of very fortunate Americans, millionaires and billionaires, who pay taxes at a substantially lower rate than many, many millions of Americans of more modest means. The President simply believes that as a matter of principle, that unfairness ought to be changed. And not because it is class warfare, but because we have important priorities that need to be addressed in this country -- our national security, our investments in education and infrastructure, our commitments to our seniors -- and we are in a situation where we have to be very mindful of our fiscal health. So those are choices that have to be made, because if you do not insist that the tax code be fairer, that everyone does their fair share, then somebody else has to get stuck with the bill: seniors, middle-class Americans, kids with disabilities. It is just -- it is a choice that -- or you just load up on the deficit and the debt. And the President is opposed to that. We have heard of a lot of tax plans lately that, among other things, would do the reverse of the Buffett Rule. They would lower taxes for millionaires and billionaires who are paying at a much lower rate than a lot of Americans with moderate incomes or eliminate them entirely. That is not the right approach. And in addition to doing that -- or as a result of doing that, they would further add to our deficit and debt. The President believes that is the wrong approach. ENTITY, he had a fairly pointed tone against the lack of bipartisanship in Washington yesterday. Are we going to see that tone continue in these next five stops? Well, I will let you be the judge of that as we move through these three days. The President feels very strongly that outside of the Beltway, the nation is not nearly as divided as it is in Washington, and that the partisanship for partisanship's sake is excessive and frustrating for most Americans. They just want to see Washington work on the problems that they face every day. So I think, broadly speaking, the tone that the President adopted last night will be reflected going forward, but it was also a very positive and optimistic tone. He is -- he rejects the idea that there are challenges out there that we cannot solve. He rejects the idea that America is somehow in decline. In fact, he feels just the opposite. And the remarkable progress that has been made in the last couple of years since the worst recession since the Great Depression only reinforces his opinion that we are going to emerge stronger and better and with an economy that is built to last, as opposed to one that is built on ephemeral bubbles like the housing bubble or the Internet bubble or the financial sector bubble. The President had some stern words for China last night on its trade practices. Are we going to hear more of that on this trip as he visits factories? Well, again, today he is focusing on what I described before about his -- the manufacturing pillar. Now, there is an element here to that that has to do with enforcement on trade, as he talked about last night. When the President discussed this during his Asia trip, that everybody has got to play by the same set of rules, and that is important because he knows that when American manufacturers are put on a level playing field, they are the best there are, and they can compete. So obviously that is an important part of his agenda. But I do not want to quantify how much that will be a focal point in today's events, for example, but it is an important aspect of what he discussed last night. How would that proposal on education work, ENTITY, where the President said that schools -- colleges or universities that raise tuition would see a decrease in federal funding? And does that need legislative approval? The President will be discussing that specific proposal on Friday at Ann Arbor, so I am going to let him give you more details. But the general principle is that if universities and colleges are not doing a good job of keeping costs down, or costs keep going up, then their support from the federal government will go down. He believes that is very important because American -- higher education cannot become an unaffordable luxury for regular Americans because if it does, the impact on our long-term economic prospects will be very negative. So he is committed to making sure that higher education -- quality higher education remains accessible to Americans of all economic backgrounds. But where would the teeth be? I mean, how would you enact -- I would let -- I would ask you to wait for the President to provide more details, and we will provide more details on Friday. Today's focus is manufacturing. Will he specify the manufacturing rate that he wants to see? Yes, he will specify -- he will give specifics today, and we will provide you more details today about actions that Congress could take right away in a deficit-neutral way to enhance American manufacturing. Did he talk to you about seeing Gabby Giffords on the floor yesterday? He just said it was wonderful to see her -- briefly when we were on the plane earlier talking about it. And you could tell I thought, personally, when you watched it. But that is all he said -- it was wonderful to see her. ENTITY, back to the 30 percent tax rate. Does the White House believe that Mitt Romney's recently disclosed taxes and the effective rate of 14-15 percent that he pays provides a foundation for making the argument? The President's approach on this issue long predates recent developments in the other party's primary campaign. As you know, he is been talking about the Buffett Rule for a number of months now. And the President's ideas are not focused on any individual. They are focused on a general principle that millionaires and billionaires, folks who have had the good fortune of succeeding, thanks to all that this country has to offer, need to do their fair share; that they should not be paying taxes at a lower rate because of loopholes or irregularities in the tax system than average Americans. But as you know events propel ideas, so is this an event that propels your idea? Well, again, the idea well predates the event that you are describing, and again, it is not targeted towards an individual. If this is a purely sort of campaign question about the President versus a potential Republican nominee, I'd refer you to Chicago. Everybody good? Good. Anything else? How are you doing? I am great. I am a little tired, but pretty pumped up. It was a great night last night, for a variety of reasons, the speech and the mission.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressgagglepresssecretaryjaycarney7", "title": "Barack Obama Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-gaggle-press-secretary-jay-carney-7", "publication_date": "25-01-2012", "crawling_date": "03-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 54, "text": "Thank you, ENTITY. And I do not have to tell you how much we all appreciate this possibility of your time. As you probably know, the Hungarian people are looking forward with great anticipation and, I have to tell you, with great expectations to this first visit of an acting American President. And being a sentimental nation, as we are, I would like to lead up with the first question. I was wondering, as most Hungarians are, what ideas come to your mind when you think of our nation, our country, which actually never played a significant role in American policy? Does your visit signify a change in American policy toward Hungary? Well, it does signify a change in the sense that it is important that an American President salute the Hungarian people and salute the changes that are taking place in Hungary. It is not an American President's role to say to those in another country, you have to have your system this way, matching our system, or else we cannot do business with you. That is not my role. I have respect for, and enough experience to have respect for, the internal affairs of another country. But as we see the movement towards more openness, if you will, and towards participation by the people more in the political process, and by the movement towards an economic system that we think eventually will benefit the people of Hungary, we should salute that change. So, it is historic in the sense of an affection level for the people of Hungary to those that focus on it being here. Nobody's ever challenged that recognition that Hungary went through times where officially we had great differences. But then as things move forward in terms of reform and change and openness, we salute that. I have a combination of things in my mind as we move into this visit, just as I did when I was Vice President, but the evolution since then is even more marked. And I am looking forward to meeting those of the new leadership that I do not know -- three out of the four that I do not know. Mr. Grosz , I met, of course, as you know, when he was here. And I noticed the passing of Mr. Kadar . Well, there were mixed feelings about Mr. Kadar in the Hungarian-American community in this country. But as you look at the whole record, one points out the area where we had differences; but then one points also, in his death, with respect to the changes that he was able to implement. And we might get all kinds of argument in our political right or our political left about Mr. Kadar, but I look at him as a man who served his country. There was a time when we were frustrated and at odds back in the midfifties, as we all know. There is no point hiding that. But in death, give the man the credit for the things that he did accomplish. And he was most hospitable to me and able to discuss frankly the changes that were going there. And so, I would hope to conduct myself as President not to exacerbate differences but to look to the future and where we can work in more openness together. ENTITY, President Gorbachev had a very similar statement yesterday by saying that the Soviet Union is ready to accept the political system, whatever the Hungarian and the Polish people want. So, my question is that the United States would support with the same enthusiasm a new Hungarian government next year after free election if this government will be a leftist Communist-Socialist coalition, let us say? I have respect for the internal affairs of a country. We are not about to try to dictate how a demonstrably free election should come out. That is a matter for the people of Hungary. And I will, as President of the United States, deal with whoever is freely and openly elected and, in the process, welcome the fact that there will be evolution of the election process and party process, whatever happens. But it would be inappropriate for the President of the United States to try to fine-tune for the people of Hungary how they ought to eat -- how the cow ought to eat the cabbage, as we say in the United States. That is up to your people, and we will deal with whoever is elected. Now, I also think that you have to recognize that as the economic system evolves towards more openness and more privatization, for example, that makes it much easier for the United States to be a full partner in economic development and economic reform. ENTITY, the differentiation policy of the United States is basically -- it was basically a strategy of fighting communism in that part of the world. Now a new type of government is being formed in Hungary and also in Poland. My question is whether -- is there a possibility to develop this policy of differentiation into a policy of support and contribution to East European democracies? Yes, and I think you have already seen that. And as I say, I salute Hungary for being in the forefront of the change that resulted in our stated policy of differentiation. So, I would say that the changes in Poland in an economic sense are coming, but they are coming after what Hungary has done. There are other countries in Eastern Europe who have not begun to reflect the kind of change that we see in Hungary in the forefront, and with Poland coming along very strong now. And what I would like to do is keep our standards, the way we keep our principles in shape -- say this is what we aspire to for peoples all over the world in terms of freedom and democracy and these things, but then draw a fine line on -- here is the internal affair of Hungary now; here is the internal affair of Poland. Respect it; but still encourage the kinds of economic formulation that will result in our ability to help more. But I'd say the answer to your question is a simple yes. We will move forward with countries that can do what Hungary has done and is trying to do. Incidentally -- I do not think I am betraying a confidence -- I had a very interesting phone call last night from Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who has just been in Hungary. And I must say, he was very complimentary of the leaders with whom he met. And he was encouraging me, as the President of the United States, to go with an entirely open mind. And then he said: If you conclude as I have that there is an enormous opportunity for more closeness between Hungary and the West, or countries like Australia and the United States, let us all pitch in together and do what we can to help. I think it would be a tribute to the people in Hungary and the government officials that he came away with such a very positive view of what he had seen and what his conversations led to. It was unsolicited. He just called me and said: You are going to Hungary. I want you to know how strongly I feel about it. And, of course, you know how I feel about Bob Hawke, because he was here and I had a chance to say it publicly. ENTITY, 2 months ago in Brussels, you made sweeping proposals to release conventional arms. How does Eastern Europe and Hungary fit into your security assessment, and how does it fit into the Soviet-American relationship? Well, I think what we proposed at NATO -- total solidarity agreeing to the U.S. initiative that quickly became the NATO proposal. I think with that on the table, it should be very reassuring to the people of Hungary. And it is a proposal that has received a reasonable comment from Mr. Gorbachev. It is a proposal that offers great hope for reducing tensions in Europe, and in both East and West. And it is a proposal that I look forward to discussing with the leaders in Hungary because I will convince them, I think, that it is in the interest of all countries, West and East, to see us promptly -- and I use that word very carefully -- but promptly, with these reductions in all these categoric conventional arms. They are the most expensive. They are destabilizing if you have lack of parity there. And I am very excited about the challenge that lies ahead. And the challenge is to meet these timetables and to move these troops out. And some of it is U.S. troops coming home; and some of it is Soviet troops going out. Because I think if you have a balance between Soviet and U.S., the two largest powers, that reduces tension more than if it is just a reduction of Eastern forces or Western forces. So, it is an exciting proposal, and very candidly, I am pleased the way the Soviets have received it, although they obviously have not endorsed it the way we put it on the table. ENTITY, a question that intrigues most Hungarians -- and Poles, for that matter, too: It seems, so far, the expectations and the need for short- and long-term Western financial economic aid might exceed by far the amount that the West is willing, or can do at the moment. I was wondering, are there merely economic restraints on your side, or also political considerations? There are no political constraints today that I can see. There is none that I cannot handle as President of the United States with the Congress. And I say that with great confidence; and I do not say that about many subjects because Congress, as you know, can be very recalcitrant -- but the only constraints are economic. And, yes, we are burdened with our own economic problems here that I am not going to ask the Hungarian people to be sympathetic to because we are a very wealthy country. But I am going to be sure that your leaders know that there are certain confines within which I have to operate, but they are not political as it relates to Congress. I think support for what is happening in Hungary is strong in the United States Congress. And that the borders -- what is happening when the tearing down of the barriers on the borders has gotten wide acclaim in this country -- I mean, strong support. The trying on the part of Hungary to move towards more of a market-oriented economy -- that has been receiving, and will continue to receive, strong support. The fact that Hungary is moving in its own way with political reform is getting strong support. So, I do not think there is any problem in terms of support from the Congress, as it relates to Hungary politically. Now, people want to see performance. Those that are in charge of the purse strings on Capitol Hill want to be sure that the economic performance matches our expectations if we are going to give money or other countries are going to give money. But I do not think Poland is looking for a handout. They are looking for a hand up, and I wish that I was going to be in a freefall in terms of the funds that we could bring to bear on the problem. We are not . But we will try to have some ideas and some funds that can be helpful in some way to Hungary. ENTITY, but there is one particular problem with Congress. Countries are put in different baskets, and Hungary is still in the basket of no-market economics -- countries with no-market economies, countries with nondemocratic system, and so on. And Hungary is approaching now a status when these labels are somewhat different now. And can you foresee a time when a Warsaw Pact country can be called as a free, democratic system with a free-market economy? Well, I can certainly foresee such a time with great hope in my heart, and we are seeing dynamic change taking place today. We keep talking about Hungary and Poland, but they are the most visible example of this, Hungary having been in the forefront of the economic change, before Poland. But I can foresee that day, and I can foresee a rapid recognition of this change by the Congress, who has, as you say, with the support of administrations, placed these differentiating barriers on the various countries. But we have our principles, and I do not think they are very much different than what the man on the street aspires to in Hungary. And I will be holding high our principles and saying, look, to the degree change can accommodate privatization or more market for us or more openness towards the West, then we can do more. And I think I have to do that. I do not want to go there and look like -- that there are no differences at all. But I am an optimist about the developments in Eastern Europe -- and with the Soviet Union, I might add. I am an optimist, and I will do my best as President of the United States to help facilitate change. I want to see perestroika succeed in the Soviet Union. We are not dragging our feet on it. I will use this occasion with you leading journalists to make the point: I want to see it succeed. And I am not going to Hungary to try to complicate life for Mr. Gorbachev. And nor do I suspect when he goes to Paris that he is there simply to complicate life for the United States. He is not, and I know that. So, I will be there talking, however, about what we believe in. We are the United States, and I am the President of the United States, and I feel strongly on certain things that relate to the rights of the people to be heard and all of that. They do not want me to come there with some subdued message. I am going there with a strong message. At least twice in its modern history, the Hungary people turned for help to the people of the United States -- at least twice. It was in 1848 and in 1956, and frankly saying, the American reaction was disappointing in those cases. My -- maybe a little apathetic -- question is -- -- No, no. -- -- does this great country feel any kind of responsibility for the future of East Europe and for the future of Hungary? I cannot say responsibility for -- I have got to be careful on translation. No, I do not feel a responsibility for it, but I do feel a great empathy for the change and an affection for the heartbeat of the Hungarian people. You mentioned 1956, and I know exactly what you are talking about, and I am old enough to remember. A lot of our kids do not remember this -- people standing up for their freedoms and all. On the other hand, I think a country like the United States ought not to overpromise, ought not to overexhort for others to be like us, and thus cause problems to be worse for the people. And I do not know what was expected in 1956 by the man on the street, but if the expectation was military confrontation with the Soviet Union, that expectation was, regrettably, too high. And yet we can identify with the kids that were at the barricades. We can identify with the aspiration for more freedom or more voice in their system; so can the people in the Soviet Union. Look at the changes that are taking place. So, my goal is not to go back and relive those times in the past but to salute the change in the present and then look into the future. And that is how I feel about it. They asked me a question in the interview with the Polish journalists about young people who aspire to come to this country. And, look, we want people to aspire to come to the United States. I want the Statue of Liberty to stand for something all over the world. So it was the Statue of Liberty that momentarily held her arm up there in Tiananmen Square. But I also would say to the kids in Eastern Europe: Look, you are living in an exciting time. You are living in a time of dynamic change. And you love your country. And you are Hungarian, or you are Polish. And, yes, our doors are going to be open, and God forbid the day that they slam closed. But you have got an exciting future now, you 21-year-old guy at some university there in Hungary, and be part of the change, be part of what is happening in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union. And I say that hopefully, without looking like the welcome mat will be pulled back, because it will not be. But if I were a kid, 21 now and were living in Hungary, I'd say, God, this is exciting. I can be a part of all this. I might even get to be President. May I have a last one? Yes. ENTITY, after your Budapest visit, you will stop in Paris with the seven nations to discuss how to help the Polish and Hungarian economy. Would you give us an idea what you expect and how the West together help these two nations? Well, I feel funny talking about it before I have met with them because the leaders of the G - 7 are all very conscious of their own responsibilities and for their own economies and for working together -- for a decision coming out of the G - 7 to be a joint decision. So, I do not want to get out in front of the others. But I would say this: that how the West can interact with Hungary or with Poland will be a star item on our agenda. And it is not something that the U.S. is forcing on to the agenda, as strong as I feel about it. It is something that we touched on at the last NATO meeting, actually, and that subsequently other leaders have indicated to us that they want to continue to discuss. So, it will be treated there. I cannot tell you what I think will happen. A lot of the discussion will revolve around the multilateral support, I am sure, through multilateral agencies. And again, we come up against two thoughts. One is, what kinds of reforms are necessary for us to give all-out support from these multilateral institutions? And then the other one is: How much money is available; what are the funds? ENTITY, by thanking you, let me ask a very last question. You got it. Like Sarah McClendon. But you do not shout and wave your arms around. You said the cold war began in Eastern Europe; it will end there. What can we do for the Americans and your new junior partner, Hungary, to have the cold war really end in Eastern Europe? Continue the kinds of changes and openness that is taking place. When Bob Hawke told me he met with opposition leaders and they were fully engaged with the Government in terms of discussion about the freedom of the election process to come -- all of that is strong; all of that is good. We have got a two-party system -- sometimes it seems like a twenty-party system, all the factions in the Republican Party, all in the Democratic. We are not going to say to you the only way you can have good relations with the United States is to have a two-party system and call one of them Republicans and another Democrats. I would not inflict that on anybody. But I do think that, as the dynamics of the political change takes place, why, this plays right into the enthusiastic, welcoming hands of the United States, of our Congress, and of our administration. So, my thing is: Keep it going. Keep it going, and it does not have to be to the detriment of anybody else. It is just what is best for the people in Hungary; what is the best for that surge of freedom and independence that Hungarians feel and have always felt. I mean, how do they participate the most and fulfill their dreams? I cannot wait to get there.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithhungarianjournalists", "title": "George Bush Interview With Hungarian Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-hungarian-journalists", "publication_date": "06-07-1989", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 477, "text": "thank you very much for supporting our channel and our initiative. We will make sure on our channel, your policy, the point of view of your administration, will always be presented clearly and in fair context. However, we will make sure-we want to be a model for the free press, the American tradition- other point of views, relevant ones, will always be there, even if they are critical of you. Well, I understand that. I hope so. First of all, I appreciate your willingness to allow the people in the Middle East to hear my views. My views are one that speaks to freedom. I believe the Almighty God's gift to every person in the world is freedom, and I work for free societies because I believe in people. I want people to know that I respect religion. I am a religious man, myself. I respect the religion of other people as well. I believe we pray to the same Almighty God. I want people to know that I believe in peace. I want there to be peace. I also want people to know that it is very important for us to work together to fight terror, to fight those who would be willing to kill innocent lives in order to foster their own personal agendas. I appreciate that. I also do not mind people expressing opinions other than mine. I expect that to happen. It happens here in America, and I expect it to happen around the world. You may be the only world leader today, and maybe the first American President, to pay a lot of attention to freedom and democracy in the Middle East. Why is that? Are you so committed to that? I am very committed to freedom and democracy in the Middle East. I believe people can self-govern around the world. Now, there are some, admittedly, say, Well, they cannot have freedom and democracy in the Middle East. But I think that point of view is condescending. I think it diminishes the hopes and aspirations of the citizenry of the Middle East. I absolutely believe in freedom and peace, and I look forward to working with governments to achieve freedom and peace. Now, I recognize not every government is going to fashion a free society in the vision of America. I do not expect that, but I do expect every government to uphold the aspirations of the average citizens in a free society. You mentioned in the State of the Union Address that you would be doubling the budget for the National Endowment of Democracy towards the Middle East. What is your vision? How are you trying to accomplish that? Well, I think we need to work with governments and institutions and NGOs to encourage the institutions of a free society. See, one of the interesting things in the Oval Office-I love to bring people into the Oval Office, right around the corner from here, and say, This is where I office, but I want you to know the office is always bigger than the person. In other words, free societies are societies where people come and go, but the institutions that protect the rights of people never leave. And that is what the institute is going to be working on, free press, just like we just talked about, free elections, free society. You said you would be working with governments in the Middle East. Sure. And you know the type of governments that now exist in the Middle East, and for how long the U.S. has been accused of playing ball with governments that people hate. When you say you want this strategy, forward strategy of freedom, are you saying you are going to be abandoning the monarchies and, you know, those guys? No, of course not. I know them well. First of all, many of the countries in the Middle East are modernizing. And that is what I look for. I fully understand it takes time for free societies, truly free societies to evolve. I do not expect instant success. After all, in my own country it took a while for our current system to evolve. Take Saudi Arabia, for example. First of all, I respect Crown Prince Abdullah and like Crown Prince Abdullah. He is a man of great faith and great integrity who gave a speech the other day about the need to modernize and to reform Saudi society. I take him for his word. To me that was a positive development. King Abdullah of Jordan, the King of Morocco, I mean, there is a series of places-Qatar, Oman-I mean, places that are developing-Bahrain-they are all developing the habits of free societies. They evolve differently. But nevertheless, progress is being made. And for that, I am very grateful. When you sit down with the leaders of the countries you just mentioned, ENTITY, do you get a sense of the urgency, when we talk about the issues of reform and democracy, from them? Well, I get a sense of two things from them. One, I do believe they understand the need to reform. But I also know they agree that we need to continue to work together to fight terror. And that is vital, because it is hard for a free society to develop with terrorists killing innocent people. For example, I have a vision in the Middle East for there to be a Palestinian state. I am the first ENTITY to have ever articulated a Palestinian state. I believe there needs to be a Palestinian state, and I am not going to change my opinion. On the other hand, I know how hard it is to achieve a Palestinian state so long as there is groups of terrorists willing to murder in order to prevent that from happening. And so I hear two things. I hear, one, the need to reform, to include more people in the process which is taking place, but also the clear understanding from leaders that we must continue to work together to fight off the terrorists. And I say this with conviction. There is a-the murderous ambitions of a few are trying to derail the hopes of many. And my Government wants to work with governments to prevent that from happening. Has the roadmap failed? Do we need a new approach to revive the peace talks and work towards your vision? No, not at all, no. The roadmap is in place. What has failed is the-some parties are not advancing on the roadmap. They are stuck. And I stood up with Mr. Abu Mazen, at that time the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, with Prime Minister Sharon, in Aqaba, Jordan-and King Abdullah, of course, our host-and we linked arms and said, Let us move forward on the roadmap to peace. There needs to be a commitment to fight terror. There needs to be a commitment to put the institutions of a free society in place. There needs to be a commitment on the Israelis to worry about the plight of the average Palestinian citizen-to encourage a society to evolve that is commercially viable and free. There needs to be a commitment from the neighborhood to help fight off the flow of funds to fund the terrorist groups, that would stop. And we were making progress. We really were, and then he got shoved aside. And so the roadmap is still intact. The vision for where we need to go is intact. What we need right now are parties who are willing to take a risk for peace and to lead. And I look forward to working with any such party. Why then are some people in the U.S. or some of your friends and allies in the Middle East say that you are not personally doing enough? How would you respond to that? Well, I would remind them of the pictures of Aqaba, Jordan. I mean, it is -it is a rare occurrence when ENTITY stands up with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and says, We are linked together to move toward peace. The problem was, was that somebody undermined that peace process by making it very difficult for Prime Minister Abu Mazen to work to achieve his vision. And that somebody was Chairman Arafat. I am sorry that happened. On the other hand, I still believe that a Palestinian state is essential for the aspirations of the Palestinian people. And I fully understand there needs to be a firm commitment to fight off terror in order for that to happen. On the issue of Iraq, how do you see the transition of sovereignty to the Iraqis? Moving. I mean, if you really take a step back, we are here in February of 2004, and the Iraqi people were not really liberated until April of 2003. We have not been there a year. And yet, there is tremendous progress being made. The first thing I pay attention to-there are voices speaking out about how to achieve democracy. Had those voices spoken out last year or the year before or the year before, they probably would not be a voice anymore, given the fact that Saddam Hussein was willing to torture and kill dissidents. And today, a free society is emerging. And it may look bumpy at times, but democracy sometimes looks bumpy. I mean, here in our own country I am sure people take a step back and say, What is happening in the election process? I mean, it looks like there are some sharp elbows. But I am encouraged by what is taking place in Iraq. I appreciate so very much the fact that the Shi'as speak out for freedom. I appreciate the fact that the Sunnis are questioning whether or not they have a role in the future of their country. I appreciate the fact that the Kurds are active. I appreciate the fact that all three parties are trying to work for a common law that guarantees the religious rights of others, the minority rights of people in a free society. So I think it is very positive. We look forward to working with the United Nations to help the process along, to add some international legitimacy to what the Iraqis think is necessary to move the process toward a new constitution and elections of people. From the outside, it looked like the Grand Ayatollah in Iraq, he is a religious man, he is calling for immediate elections, and we are kind of hesitant to do it right now. What is your reaction to that? Well, that is very interesting. No, I understanding completely. First of all, I admire the fact that he is confident enough in democracy to call for elections. I mean, after all, America believes in elections. I think the only hesitancy from the experts is whether or not the process is ready to absorb direct elections. And we want to work with Mr. Sistani, the Ayatollah. He is a wise man. He is a distinguished gentleman who cares deeply about the Iraqi people. And I am confident we can work toward a solution that is in Iraq's interest and, at the same time, addresses his deep desire to have the people of Iraq participate in the process. I think the fact that he is willing to be involved is a very positive development. It shows people care about the future of Iraq. We just must all work together to come up with an Iraqi solution as to how best to get a constitution written and then direct elections. The first step, of course, is a general law and then a temporary assembly of some kind to help-so we can hand over sovereignty. And then the process moves forward. If we can move towards Syria. Sure. You had a couple of phone calls with the Syrian President after September 11, and things looked, you know, that ENTITY of Syria was going in the right direction, according to your administration. And then things went sour. What happened? Well, first of all, I think we made some legitimate requests. I said, Look, Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. They headquartered in your country. You need to shut down those headquarters. You need to prevent terrorist activities from being planned and/or orders being-emanating out of Syria. Secondly, you have got to work on the border to make sure that the border between Iraq and Syria is not porous, but, in fact, you are able to stop the flow of people and contraband and information back and forth. We do not want terrorists coming in from Syria into Iraq to kill innocent Iraqis and/or American troops. And it is very important for us to keep sending that message to him. That is why I appreciate doing this interview. The message still stands. And we would hope there would be a strong cooperation on these very reasonable points. The Syrian President sent a couple of signals recently expressing his willingness to resume peace talks with Israel. Would you be willing-how do you assess this-- It is very interesting. First of all, I am interested in peace. And the fact that a party is willing to talk about peace is, I think, a positive signal. I look forward to understanding fully what that means. As you know, there was-some progress had been made prior to my arrival as President on Syrian-Israeli peace talks. And we have just got to understand the intent, the sincerity, and the desire of both parties involved-that would be Syria and Israel. Libya. Yes. Although some people, maybe in Washington, and you may consider what happened with Libya as a success for diplomacy, but it did not sit well with the Libyans. It looks like it contradicts this forward strategy of freedom. How do you mean it did not sit well with them? It sat well with Colonel Qadhafi because he made the decision. But in terms of democracy, I mean, you know, Qadhafi is a dictator-- Oh, whether or not democracy then follows-I see. Well, we hope it does, of course, and we look forward to working with him. But first things first. We had no relationship with Libya, and now the relationship can improve because he has made a very wise decision to disclose programs and dismantle those programs. To me, it is a signal that Colonel Qadhafi is interested in a peaceful-is interested in peace and a resumption of relations with a country like the United States, and that will begin to change the relationship. Right now we want to make sure that we all fulfill our obligations. And a key obligation is for the United States and Great Britain and the IAEA to work with the Libyans to fully disclose and dismantle, in a transparent way, weapons programs. Would it be safe to say that the United States would not fully normalize with Libya unless the human rights record of the Libyan Government were to improve-- Well, obviously, there is a lot of conditionality in any relationship. We do want to improve relationships with Libya, but the first thing-the first step, of course, is for the Colonel to fulfill his commitment to the entire world, and that is to disclose and dismantle. And then the relationship will evolve. On the issue of weapons of mass destruction-Iran. Yes. Libya is a case where diplomacy worked. Iraq is a place where-- Diplomacy did not work. --did not work. Well, it did not work. It was tried for 12 years, and it did not work. And the world continually said, Disarm, and he did not do it. And finally, I went to the United Nations and said to the United Nations, For your sake and for our sake-you, the United Nations' sake-for our sake, America, and for the world's sake, let us enforce these resolutions. So we have got the Libyan model, and we have got the Iraqi model. Yes. Which one would fit Iran today? All models must start with a strong effort by the world community to convince people to abandon-in this case, abandon programs, nuclear weapons programs. And we certainly hope the Iranian situation can be resolved diplomatically. I appreciate very much the fact that members of the European Community have spoken with one voice about the need for Iran * to fully disclose and disarm its weapons programs, and IAEA is very much involved. So, in other words, we are now early in the stage, obviously, and it is a stage where I am hopeful that diplomacy will work. You mentioned the international community. Are you satisfied with the way the international community is reacting towards the rebuilding of Iraq? Yes, I really am. I mean, gosh, there is a lot of countries that are very much involved in Iraq. The other night in the State of the Union, I began to read off the list. And the longer the list got, the more the American people begin to realize this is a truly internationalized effort. And people are contributing money. I mean, I was talking about forces on the ground, and the level of contributions are very generous-starting with the United States, I might add. And I am most proud of the Congress for being willing to help rebuild Iraq, because they understand, like I understand, that a free Iraq is going to be an agent of change in a positive way in the Middle East. Again, I want to go back to where we began. See, if you did not believe certain countries in the Middle East could be free, then you would not be worried about rebuilding of a country. But I believe they can be free, and I know free societies are peaceful societies. And I believe in the Iraqi people of all walks of life, and I believe that they are going to show the world what is possible. After all, the Iraqi people have such a- Iraqi history is so rich. The culture of Iraq is fantastic. And it is -I have visions of a university system that really leads the Middle East in education and on the forefront of science and engineering, because I know the Iraqi Americans who are here, very bright, capable, honorable people who have come to our country, realized the benefits of freedom, taken advantage of some fantastic opportunities, and made great citizens. Well, the same thing is going to happen in Iraq. And that will cause others to say, Well, gosh, if it is happening in Iraq, let us follow that model of a free society. And the American Congress understands that. I understand that. And a lot of people around the world understand it. And I am grateful for the contributions that people are willing to make for the reconstruction of Iraq. Are you concerned that Iraq's neighbors may work to undermine the democracy because it does not suit the region? Well, it is an interesting question. I certainly hope not. But if-look, one of the neighbors to Iraq is Turkey. And they withstood any pressure, if there was any pressure, to undermine the development of a free and secular society. They still maintain its respect for Islam. Pakistan is another country which is evolving, showing what is possible in terms of a free society and an active Parliament and, at the same time, honoring Islam. No, I think a truly free society will resist foreign efforts to undermine the development of that society. ENTITY, this is an election year for you. Yes. If, hypothetically, people in the Middle East could vote, would the next 4 years be-if you were to be elected- would be good for them? Oh, absolutely. Why would they vote for you? Absolutely. Well, they'd vote for me because I am strong on the war on terror, for starters. I refuse to relent to terrorist groups. There is no negotiation with these people. These are people that are willing to kill people who are devout, religious people, and not care about it. They kill innocent women and children and not care about it. More Muslims have died at the hands of killers than-I say more Muslims-a lot of Muslims have died-I do not know the exact count-at Istanbul. Look at these different places around the world where there is been tremendous death and destruction because killers kill. They would appreciate George W. in the future because I understand that freedom and prosperity go hand in hand. And a free society is more likely to be a prosperous society where people can realize their hopes and aspirations. Listen, I am a dad. I love my girls more than anything in life, our daughters. I know that other dads feel the same way about their children, and all they want is for their children to have a chance to succeed, to grow up in a peaceful society, to be well-educated, and to realize their God-given potential. I share that dream. I think the people of the Middle East will see that the Bush administration is unrelenting when it comes to dealing with the few who want to hurt the many but, at the same time, believes in the people of the Middle East, believes in their hopes and aspirations. Thank you very much, ENTITY.

{"id": 448, "text": "ENTITY, welcome to the program, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. Of course, we want to talk about the negotiations over the debt and the debt ceiling on Wednesday. You said that you like the compromise offered by the so-called Gang of Six, that bipartisan group of three Republican and three Democratic senators. What is in this plan that is been missing from earlier efforts, that makes it appealing to you? Well actually, it is not so much that it is hugely different from some of the previous frameworks that were, for example, put out by my fiscal commission or that I talked about several months ago. What was different was that you had Republican senators acknowledging that revenues need to be part of a balanced package. And you had Democratic senators acknowledge that we are going to have to make some difficult spending cuts in order to achieve the kinds of debt and deficit reduction that are important to the economy. So what I have said consistently, and what I think this bipartisan group of senators confirmed and frankly, what everybody who has looked at this who is outside the political process has acknowledged - is, is that in order for us to solve the debt and deficit problems, we have got to cut spending that we do not need; we have to eliminate programs that may not be working; we have got to make some tough decisions around things like defense spending as well as domestic spending. But we are also going to have to have more revenues, and we can do that in a way that is not hurting the economy; in fact, that could potentially help the economy by closing up some loopholes that distort the economy. So my hope is, is that with that acknowledgement that we need a balanced approach, that Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are going to be willing to engage in the kind of compromise that can resolve this problem. What do you think the hold-up has been so far? Do you think that people - there are people who really do not believe the consequences will really be as dire as many people say they will be if the debt ceiling is not raised? Do you think it is the case that some people will not support a compromise just because you do? What - what do you think the hold up's been? Well, probably a little bit of all of the above. You have got some members of the Republican Party who've been downplaying the consequences of default. The irony is, you know, Ronald Reagan, I think, when he was president, repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way. I think that there is some politics. And compromising with me, among some Republican leaders, is bad politics for them. I also think that in fairness that the decisions we have got to make right now are tough ones, and nobody likes them. I mean, it is always easier to give people more benefits and cut their taxes than it is to raise more revenue and reduce benefits. And so what we have got to do is to have an honest conversation with each other about each side taking on some of their sacred cows. And frankly, that is what the American people expect. I mean, what you have been seeing in recent polling is, the American people agree with the approach that I have talked about a balanced approach. Even the majority of Republicans agree that it should not just be spending cuts; that those, like myself, who've been incredibly blessed and can afford to pay a little more, or oil companies that are doing very well and do not need the tax breaks that are currently in the tax code, that we have got to make some sacrifices as well to solve the problem. Well, let us talk a little bit more about those sacrifices, though. We have talked a lot about taxes and raising taxes, and the argument around that. But let us talk about it the other way. Specifically this plan, this bipartisan plan would trim the amount that goes into entitlement programs. Now, you have been saying everybody's got to give something... Right. ...and you are willing to give up on some things that are important to other Democrats, to progressives. But what about what is your message to Democrats and perhaps I should say progressives who say that the most vulnerable people in this country have already suffered too much in recent years and gotten too little? Well, I think what is absolutely true is, is that core commitments that we make to the most vulnerable have to be maintained. And so a lot of the spending cuts that we are making should be around areas like defense spending, as opposed to food stamps. I do think that when it comes to entitlements, when we are talking about Social Security and Medicare, that those are not entitlement programs where people are not contributing; it would be that they are social insurance programs that people have been making contributions to, and they are the most important part of our social safety net so that when people retire, they can retire with dignity and respect. What is true is that given the rising number of seniors, and given the huge escalation in health-care costs, that if we do not structure those programs so that they are sustainable, then it is going to be hard for the next generation to enjoy those kinds same kinds of benefits. And so we are going to have to make some modest changes that retain the integrity of the program, but make sure that they are there for years to come. And that is not even just a deficit problem, that is a a step that even if we were all Democrats up here on Capitol Hill, we'd have to start making, to make sure that the integrity of those programs are preserved. Let us talk about the unemployed for a minute. Right. I think you probably know the numbers better than I do... Right. But just for those who do not , that there are 14 million Americans who do not have jobs right now. Perhaps the real number might be as high as 16 million, and the overall rate is 9.2 percent. Among Latinos, it is 11.6 percent; among African Americans, it is 16 16.2 percent, which is a very large number. You know, there is so much of the conversation in recent days has been around the debt, the $14 trillion debt. What do you say to people who might be listening to our conversation right now, who are unemployed, and who are saying: When will there be daily meetings about us? Well, first of all, in the White House there are daily meetings about the unemployed. The single most important thing we can do for the economy is putting people back to work. And by the way, if we put more people back to work, that in and of itself reduces the deficit because those folks are paying taxes and less in need of things like unemployment insurance and and that is part of the reason why the deficit exploded over the last decade. But also over the last two years, in particular, is because a lot of folks have been not getting raises, not seeing their wages increase. Or they have been losing their jobs, or they do not have health care and so they make more demands on government. So we have got to focus on jobs. Now, there are some things that we can do right now that would make a difference. Some of the tax breaks to small business, the payroll tax cut that put a thousand dollars into the pockets of the average family all those things are designed to boost the economy, allow businesses to hire back workers. I have talked about the need for infrastructure. We have got all sorts of work that needs to be done on roads and bridges and broadband lines and high-speed rail that could put folks who've been laid off from the housing industry and construction back to work right now in rebuilding America. We have got trade deals pending that could create tens of thousands of jobs here in the United States of America. So there are things that we can do right now. The argument that I have consistently made is that if we are able to do some serious work on debts and deficits, then it removes the focus solely on what we cannot do what government cannot do and we can get back to talking about what are some things that we can do, that can really make a difference. And you know, I do not think that it is contradictory to say that we want to get our fiscal house in order so that we can really make sure that we are doing everything we can on education, and doing everything we can on research and development, everything we can on promoting clean energy jobs, because as long as our fiscal house is not in order, then it is very hard to move forward on new initiatives that would make a big dent on the unemployment front. If you are just joining us, you are listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Our guest is ENTITY of the United States, ENTITY. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the 16.2 percent unemployment figure, which is it seems to set off a fairly intense debate, particularly among African- American intellectuals. The Princeton professor Cornell West, whom you know, who was a supporter of yours in the last election, recently called you forgive me a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs. And the question is, do you think you have any special responsibility to look out for the interest of African-Americans? I have a special responsibility to look out for the interests of every American. That is my job as president of the United States, and I wake up every morning trying to promote the kinds of policies that are going to make the biggest difference for the most number of people so that they can live out their American Dream. And you know, I think that everybody who is looked at what the economy has gone through over the last two years understands that we went through a once-in-a-generation crisis. It is painful for a lot of folks, and I completely understand that. But I do not think that there is a single step that we have taken that has not been designed to make sure that more people are out there working, that more people are out there getting the kinds of incomes that can support their families. And we are just going to keep on doing those things that we think are going to be best for all Americans. But you know, of course, many people said that Dr. West's remarks were over the top and out of bounds, but their criticism of his remarks were that number one, talking about race is just not productive and two, that those remarks enable people who are not according you and your presidency respect the respect that they feel is owed, in part, because of your race. And I wonder if you think that any of that is true. I think that when you are president of the United States, it comes with the territory that folks are going to criticize you. That is what I signed up for. OK. Well, speaking of which, you are not the only Obama in the White House who is faced some criticism of late, you know. The first lady, Mrs. Obama, was criticized for a high-calorie meal that she ordered at the Shake Shack, which is a new, popular burger spot in Washington, D.C. And I wonder if you think that that is fair, or do you think that is out of bounds? I have Michelle does not take that too seriously. Michelle knows that - well, let me put it this way. Michelle's never hid the fact that her favorite food is french fries, or that she is going to have a burger once in a while. The whole point that she is been making which is common sense, and so this should be a non-issue is how do we make sure that our kids, in particular, have balanced meals on a regular basis? Because it'll make them healthier; it'll make them do better in school; and it forms lifelong habits that will improve their quality of life. And you know, I think that she has been adamant about saying that there is nothing wrong with having a treat once in a while. There is nothing wrong with going ahead and having a milkshake or a piece of pie, or whatever else you crave. The question is, what what is it that on a regular basis you are doing, and what can we do as a society to make sure that, for example, folks in low-income communities have access to a grocery store that actually sells fresh - fresh produce? And in fact, she they did a wonderful announcement yesterday talking about food deserts, communities where you cannot - you know, in any reasonable way find fresh and healthy foods and if you do find it, then the prices are jacked up in those communities. And there was an announcement, cooperation from a whole bunch of retailers all across the country. They are going to - they are going to start building new stores that will not only create jobs but also give people healthier options. And that is what this is all about- - empowering people to have better options so that they can make better decisions for their family. It is not about people not having a hamburger once in a while. OK, but did she get the sweet potato fries or the regular never mind, I am not asking that. You know, she likes both, actually. She likes the sweet potato fries and the regular... And you should try them in the White House, too, because sometimes we make them, and they are outstanding. All right. Well, before we let you go, you have got a big birthday coming up in two weeks. And it is the big can we mention this? the big 5-0. You know, I feel real good about 5-0. The - obviously, I have gotten a little grayer since I took this job but otherwise, I feel pretty good. And Michelle, you know, says that, you know, she - she she still thinks I am , I am cute, you know. And I guess that is that is all that matters, is not it? Well, do you want anything special that we should pass along? Well... Anything special for the big birthday? You know, what I really want right now is to to get a debt-ceiling deal for my birthday. That is kind of sad, I know. And maybe some french fries... And maybe some you know, maybe I will have a good hamburger on my birthday as well. ENTITY joined us on the line from the White House. Thank you, ENTITY.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmichelmartinnationalpublicradio", "title": "Interview With Michel Martin of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-michel-martin-national-public-radio", "publication_date": "22-07-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 191, "text": "ENTITY, welcome. Thank you so much for having me. You have just been with 2,000 U.S. Marines. Some have been in harm's way, some are about to go in harm's way Iraq or Afghanistan under orders from you as the commander in chief. Was this difficult for you this morning? Well, it was not difficult because my main message was, number one, thank you. And the easiest thing for me to do is to express the extraordinary gratitude that I think all Americans feel for young men and women who are serving in our armed forces. And the second was to be very clear about our plans in Iraq, and that we are going to bring this war to an end. But I will tell you that the most sobering things that I do as president relate to the deployment of these young men and women. Signing letters of those who have fallen in battle it is a constant reminder of how critical these decisions are and the importance of the commander in chief, Congress all of us who are in positions of power to make sure that we have thought through these decisions free of politics and we are doing what is necessary for the safety and security of the American people. These specific Marines that were in this hall that you were talking to, as you said, you said in your speech that some of these kids are going to be going to Afghanistan soon as part of the That is exactly right. And you also said in your speech that it is one of the lessons of Iraq is that there are clearly defined goals. What are the goals for Afghanistan right now? Well, I do not think that they are clear enough, that is part of the problem. We have seen a sense of drift in the mission in Afghanistan, and that is why I have ordered a head-to-toe, soup-to-nuts review of our approach in Afghanistan. Now, I can articulate some very clear, minimal goals in Afghanistan, and that is that we make sure that it is not a safe haven for al Qaeda, they are not able to launch attacks of the sort that happened on 9/11 against the American homeland or American interest. How we achieve that initial goal, what kinds of strategies and tactics we need to put in place, I do not think that we have thought it through, and we have not used the entire arsenal of American power. We have been thinking very militarily, but we have not been as effective in thinking diplomatically; we have not been thinking effectively around the development side of the equation you know, what are we doing to replace poppy crops for Afghans that allow them to support themselves? Obviously, we have not been thinking regionally, recognizing that Afghanistan is actually an Afghanistan/Pakistan problem, because right now the militants, the extremists who are attacking U.S. troops are often times coming over the border from Pakistan. So that is why we have assigned an envoy, Richard Holbrooke, to work comprehensively in the region, and this review that we are talking about should be completed by the middle of next month. I will then be reporting to the American people and Congress about how exactly we are going to be moving forward in Afghanistan. As you know, ENTITY, there is a traditional language for these kinds of conflicts, and its victory, or its loss you win a war or you lose a war. Is there a victory definition for Afghanistan now or is that part of your thinking at this moment? I think there are achievable goals in Afghanistan, and the achievable goal is to make sure it is not a safe haven for terrorists, to make sure that the Afghan people are able to determine their own fate. One of the things that I think we have to communicate in Afghanistan is that we have no interest or aspiration to be there over the long term. There is a long history, as you know, in Afghanistan of rebuffing what is seen as an occupying force, and we have to be mindful of that history as we think about our strategy. Our goal in the region is to keep the American people safe. And I think that the more we can accomplish that through diplomacy, and the more we can accomplish that by partnering with actors in the region, rather than simply applying U.S. military forces, the better off we are going to be. But I do not want to pre-judge this review. That is why I have asked we are looking at a wide range of viewpoints that are being brought together, and a set of recommendations will be provided to me shortly. But in a kind of non-policy, public point of view, this all came about we are in Afghanistan because of 9/11. That is exactly right. And that was almost eight years ago. Yeah. So why are we still there? Well, my assessment is that we took our eye off the ball. I mean Iraq was an, obviously, enormous diversion of resources and attention. Now, we have had a long debate about the wisdom of having gone into Iraq in the first place, I do not want to re-litigate that. But just objectively, there is no doubt that had we stayed more focused on Afghanistan and the problems there and had we thought through more effectively Pakistan and its role in this whole process of dealing with extremists that we would probably be further along now than we are. But, you know, that is history. We now have to move forward. It is my job to come up with the best possible approach given some of these mistakes that have been made, and the fact that the situation right now has deteriorated badly in Afghanistan. But unlike you are what you talked about today, of course, is that a, quote, exit from Iraq, you are not even there yet in terms of when if and when and how we might exit from Afghanistan, if I hear you correctly? I think, until we have a clear strategy, we are not going to have a clear exit strategy. And my goal is to get U.S. troops home as quickly as possible without leaving a situation that allows for potential terrorist attacks against the United States. Keep in mind something that is important, and that is, Afghanistan is not a U.S. mission; it is a NATO mission. And one of the things that I think has been lost is the sense of international partnership in dealing with the problem of international terrorism. Part of our goal is, when I go to the NATO summit in April, to have a conversation with our NATO allies many of whom have put troops into Afghanistan, have made enormous sacrifices, have lost their own young men and women in the battle there to figure out how do we coordinate more effectively to move the ball forward. On Iraq specifically, you drew applause and shouts from some of the Marines when you went through what was accomplished in Iraq particularly Saddam Hussein fell, you went through a couple of other things. In general, should the Iraq mission now be seen as, quote, successful ? Well, I think what we can say unequivocally is that our military succeeded in every mission that was given to them. They consistently performed above and beyond expectations under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. I do not think that we can rightly say that the strategy cooked up by our civilian leadership with respect to either going in in the first place or how the war was managed was a success. But I think that we can say without equivocation that our military was successful. And if we get it right over the next few months and years, that there is the strong possibility that we can leave Iraq as a stable, peaceful partner in the region. Bottom line question, of course, ENTITY is, what was accomplished, has it been worth the 4,200 American lives, 35,000 wounded more than maybe 100,000 Iraqis who have been killed, to accomplish what has been accomplished? Well, you know, I do not want to look backwards. As you know, I opposed this war, I did not think it was the right decision, but I do not want to in any way diminish the enormous sacrifices that have been made by our men and women in uniform. I think the fact that Saddam Hussein is gone is a good thing. I think the fact that Iraq has now carried out a series of successful elections with diminished violence each time I think that is a good thing. A lot of the ultimate outcome in Iraq now is going to depend on how the political issues that have dogged Iraq for a very long time get resolved. And frankly we have not made the kind of progress over the last year to two years despite the surge we have not made the progress that needs to be made on the hydrocarbons law, the oil law, on making determinations about central government versus provincial government power. There are a whole host of political issues between the various factions and between Sunni, Shi'a and Kurd in Iraq that still have to be worked on and that is why I emphasized it in the speech. We have got to redouble our efforts when it comes to the diplomatic side if we are going to be successful. You have caught some heat as you know, ENTITY, today from some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress saying wait a minute, we are not supposed to have 50,000 troops still there or whatever. What is your the criticism being that the withdrawal is too slow and it is not as dramatic as they had expected, your colleagues, your supporters had expected. How do you answer that? Well, what I would say that is that they maybe were not paying attention to what I said during the campaign. I said that we were going to take 16 months to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq. We are now taking 18 months rather than 16. I said that we would have a residual force a transition force that could continue to stand up Iraqi security forces, provide them logistical support and training and also make sure that we are protecting U.S. civilian and military personnel. I said that we would have a counterterrorism capacity to make sure that al Qaeda or other extremist organizations did not try to take advantage of a diminished U.S. presence there. So everything that I said I would do during the campaign I am now doing. Obviously because of consultation with commanders on the ground something I also said we would do you know, there are some modifications to the plan. But this is basically the thrust that I have been talking about for several years. I think it is a responsible solution. It arrives at it was arrived at out of close consultation with commanders on the ground the CENTCOM Commander David Petraeus, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary Gates but also my secretary of state, my national security adviser, individuals who, like me, opposed the idea of going into Iraq in the first place. And yet we were able to arrive at a very strong consensus that has the support of our military brass, the folks on the ground, as well as our diplomats and our analysts. I think it is the right way to go. You are not the least bit uneasy over the fact as John McCain and John Boehner the Republican leader of the House have praised your plan while the Democrats are criticizing it? You know, I do not I do not make these decisions based on polls or popularity. I make the decisions based on what I think is best. This is consistent with what I said during the campaign. The fact if anything I think people should be interested in the fact that there is been a movement in the direction of what I thought was going to be the right plan in the first place. Go back to the first to where we began, ENTITY, where you are, the setting here and you are with some young people and some older people as well who One thing that is always striking when you talk to these extraordinary young people, they are awfully young, and they look younger to me every year. Yeah. Yeah, but the issue of making the decision to put them in harm's way, and when you ran for president it was discussed off and on all the time, of course, during the campaign, but now you are actually having to do it. How difficult is it? I do not mean I asked it in a different way to begin with, but just as in general, how difficult is it for you so far? You know, it will keep you up at night. I feel an enormous obligation to get it right, which is why I say the last thing I am thinking about is either applause or cat calls from the public or, you know, the cable stations as I am making these decisions. I feel a profound obligation to these troops and their families to make sure that the decisions I am making are the best possible decisions given the best possible information that I have having canvassed the widest range of viewpoints in order to keep the American people safe. And I think that is what we have done with respect to our Iraq decision. I think that is what we are aiming for with respect to our strategy in Afghanistan. And I hope that I never start feeling as if these decisions are easy. They should never be easy. I should always lose a little sleep when I am making these decisions. In a more general way, it is slightly more than five weeks now that you have been President of the United States, and we have been talking about Iraq and Afghanistan. We could go on and on and also talk about a lot of other things. I have got a full plate. You got a full plate. Yeah. Do you feel burdened by the full plate? I think that we are at an extraordinary moment that is full of peril but full of possibility. And I think that is the time you want to be president. I think there is a sense that right now, we are having to make some very big decisions that will help determine the direction of this country and in ways large and small the direction of the world for the next generation. And I will not lie to you. I wish that they were not all having to be made at once. It would nice to be able to stage them on one another. Sure. Let us you know, we will take, you know, the economy first and then we will take Afghanistan after that and then Iraq after that and Iran after that and, you know, the banking system somewhere out there autos, you know. It would be wonderful if we did not have all the planes in the air at the same time. But having said that, I meant what I said in my joint address to Congress. I think that there is there is something about this country where hard times, big challenges bring out the best in us. This is when the political system starts to move effectively. This is when people start getting out of the petty and the trivial debates. This is when the public starts paying attention in ways that they you know, when things are going well, you know, they have got better things to do than to think about public policy. You know, so I am I am invigorated by the challenges. But look, we have got a lot of big stuff ahead of us. Not every decision we are going to make is going to be perfect; not every plan that we lay out is going to work out exactly as we intended. But if we get the big stuff right then, you know, the ship of state is a big tanker and, you know, you cannot simply reverse direction on the economy or any of these things overnight, but you can start moving in a better trajectory so that five years, 10 years down the road you can say, you know, what, because of good decisions now, our kids are safer, more secure, more prosperous, more unified than they were before. And in a word, you feel like you are clicking now? Well, I feel like our team is making very good decisions based on the best possible information we have and the best options available to us. And that is all I can ask of myself or of them is that we are making the best decisions based on what is good for the American people. And, you know, this is a human enterprise. It is not going to be flawless, but I think that I think it is fair to say that you have not seen an administration who is had to come in and juggle this much stuff of such large import this quickly. And we are getting a lot of stuff done under that kind of pressure and I am very proud of the team and what we have done so far. ENTITY, thank you very much.

{"id": 61, "text": "ENTITY, thanks for talking with us. Thank you so much for being here. Did you or anyone else in your administration tell Tom Daschle he had to step down as your nominee? Well, you know, I am not going to go into the details of it as has been reported, Tom made the decision that he was going to be too much of a distraction to carry out what he is so passionate about, which is health care reform. What I did tell him was that I take responsibility for this mistake, I mean, I think that Tom took responsibility for the mistake on his taxes. I think it was an honest mistake, and I made the assessment, I made the judgment that he was the best person to achieve health care reform and bring people together, but what became clear to me is that we cannot send a message to the American people that we have got two sets of rules, one for prominent people and one for ordinary people and, you know, so I consider this a mistake on my part and one that I intend to fix and correct and make sure that we are not screwing up again. Well, the reason I ask is because yesterday in this office you were asked whether you supported him and you said, absolutely. Yeah. And it becomes clear from your answer that you played a role in the decision for him -- No, no, no, no. I do not want to misstate the issue here. Tom made the decision here. He called me and indicated this was his decision. Would you have continued to back him? Well, I do not want to get into hypotheticals, ENTITY. Here is what I will say. I think Tom is an outstanding person. I think this was an unintentional mistake on his part, but a substantial one and there is no excuse for the mistake. He took responsibility for it. Ultimately, I have to take responsibility for a process that resulted in us not having an HHS Secretary at a time when people need relief on their health care costs, and so, you know, this is a mistake, probably not the first one I am going to be making in this office, but what I am absolutely committed to doing is fixing it, getting a highly qualified HHS Secretary and then making sure that we start providing some health care relief to families who so desperately need it. On your first day in office, you signed an executive order on lobbyists. Right. That you said marks a, quote, clean break with business as usual, and yet in less than two weeks, you have signed waivers to allow the hiring of lobbyists to be Deputy Secretary at the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary at HHS and Chief of Staff at the Treasury. Is that a clean break? Well, that is three out of hundreds of appointments that we have made. But it is three of the top jobs in three really important departments -- But let me say this, ENTITY. We disclosed these ahead of time. We set a very high bar and everybody acknowledges that we have the toughest standards, not only of people who have lobbyists previously and the restrictions on them working in this White House, but also going forward and those rules will still apply. Let us turn to the economic stimulus plan and the bottom line question. Yeah. Will it work? You are taking hits right now from all sides, right and left. Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs calls it a, quote, astounding mishmash of tax cuts, public investments, transfer payments and special treats for insiders. Why not just pull it back, forget about the February 16th deadline and get it right? Well, I think, actually, that we are closer to getting it right than all these critics, partly because all these critics -- Alice Rivlin from the left, Martin Feldstein from the right. Hold on a second, ENTITY, you want me to answer your questions -- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It turns out that all these critics have contradictory suggestions, do not they? Some of them are saying, well, it does not spend out fast enough except it turns out that they also want infrastructure projects that might last for four or five or six years. There is no magic bullet to these situations. Here is what this package does. It provides payments like unemployment insurance to people who've lost their jobs and are in desperate need of help and every economist says that that is a smart thing to do because that gets the money out right away. It provides support for people who've lost their health care because they have lost their jobs, and I think that is the right thing to do for families. It also invests in green technologies, infrastructure, that will lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth and most of the criticisms that have been leveled and that you have heard on your show about various pet projects that members of Congress might have put in there, when you tally all those up amount to less than one percent of the entire package. The last point I'd make is that many of the critics what they are calling for are more tax cuts, when, in fact, this is already $300 billion worth of tax cuts and many of the people on the other side of the debate consider many of those wasteful, but you know, I actually think that Mitch McConnell is right, that we should have some tax cuts in this package. This is not going to be a package that makes everybody happy, but the main criteria I have is it going to put people back to work? And I think it actually will. Is the February 16th deadline firm? Yes, because nobody disagrees with the idea that if we keep on putting this off that we are going to end up seeing more months with half a million people losing their jobs each month. We cannot afford to wait. You reportedly told Senate Democratic leaders when you met with them yesterday that you want some changes in the bill. So let us do if we can, sir, I used to do this with you as a candidate, but I am going to ask you as ENTITY to do a lightning round of quick questions and answers about specific changes, tax credits for people who buy homes or businesses, good or bad? I think it has some potential and I am willing to take a look at it. Federally guaranteed lower mortgage rates? Our intention has always been that in addition to this recovery and reinvestment package that we are also going to have a housing bill, that we have also got to fix the banking system, that we are going to have to make sure that, for example, issues like executive compensation for banks that are getting money through the TARP that that is dealt with. I actually agree with Democrats and Republicans that we have got to do more to provide relief to homeowners to prevent foreclosure. Strip out by the Buy American provision for steel and iron in the bill, which a number of our allies are saying is too protectionist. I agree that we cannot send a protectionist message. I want to see what kind of language we can work on this issue. I think it would be a mistake though at a time when worldwide trade is declining for us to start sending a message that somehow we are just looking after ourselves and not concerned with world trade. Since you became ENTITY, you have warned Republicans, quote, You cannot just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done. Now, how do you know that is a quote? Well, I read it in the media. Yeah. Did you not say anything about Rush Limbaugh? Well, you know, I just want to -- I am not sure that was the exact quote. All right. Let me throw another one at you. All right. And you tell me whether this was an exact quote. You were widely quoted when you met with the House GOP Caucus saying, Go ahead, feel free to whack me, I will watch Fox News and feel bad about myself. That one I did say. Perhaps, let me just raise the possibility -- Yeah. Are you a trifle thinned-skin? No, no, no, I said it in good humor. I think everybody understood that that was a joke. No, I think, ENTITY, it is fair to say that I do not always get my most favorable coverage on Fox, but I think that is part of how democracy is supposed to work, you know, we are not supposed to all be in lockstep here and you have always been very gracious to me. And if that improves or hurts or my stock at Fox, but thank you. It may hurt it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithchriswallacefoxnews", "title": "Interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-chris-wallace-fox-news", "publication_date": "03-02-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 65, "text": "Thank you, ENTITY. Great to see you, ENTITY. Nice to see you. I will with health care. It''s probably the most quoted thing or requoted thing you have said in your presidency, If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. You said it a lot during the run-up. At this point, though, it''s obviously something - a promise that has not been able to be kept. Just today the Denver Post reported 250,000 people in Colorado are seeing health insurance policies cancelled. Some of those people like those policies, and they can''t keep them. What happened? Well, first of all, I meant what I said. And we worked hard to try to make sure that we implemented it properly. But obviously, we didn''t do enough - a good enough job, and I regret that. We''re talking about 5 percent of the population who are in what''s called the individual market. They''re out there buying health insurance on their own. A lot of these plans are subpar plans. And we put in a clause in the law that said, if you had one of those plans, even if it was subpar, when the law was passed, you could keep it. But there''s enough churn in the market that folks since then have bought subpar plans. And now that may be all they can afford. So even though it only affects a small amount of the population, you know, it means a lot to them, obviously, when they get - this letter cancelled. And - you know, I am deeply concerned about it. And I''ve assigned my team to see what we can do to close some of the holes and gaps in the law - because, you know, my intention is to lift up and make sure the insurance that people buy is effective, that it''s actually going to deliver what they think they''re purchasing because what we know is, before the law was passed, a lot of these plans, people thought they had insurance coverage, and then they''d find out that they had huge out-of-pocket expenses or women were being charged more than men. If you had pre-existing conditions, you just couldn''t get it at all. And we are proud of the consumer protections we put into place. On the other hand, we also want to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled; they can''t afford a better plan, even though they''d like to have a better plan. And so we''re going to have to work hard to make sure that those folks are, you know, taken care of. Do you feel like you owe these folks an apology for misleading them - You know - - even if you didn''t intentionally do it? But at this point, they feel misled. And you''ve seen the anger that''s out there. You know, I regret very much that what we intended to do, which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans because they want them, as opposed to because they''re forced into it - that, you know, we weren''t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place. And I want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in a good position - a better position than they were before this law happened. Keep in mind that most of the folks who are going to - who got these cancellation letters, they''ll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces, because they''ll have more choice, they''ll have more competition, they''re part of a bigger pool. Insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business. So the majority of folks will end up being better off. Of course, because the website''s not working right, they don''t necessarily know it, right? But even though it''s a small percentage of folks who may be disadvantaged, you know, it means a lot to them and it''s scary to them. And I am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me. We''ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and that we''re going do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this. You''ve been getting some tough criticism on this quote: Clarence Page, your hometown newspaper, Chicago Tribune. This is not a - not a columnist who likes to throw bombs inside this White House, usually pretty supportive of what you said. He characterized this as a political lie. He called it a sort of - the sort of rosy promise politicians sometimes make with such passion and confidence that they actually even themselves that it is true. Is that the position you found? Did politics play a role and you felt as if, as the Republicans were throwing stuff at the law, you''re trying to pass it, you''re trying to do this, that you shorthanded this? No, I - I think we, in good faith, have been trying to take on a health care system that has been broken for a very long time. And what we''ve been trying to do is to change it in the least disruptive way possible. I mean, keep in mind that there were folks on the left who would have preferred a single payer plan. That would have been a lot more disruptive. There were folks on the right who said let''s just get rid of, you know, employer deductions for health care and give people a - a tax credit and they can go buy their own health care in their own market . That would have been more disruptive. We tried to find a proven model, we''ve seen it work in Massachusetts, that would be as - as undisruptive as possible and, in good faith, tried to write the law in such a way that people could keep their care, although we really believe that ultimately they''re going to be better off when they''re buying health care through the marketplaces. They can access tax credits and they''re benefiting from more choice and competition. But obviously, we didn''t do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law. And you know, that''s something that I regret. That''s something that we''re going do everything we can to get fixed. In the meantime - By the way, that sounds like you''re supportive of this legislation, the various things that are out there - Well, we''re - we''re looking at a - a range of options. But the one thing I want to emphasize though, ENTITY, is everybody is acting as if the existing market was working. And the fact of the matter is that a whole lot of people who are in this individual market, who were buying health care on their own because they were not getting it through their employer - they might be happy with it this year, and then suddenly next year the cost got jacked up by 15, 20 percent. The average increase on premiums in this individual market for somebody who kept their health care for a while - the average increase was double digits. If they actually got sick and used the insurance, they might find the next year their premiums had gone up, or the insurers might have dropped them altogether because now they had a pre-existing condition. Women were being charged as much as double compared to men. So this is a market that wasn''t working, and a whole lot of people were dissatisfied. And what we''ve done is to increase the consumer protections that are in place for those families and those folks. We''ve said you can''t drop people when they get sick and need it most. We''ve said that you can''t, you know, have lifetime limits so that suddenly people think they''ve gotten insurance; the next thing they know, they''ve got $30,000, $40,000 out-of-pocket expenses. And over the long term, that is the right thing to do. But in this transition, you know, there are going to be folks who get a cancelation letter. Especially when a website''s not working, they''re looking at saying, well, what am I going to do now? And you know, we have to make sure that they are not feeling as if they''ve been betrayed by an effort that is designed to help them. Do you feel like, considering how much this has been - it''s late night, it''s all sorts of things - that - do you understand if people are going to be skeptical of the next promise you make, of the next - or are you concerned that people are going to be wondering, jeez, what''s the fine print that he''s not telling me? Do you get that people might be a little more skeptical? Forget the partisans here in Washington. Just average Americans. You know, I''ll tell you, ENTITY. I - I think that - I''ve now been in national public life for seven, eight years. I''ve been ENTITY for almost five. And I think for the most part, people know that I speak my mind and I tell folks what I think, and I''ve been very clear about what I''m trying to do. And I think most people know that - even if they disagree with me on certain issues - that I''m every day working hard to try to make life a little bit better for middle-class families who are - and folks who are trying to get in the middle-class, who are doing the right thing and being responsible. I think what most people, I hope, also recognize is that when you try to do something big, like make our health care system better, that there are going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you''re doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off. And I hope that people will look at the end product and they''re going to be able to look back and say, you know what? We now have protections that we didn''t have before. We''ve got more choice and competition. I didn''t have health insurance; I now have it. I had bad health insurance; I now have good health insurance. The website''s actually working. I''m getting - Well, I want to get to the website. I''m getting - you know, I''m getting - Right. - you know, my kid on my insurance plan even though he''s got asthma or some other pre-existing condition. So ultimately I think I''ll be judged on whether this thing is better for people overall. And in the meantime, even if it''s a small percentage of people - I mean, we''re talking about 5 percent of the population - Which is millions? - but - but that''s a significant number of people. Yeah. Even though a whole lot of them are going to be better off, there''s going to be a segment who, you know, I''ve ultimately got to make sure that, you know, I''m speaking to their needs and their concerns. And, you know, I take that very seriously, because I want everybody out there to know that, you know, my entire intention here is to make sure that people have the security of affordable health care. You have 21 days till November 30th. Yes. Is this website going to be running smoothly enough - if it''s not, at that point, do you sit there and say, OK, let''s extend the enrollment period, let''s delay the mandate? Do all of those plan Bs start coming into focus if November 30th isn''t hit? Well, let me just say generally - and I don''t think I''m saying anything that people don''t know and I haven''t said before - I am deeply frustrated about how this website has not worked over the first couple of weeks, and, you know, I take responsibility of that, my team takes responsibility of that, and we are working every single day, 24/7, to improve it. And it''s better now than it was last week, and it''s certainly a lot better than it was on October 1st. I am confident that it will be even better by November 30th and that the majority of people are going to be able to get on there, they''re going to able to enroll, they''re going to be able to apply, and they''re going to get a good deal - a better deal than they''ve got right now when it comes to buying health insurance. Now, that - you know, having said that - given that I''ve been burned already with a website - well, more importantly, the American people have been burned by a website that has been dysfunctional, what we''ve also been doing is creating a whole other set of tracks, making sure that people can apply by phone effectively, making sure that people can apply in-person effectively - so what I''m confident about is that anybody who wants to buy health insurance through the marketplace, they are going to be able to buy it. And - So no delays? You have no plans, or you might - - Well, keep in mind - keep in mind that the open enrollment period - the period during which you can buy health insurance - is available all the way until March 31st, and we''re only five weeks into it. So we''ve got a whole bunch of time not only to get the website fixed, to work out all the kinks, to make sure that everybody has the information that they need. And what we''ll do is continue to assess. If there are roadblocks for people, we''re going to clear out those roadblocks. We are going to make sure that they can access - So you''re open to whatever it takes? Whatever it takes for people to be able to get what is good-quality health insurance at cheaper prices or better insurance for the same price as bad insurance that they''ve got right now. We''re going to make sure that they have access to that market. Still have full confidence in Kathleen Sebelius? You know, I think Kathleen Sebelius, under tremendously difficult circumstances under the last 4 1/2 years, has done a great job in setting up the insurance markets so that there is a good product out there for people to get. You know, Kathleen Sebelius doesn''t write code. You know, she wasn''t our IT person. I think she''d be the first to admit that if we had to do it all over again that there would have been a whole lot more questions that were asked in terms of how this thing is working. But my priority right now is to get it fixed. And you know, ultimately, the buck - She''s still the right person to do it? Ultimately, the buck stops with me. You know, I''m the ENTITY. This is my team. If it''s not working, it''s my job to get it fixed. I want to talk about a larger question here. We''ve discussed the website issue, but there seems to be this growing perception - and some of it is via press reports; some of it''s your staff - that you''re not always on top of some things, or this idea that you didn''t know certain things. So for instance, we talked about the website; did the warnings get to your desk or not? NSA - did you - did you really not know we were tapping Angela Merkel''s phone until Edward Snowden leaked it? Well, look, these are two different issues. First of all, I can guarantee you that I''ve been more deeply involved in our intelligence operations on a whole set of a whole set of areas where there are real threats against us than just about any president - or let me put it this way, as much as any president. When I am presented intelligence, particularly if it pertains to allies like Germany, I''m not poking and probing about where we get certain information. You didn''t know this - you didn''t know this until after you learned it? The - if we''re talking about al-Qaida, if we''re talking about, you know, other states that pose a threat to the United States, then not only am I interested in the information but also how we obtained it, because that''s very relevant. There''s no doubt when it comes to the NSA generally that over the last, you know, 30, 40, 50 years we have tried to extend our intelligence capabilities all around the world. That''s what every intelligence agency does. What''s changed is technology. What''s changed is capacity. We''re just so much better than anybody else at this. And technology has given us so much more reach than in the past - All right, because I''m getting the wrap sign. I want to sneak in two more - Don''t worry. OK. Don''t worry, I''ll give you two other questions. All good. Thank you, sir. All right. You know, one of the lessons learned from this whole process on the website is that probably the biggest gap between the private sector and the federal government is when it comes to IT - how we precure - procure it, how we purchase it. This has been true on a whole range of projects. And you know what your supporters say? You had a great campaign website. I know. How did you - how did you not be able to do this? Right. Well, the reason is, is that when it comes to my campaign, I''m not constrained by a bunch of federal procurement rules, right? And how we write specifications and - and how the - the whole thing gets built out. So part of what I''m gonna be looking at is, how do we across the board, across the federal government, leap into the 21st century? Because when it comes to medical records for veterans, it''s still done in paper. Medicaid is still largely done on paper. When we buy IT services, generally it is so bureaucratic and so cumbersome that a whole bunch of it doesn''t work, or it ends up being way over cost. And you know, in some ways, I should have anticipated that just because this was important and I was saying this was my top priority and I was meeting with folks once a month telling them, make sure this works, understanding that you had some structural problems there - you know, that''s on me. That''s something that I''ve got to refocus on. And I actually think that once we get this particular website fixed, there are going to be some lessons learned that we can apply to the federal government generally. All right. Let me take advantage of those two more questions. High-level negotiations on easing sanctions against Iran start tomorrow, essentially this - or they''ve been going on, but there are some more talks tomorrow. Are you so sure you''re going to be able to trust the Iranians on some sort of temporary deal? Or how is it that you''re going to figure out if you trust them or not? What''s your measurement? Well, first of all, our job is not to trust the Iranians. Our job is to put in place mechanisms where we can verify what they''re doing and not doing when it comes to their nuclear program. and the negotiations taking place are not about easing sanctions. The negotiations taking place are about how Iran begins to meet its international obligations and provides assurances not just to us but to the entire world that they are not - So no sanctions get changed until they do something? - that they are not developing nuclear weapons, that their nuclear energy program is peaceful. And frankly, because of actions in the past, the world doesn''t trust them on that. That''s why we''re able to construct these sanctions that have squeezed them very hard. Our job now is to test how serious they are about resolving this conflict or this dispute through peaceful means, through diplomacy. And there is a possibility of a phased agreement in which the first phase would be us, you know, halting any advances on their nuclear program, rolling some potential back, and putting in place a way where we can provide them some very modest relief, but keeping the sanctions architecture in place, keeping the core sanctions in place, so that if it turned out, during the course of the six months when we''re trying to resolve some of these bigger issues, that they''re backing out of the deal, they''re not following through on it or they''re not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they''re not developing a nuclear weapon, we can crank that dial back up. So we don''t have to trust them. What we have to do is to make sure that there is a good deal in place from the perspective of us verifying what they''re doing and that they''re actually moving in the right direction. We can test it. We don''t have to dismantle sanctions to do it. If, in fact, that proves to be a possibility, then it''s greatly preferable to us ratcheting up that conflict higher and higher, which ultimately might lead to some sort of confrontation. And I''ve said that I won''t take any options off the table, including military options, to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But the best way to assure ourselves that Iran''s not getting a nuclear weapon is if we''ve got a verifiable means that they have decided themselves and are dismantling that program and international organizations can see what they''re doing and we can see what they''re doing. Last question. Did you really not know that your campaign was researching this idea of swapping Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton? You know, again, ENTITY, the - the problem that we''ve got - and this goes back to the earlier question you asked - you know, I am in charge of 2 million people in the federal government, and that was true, by the way, even when I was running for ENTITY. So people do all kinds of stuff. Some of it they clear with me. Sometimes they''re trying to figure something out, particularly on the political side, and I''m not somebody who delves into polling and all that data. Here''s the one thing I can say for certain: that if they had asked me, I would have said there is no way that I''m not running again with Joe Biden, because I genuinely believe that he has been one of THE best vice presidents in our history. He also happens to be a friend. He also happens to be one of my most important advisers on domestic and foreign policy. I like him. When my back''s up against the wall, he has my back. And - Must have been upset, then, when this leaked out. You know, I''ve now been in this town long enough to know that, you know, folks like to seem important by getting their version of events in the press or books or what have you, and you know, that''s just kind of part of the atmosphere that you live in. Did you and the vice president talk? Absolutely. And - and I - what I told him - and he knows and he believes me - is that I would not - I would not be here if it weren''t for the support that I''ve had from Joe Biden. He - he is a personal friend and adviser. It''s one of the best decisions that I''ve ever made, was selecting him as vice president. I couldn''t be prouder of the job that he''s done. All right.

{"id": 178, "text": "My message is, one, I am honored to come back. I am looking forward to visiting with your President; I am looking forward to seeing the beautiful country. And I bring a message of friendship. And we have had a long history together. We have got many ties, whether it be economic ties or political ties or ties of people on both people who live here in America that were born in Korea, and people who got relatives in Korea. There is a lot of ties. And we have had good relations in the past, we will have good relations in the present, and good relations in the future. I'd like to ask you about the . U.S. Agency for Geographic Names recently changed the country code of Dokdo from South Korea to undesignated sovereignty. Yes. From the Korean perspective, it may be seen as an act of acknowledging the Japanese claim of the ownership of the island. So are you willing to reverse the restore the original name or Korean sovereignty? First of all, this issue must be solved between South Korea and Japan. Secondly, I asked Secretary Rice to review the data, and I am pleased to tell you that the data has beenthe whole issue has been restored the way it was 7 days ago. Oh, really? Very good. Yes. Thank you very much, sir. In regard to free trade agreement, do you have any specific plan to persuade the Congress leadership into moving forward the approval of FTA within this year? First of all, the goal is to get it done this year. I told your President I would like to get it done this year. I am pressing hard. I am constantly talking about the importance of a free trade agreement with Korea to our interests. Yesterday I met with important business leaders of the Korean-U.S. Business Dialogue Council. I, one, made it clear to them that I am very much for this, and secondly, I made it clear to them that we have got to work a common strategy, that they have got to help us, on Capitol Hill, move the issue. I have told the President I make no promises, except I will push as hard as I possibly can to get it done before I leave the Presidency. Now I'd like to ask you about Korean-North Korea issue. Please. And the verification protocol is not completed yet. If you do not have the protocol until the 11th of next month, are you willing to reverse the process to rescind North Korea as state sponsor of terror? Yes, our position is very clear, and we have made that clear to our partners in the six-party talks, including your Government, that we expect there to be a verification regime that we are comfortable withnot only us, but that we are both comfortable with. After all, we are partners. And it is verification not only of a plutonium program, but verification of a highly enriched uranium program and verification of proliferation activities. And it is very important for us to get confidence that we are being told the full extent ofthe questions we are answering are beingasking are being answered fully. And so verification is a very important test as to whether or not North Korea wants to honor the agreement that they agreed to with all of us. And so, you know, some say, Well, he just wants to move forward. And the answer is, no, I want to have results. And it is very important for us to get something that we are comfortable with. And do you think the six-party nuclear negotiations can move toward to the third phase of dismantlement during your Presidency? Well, it all depends on whether or not we can complete the second phase. And that second phase is going to what matters in the second phase is whether or not we get a good verification process. There is a lot of people in this country saying, Why are you going forward when you cannot trust them? And my answer is, why do not we go forward with a process that will enable us to trust them? And so in order for us to get to the third phase we got to get through the second phase. And I will answer that question better when North Korea honors their commitments. We will honor our commitment, but they have got to honor their commitment. And as you mentioned in your question, are we comfortable with the verification? Well, until we are comfortable, then we do not move forward. Will North Korea give up their nuclear weapons ultimately? Do I think they will? That is the question. That is the fundamental question. And I cannot answer that for you. I know that it is good to put a process in place that gives them a chance to, in return for a different relationship with all of us. In the past it was, okay, we will give you something, North Korea, and hope you respond. What is changed is, you must honor your agreement, and then you can have a better relation. And there is a lotNorth Korea is the most sanctioned nation in the world. And we have agreed to take them off just one aspect of many of the other restrictions placed on them, if they perform. And so, to answer your question, I hope they give up their weapons programs. It will be good for the North Korean people if they do. There will be a different relationship between the United States and all the parties involved if the leader makes that choice. But it is his choice to make. We have made our choice; South Korea and the United States, China, Japan and Russia have made our choice. This sense that normalization of relations between U.S. and North Korea is still a long way to go. Do you have any plan to establish liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington? No. No? No, we do not . Our focus is on this relationship that with North Korea, bound in the six-party talks. Is that good? Very good. Thank you very much. You made some news today. Yes.

Are you going to inherit a recession from President Clinton? And President Clinton, what are your thoughts about that? I really do not have any comments. I look forward to talking to the President. I am so honored that he extended his hospitality to me and my wife yesterday. He did not need to do this, and I am most grateful that he would do so. what do you think about a recession? Well, a recession is two quarters in a row of negative growth. I do not think we are going to have that. But we could not keep up 5 percent growth a year forever. I think 49 of the 50 blue chip forecasters think that growth will be 2.5 percent or better next year, and that will keep unemployment low. But I think there will be things to be managed. He will have economic challenges, and you ought to give him a chance to meet them, if not try to figure it all out in advance. Are you going to What advice do you have for him, Mr. President? My only advice to anybody in this is just to get a good team and do what you think is right. Are you going to North Korea? No decision has been made on that. We have been talking, our people have, about what we have attempted to do in North Korea. It is interesting, when I had this meeting 8 years ago with the President-elect's father, he told me that the biggest problem that we were facing was the nuclear program in North Korea. And we were able to build on the work they had done and put an end to that. And now the big problem there is the missile program. We may have a chance to put an end to it, and if we can, I think we should. But this is something that I want to consult with the President-elect and his team about, and we will see what the facts are, and I will try to do what is best for the country. Governor, I understand that you are not against him going. Is that right? I have not had a chance to talk to the President yet, Helen . We have got to talk about this. What will you tell him is the biggest problem, Mr. President? I want to talk to him, not you. He can talk about that. I waited 8 years to say that. Governor, how different is it to come to this house in your position now than what it was as a family member? It is vastly different. It is such a huge honor to come as the Presidentelect. I do not think I will really fully realize the impact until I swear-in. I suspect the President would say the same thing. I am humbled and honored, and I cannot thank the President enough for his hospitality. He did not need to do this. Yes, he did. It is protocol. I had not quite finished yet. Go ahead and finish. And I am grateful. And I look forward to the discussion. I am here to listen. And if the President is kind enough to offer some advice, if he is, I will take it in. Are there questions you have for the President, sir? If there are, I am going to ask it in private and afterwards not share them with you.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexchangewithreporterspriordiscussionswithpresidentelectgeorgewbush", "title": "Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President-Elect George W.

I do not think it is a hoax, I think there is probably a difference. But I do not know that it is man-made. I will say this. I do not wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars. I do not wanna lose millions and millions of jobs. I do not wanna be put at a disadvantage. I wish you could go to Greenland, uh, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels. And you do not know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You do not know. Well, your scientists, your scientists No, we have At NOAA and NASA We have scientists that disagree with that. You know, I I was thinking what if he said, No, I have seen the hurricane situations, I have changed my mind. There really is climate change. And I thought, Wow, what an impact. What an impact that would make. Well I am not denying. I am not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we are talkin' about over a millions But that is denying it. of years. They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael. Who says that? They say ? People say. People say that in the Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it is worse than ever? Uh. . . you'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, ENTITY. I cannot bring them in. Look, scientists also have a political agenda. Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist Yes. Yes. . . .the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis? And did the prince give the order to kill him? Nobody knows yet, but we will probably be able to find out. It is being investigated. It is being looked at very, very strongly. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it. And den deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes. Jared, your son-in-law. Got on the phone and asked the prince. Did he deny it? Did he They deny it. They deny it every way you can imagine. In the not-too-distant future, I think we will know an answer. What are you options? Let us say they did. What are your options? Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of Senators have proposed? Well, it depends on what the sanction is. I will give you an example. They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it. So would you cut that off Do I, well, I tell you what I do not wanna do. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com I do not wanna hurt jobs. I do not wanna lose an order like that. There are other ways of uh, punishing, to use a word that is a pretty harsh word, but it is true. Tell everybody what is at stake here. You know, this is- Well, there is a lot at stake. There is a lot at stake. And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter. There is something you will be surprised to hear me say that. There is something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case. So we are gonna have to see. We are going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment. You have had a string of wins lately. Let us see, the economy, the d the trade deal- Right. With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh And South Korea. And South Korea. And Kavanaugh, the confirmation. There has been no Administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years Say this modestly. Well, it is not even that, it is a fact. Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history. What about North Korea? Talking about accom Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement. Look, we You say so far ? It is always so far, till everything's done. I I you know, deals are deals, okay? Whether it is a real estate deal or a retail deal, it does not matter. But, I will say this. The day before I came in, we were going to war with North Korea. I sat with President Obama We were going to war? and we were gonnaI think it was going to end up in war. And my impression is and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get. Does not get any tougher than that. Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough. We were going to war with North Korea. Now, you do not hear that. You do not hear any talk of it. And he does not wanna go to war, and we do not wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he is agreed to it. And you see that, he is agreed to it. No missiles. Do you trust him? I do trust him, yeah, I trust him. That does not mean I cannot be proven wrong Why would you trust him? about it? Well, first of all, if I did not trust him, I would not say that to you. Would not I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes Well, remember what Reagan said. Trust, but verify. Sure. I know. It is it is very true. But the fact is, I do trust him. But we will see what happens. But is it true that they have not gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles- They want to With nuclear And I will tell you that they are closing up sites. But Setting it up. Is what I said true, that they have not ? Gotten Well, nobody really knows. I mean, people are saying that. I have actually said that. What? That they are still building missiles, more missiles? We do not really know, ENTITY. We really do not know. But I assume Suspect that? Let us say the answer is yes, okay? In the meantime, they have not tested a missile. They have not tested a rocket. They definitely have not done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast. It sort of moves the earth. And we have a relationship now. One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions. We have not done that. Are you prepared to do that? - No, No. I What what does he have to do before you are No I am not doing it. This is not the Obama administration. I have not eased the sanctions. I have not done anything. I have not done anything. We are meeting. I believe he likes me. I like him. We have a good relationship. It is very important. I wanna read you his resume, okay? He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions. This is a guy you love? Sure. I know all these things. I mean I am not a baby. I know these things. I know, but why do you love that guy? Look, look. I I I like I get along with him, okay? But you love him. Okay. That is just a figure of speech. No, it is like an embrace. It well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to get the job done. He is a bad guy. Look. Let it be whatever it is. I get along with him really well. I have a good energy with him. I have a good chemistry with him. Look at the horrible threats that were made. No more threats. No more threats. China. I get along with him. It is very important. China, let us go. I am skipping across the world here. You have slapped a lot of tariffs $250 billion. Gonna do more? Might. Might. Round three? They wanna negotiate, ENTITY. They wanna negotiate. Are you ready? Look. Are you ready to I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China. I do not know that that is necessarily going to continue. I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things. And how how And I said we cannot do that, and we are not gonna do that anymore. How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this? So, so far, that has not turned out to be the case. Some if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%, again. But they have retaliated. That is what I am asking. They can retaliate, but they cannot they do not have enough ammunition to retaliate. We do $100 billion with them. They do $531 billion with us. Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression? No. No, although they are down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929. Well that is what I am asking. I do not want that. No, I do not want that. I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us. I want them to open their markets like our our markets are open. But you are in a And it will be a fair deal trade war right now. Trade war. You call it war, I do not call You you it you did today. I called it a skirmish. I heard you, you called it a war. I called it, actually I called it a battle. But, actually, I am gonna lower that. I consider it a skirmish. And we are gonna win. You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies. I mean, what is an ally? We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people. But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that is what they have done. But this is hostile. And yet, they it is not hostile. It sounds hostile. You know what is hostile? The way they treat us. We are not hostile. No, but cannot you deal with We have been we have been them without the stupid country for so many years. Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance? Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine. But you know what? We should not be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe. And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade. They are not going to do it anymore. They understand that. Okay, but are youit does seem thisare you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance? It is been going for 70 years. It is kept the peace for 70 years. You do not know that. You do not know that. I do not know what? You do not know that. Is it true General Mattis said to you, The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III? No, it is not true. What is not true? Frankly, I like General Mattis. I think I know more about it than he does. And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you. I am gonna try one more time. Okay. I know and, ENTITY, you do not have to try again. I know exactly what you are saying Well, answer my question. The answer is this. I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way. I am fully in favor of NATO, but I do not wanna be taken advantage of. Putin. Yeah. Okay, people do not understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin. Okay, you ready? I do not understand it. I have been you do not know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference No, I mean publicly. You never say anything harsh about him Excuse me. publicly. I did not ? I am the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers. Obama did not . You know what he sent? He sent pillows and blankets. I am the one and he is the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin I think I am very tough with him personally. I had a meeting with him. The two of us. It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting. Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations? In poisonings? Probably he is, yeah. Probably. I mean, I do not Probably? Probably. But I rely on them, it is not in our country. OK, Why, why not they should not do it. This is a terrible thing. Of course they should not do it. And that is your Do you believe, do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign, uh, election? Our election- Well, they they meddled. But I think China meddled too. But why do you say China meddled too? And I think other countries And you wanna know something? Why do you say Chi why do not you just say Well, let me ask you the Russians meddled? Because I think China meddled also. And I think, frankly, China This is amazing. is a bigger problem. You are diverting the whole Russian thing. I am not doing anything. You are, you are I am saying Russia, but I am also saying China. What about the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions? Well, we will see what happens come midterms. But But everybody thinks, given the things you have said He. . .I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that. I was very disappointed. Why should he have recused himself? So I was very So disappointed but So can I assume we will see what happens. Can I assume he is gone? No. No. You cannot assume that. Will you. Will you pledge pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation? Well, I I do not pledge anything. But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that. I think it is a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind. But you will not pledge There is no collusion. I do not wanna pledge. Why should I pledge to you? If I pledge, I will pledge. I do not have to pledge to you. But I have- Well I have no intention of doing that. Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election? Give me a break. They would not be able to help me at all. Call Russia. It is so ridiculous. So you have been ENTITY for almost two years. Is there anything that you wish you had not said, anything you wish you had not done? Do you have any regrets? So when I won the presidency, I th I I the press treats me terribly. I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. ENTITY, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest. Okay, is this. . this is what you regret? I regret that the press treats me so badly but I am I am really asking do you And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so. Have you made any mistakes? That is my question. Everybody makes mistakes. And what have been yours? I could have been uh, earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal. The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders. I was getting to know countries. I did not wanna do it right outta the box. So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier. What about the forced separation of children from their migrant children from their. . . Yeah. Well, that was the same as the Obama law. You know, Obama had the same thing. It was on the books, but he did not enforce it. Youenforced it. You launched that the zero tolerance policy be. . .to deter families with children coming No, but then everybody decided and the courts do not want separation. And frankly, when you do not do separa when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country. So are you gonna go back to that? Well, we are looking at a lot of things. Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were they are a laughing stock all over the world. Are you willing though I think that you are saying you are it is under consideration. No, I want all the laws changed. But the children specifically there have to be consequences, ENTITY, for coming into our country illegally. And part of the r I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States. Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no. Go ahead. Are you willing to reinstitute that policy? You said, We are looking at everything. I will Yes or no. I will only I cannot you cannot say yes or no. What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally. I am not gonna ask it again You do not have to. Because I know you will not But it is the same as Obama. Okay. Changing subjects again you are the first ENTITY of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military. You come up here, you have been here for almost two years, what is the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you have been ENTITY? Okay. So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah. Now I say they are babies. Who is the toughest? They are babies, the political people. This is the most deceptive, vicious world. It is vicious, it is full of lies, deceit and deception. You make a deal with somebody and it is like making a deal with that table. Give me an example. Well, I do not wanna give you an example. I am not lookin' to in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I have been able to do. Remember that. When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at making deals with other countries. Nobody's been able to do anything like this. Actually, most people did not even try because they knew they did not have the ability to do it. But, it is a very deceptive world. The other thing I have really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was. I I and I really mean it. I am not saying that as a sound bite. I never I'd like to Knew how dishonest I am I am gonna change the subject again. Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation. When I say Obama did it, you do not wanna talk about it. No, I am gonna run your When I say I did it, let us make a big deal of it. I am gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so. I am just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject. I disagree, but I do not wanna have that fight with you. Hey, it is okay All right, I will get in another fight with you ENTITY, it is okay. In the meantime, I am ENTITY and you are not. This country is divided, polarized. Within families, there are not even people who can talk to each other. What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and Yeah I think that anger? what is going to happen I think the economy's bringing people together. It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama. I can see the country uniting. I can see it. We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh you, you know what I am saying. But when you won that. During the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly. But when you won, you won. No no one is gonna argue with that. I won You won. And then after you won, instead of saying, Oh, let us all come together, this is wonderful. Let us heal all of this, you come out and bash the Democrats. Well, I bashed their attitude. I bashed their statements But why not try to Because they were bring us together? so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh. I have never But why not seen anything like it. why not try and we need to be healed. We need I do not think they want to heal yet, I will be honest. Well, you do not wanna heal yet. I think I, I, I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement. I do not think they wanna be healed. I do wanna heal. I am n I am not talking about Democrat I am talking about the country. You go out and you go to Mississippi. The famous Mississippi speech? And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford. You mimicked her. Had I not made that speech, we would not have won. I was just saying she did not seem to know anything. No you And you are trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary. Why did you have to make fun of her? I did not really make fun of her. Well, they were laughing. What I said the person that we are talking about did not know the year, the time, the place. Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and and was asked what is the worst moment. And she said, When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense. Ehh, uhh. And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her. They can do what they I I will tell you this. The way now-Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms. Have you seen what is gone on with the polls? But did you have to Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I will I will And but be honest with you. but do you think you treated her with There are those that think she should not have Do you think you treated her with respect? I think so, yeah. I did. But you seem to be saying that she lied. W you know what? I am not gonna get into it because we won. It does not matter. We won. Well. . . The Anonymous column that ran in The New York Times. The author, we do not know who it is. Whoever it is Whoever it is. Maybe it was The New York Times too. Huh. . . .paints a picture. No, no, it is By the way, you do not know how dishonest The New York Times is. It could've been The New York Times. I doubt it. But it could've been. Okay. I doubt it too. It also could've been any w well, do not count on it. It also could've been any one of 3,000 people. You have said that this administration is like a smooth-running machine. And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos. It is wrong! It is so false. It is fake news. I am changing things around. And I am entitled to. I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal. They will come into the Administration, they will be phenomenal. More people gonna go? Yeah, other people will go, sure. Because so many people, you have kind of a record of on turnover. I think I have a great Cabinet. There're some people that I am not happy with. Who are you not happy with? No, I do not wanna say that but Come on. No, I do not want to say that. But I have some people that I am not thrilled with. And I have other people that I am beyond thrilled with. What about General Mattis? Is he going to leave? Well, I do not know. He has not told me that. I have Do you want him to a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he is sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That is Washington. The first lady. Yes. Melania. She said that there are still people in the White House that she does not trust and that you should not trust. I feel the same way. I do not trust everybody in the White House, I will be honest with you. You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, Is he wearing a wire I am usually -or whatever? Not so much a wire. I am usually guarded. And I think I am guarded anyway. But I am not saying I trust everybody in the White House. I am not a baby. It is a tough business. This is a r this is a vicious. . . place. Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place. The attacks, the the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back. but you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here. It takes a president a while to find his sea legs. I think so. I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I am the ENTITY of the United States, but I think that is true with everybody. POTUS. Now I very much feel like POTUS. I do. I feel like the ENTITY. You know, for a little while, it is like ENTITY, sir. It is even my friends, they call me, they they do not call me Donald they call me ENTITY. And I say, Will you please loosen up? I have learned on the job. I have. And you feel comfortable?

{"id": 458, "text": "Mr. ENTITY, as we look ahead into 1984, we would ask that you address six of the most critical foreign policy issues that concern Americans. First, in the year ahead, how do you propose to rebuild a working relationship with the Soviet Union and revive meaningful arms control negotiations? We can do it, because those negotiations are as much value to the Soviet Union as they are to anyone else. Even more important. I have to point out that, with all this talk about the supposed strain in relations, there is an inference that somehow it is our fault. But we did not kill Russian citizens by shooting down a civilian airplane. We did not attempt to conquer an adjacent country to ours. We did not walk out on negotiations and refuse to give a date for when we would resume. If there is a strain, it has not been caused by us. Do you believe the extended absence of Andropov from the picture where under certain circumstances you might have been able to have a meaningful exchange with him is affecting this relationship with the Soviets? I still think we can continue to deal with them and resolve problems between us. The biggest problem we all face is achieving genuine peace in the world. I do not think they want a confrontation any more than we do. We will be at that negotiating table when the Soviets decide to come back ready to negotiate in good faith. We have never broken off communications. We have at several levels continued to meet with the Soviets and we are ready. I know, on the other hand, that the absence of Andropov must have had some influence on their side on exactly what could be done. I believe that the Soviet Union has more to gain than we, or anyone else, in taking a look at changing the situation and, in effect, them joining the family of nations the way the rest of us have who are concerned with peace. Issue number two deals with the Middle East. A main concern is Lebanon. Do you believe that in 1984 it is going to be possible to withdraw our marines? And will it be feasible to do that only if and when a stable government is able to unify Lebanon? Yes, it will be possible to withdraw the marines in 1984. And that applies as well to the whole multinational force. Let me remind you why we sent the marines to Lebanon as part of the multinational force. Our whole idea all along has been to bring peace to the Middle East area generally and to act as a kind of go-between to bring these warring nations together. But Lebanon stood in the way. You will remember that in the summer of 1982 Beirut was being shelled in every direction, and in 1976 the authorities there had asked the Syrians to come in and help keep order, because the Government of Lebanon was virtually nonexistent and powerless to do anything about it. The multinational force moved in and created conditions that led to the partial withdrawal of the Israelis. Now there has been a change in Syria's position. Even after a request from the Lebanese Government to withdraw, the Syrians have refused, and they are still there. We believe that the purpose of the multinational force would be accomplished with the withdrawal of the other foreign powers and the establishment of a stable Lebanese Government, supported by a rebuilt Lebanese Army. We have done a fine job of training and equipping the Lebanese Army. It needs to be some bigger than it is. But it is a good and a well-trained force. And it has performed well. The idea was that as the foreign forces left and as the Lebanese forces moved out toward their borders to reinstitute control and stop the internecine fight, the multinational force would maintain order for example, in areas like Beirut because the Lebanese military could not do both. This is still the goal. Is that still a realistic goal? I think that, with all that is happening, we are overlooking the progress that is been made. At recent discussions in Geneva, all of those involved even those who are presently hostile agreed to recognize the Gemayel government as the legitimate Government of Lebanon. Another sign of progress is the fact, as I mentioned, that the Lebanese Army has been brought up to a capability it did not have before. But now further progress hinges particularly on Syria, which is the stopping block in its refusal to withdraw even though it had once agreed to leave and said that if Israel left, it would leave. I do not say that the multinational force has to stay until all those foreign forces are out. I think that even if they gave an assurance that they are going to go and start the process maybe we could then leave. Subject three: With the prospect of continuing widespread terrorist attacks, how can the United States retaliate, especially when such attacks are inspired or sponsored by governments? One of the hardest things, of course, is to prove that the terrorist attacks are sponsored by a government. For example, these groups that are taking credit for the recent suicide attacks are believed to have an Iranian connection. There is a faction of Iranians that believe in a holy war. We do have the evidence that Khomeini has spoken a number of times about advocating a holy war in the Moslem world to promote his type of fundamentalism. So, it is hard not to believe that he must, in some way, instigate or at least egg on those that are doing these things. What can be done to counter the terrorist threat? I believe that if terrorists are claiming triumphs when they do these terrible deeds, acknowledging what their goal is and that they have a connection with some country then I think it is up to the government of that country to try to curb and control such groups. If some of our own terrorist groups commit these outrages such as the group that just bombed a naval recruiting station in New York it is our responsibility to corral them, find out who and what they are, and bring them to justice. But the same is true for all the other countries. But the one thing we cannot do is what so many people, even here in our own country, are advocating in the face of the terrorist attacks against our forces in Lebanon. That is to bring home the marines from Lebanon. If terrorism can succeed in its goal, then the world is going to find itself under the control of the terrorists. You have to stand against that and not let it succeed. What do you do if a government is actually responsible, as you say, for instigating terrorism? Can you really ask that kind of a government to assume responsibility for controlling these terrorists? In those cases, I think that the civilized world has to get together and see what action can be taken. This does not necessarily mean warlike action, but pressures that can be put on a government-pressures such as saying to that government, You start taking some steps to control this, or you will be outlawed in the rest of the world. Another issue; you are going to China in the spring. What, in your view, is going to be necessary to develop closer relations with that country, particularly in the strategic field? And do U.S. ties with Taiwan inhibit the process of improving relations with China? I do not think they do. I know that the People's Republic of China is uncomfortable with our position on Taiwan. But we have reiterated time and time again to them that the people of Taiwan are longtime friends and, in fact, once were allies of ours. We have recognized that there is one China and that its capital is Peking. But we believe that the differences between Peking and Taiwan should be settled by peaceful negotiations. We cannot cast aside one friend in order to make another. We have argued to representatives of the People's Republic that they themselves should take some comfort from that because it is assurance to them that we would not throw them aside to make friends with someone else. I think we have made great progress. I know that sometimes the Government of the People's Republic has to speak out about this issue, but our trade relations and cooperation in the area of high technology, all of these things represent milestones and successive steps in improving our relations. Now, the head of their government is coming here, and I am going there in the spring. We are going to find other areas where we can improve and increase our relationship cultural exchanges, things of that kind. All of this, I think, is on a good track. We have made some gains. Fifth: What strategy does the administration intend to pursue in Central America? Is it to underwrite the Government of El Salvador indefinitely? And in Nicaragua, is it to settle for nothing less than the overthrow of the Sandinistas? Our policy in Central America is regional. This is very much what the Contadora process is. We are supporting the efforts of the Contadora group Mexico, Venezuela, Panama, and Colombia-to assure that democratic elections are used to settle the internal political conflicts and that verified agreements assure peace among the countries. Now, as for the El Salvador Government: There has been important progress in recent years achieving democratic ideals, practices, and policy. They are beset by Cuban- and Soviet-backed insurgents who do not want that kind of government. They want the old-fashioned idea that we have seen for the last few hundred years the idea that if you have a revolution, it is only to exchange one set of rules for another set of rulers. For once, we have got a government there that says: No. This is to be revolution to change that process. At the same time that the Government in El Salvador is fighting against this potent enemy on the left, they are being harassed from behind by small violent right-wing groups who want to go back to the old concept of government over the people, not by the people. So, we should not be blaming the present Government of El Salvador for not being able to deal effectively with these rightists when it is beset by this other force on the left. I think that the thing that is dragging this out are the limitations placed on our aid by the Congress. It is almost as if they are saying, Well, we will give you just enough to let them bleed to death slowly. What we really need and remember that threefourths of our aid is for economic and social reforms, and the other 25 cents out of each dollar is for military aid is the kind of aid that will let them accomplish the job and eliminate this left-wing guerrilla force that is doing the attacking. At the same time, wherever we can, we should help them find out these behind-the-scenes moves by the violent right that we will not accept. And where the government needs help in dealing with this, we should help. That was one of the missions that Vice President Bush performed when he was in El Salvador recently. I think some progress has been made in that regard. But we should not let the violent right keep us from doing what is necessary to end the war that is going on. And Nicaragua-is overthrow of the Sandinistas the U.S. policy? No. We are not demanding the overthrow of that government. All they have to do is go back to the 1979 democratic commitments they made to the OAS as part of the political agreement leading to the end of the Somoza regime. Remember, the U.S. gave them immediate diplomatic recognition and significant financial aid until we found out that one faction of the revolutionaries was exiling or imprisoning their more democratic partners in the revolution, who discovered the Sandinistas intended to have a totalitarian form of government. Now, the Sandinistas' promises of human rights, of democratic principles, of free elections, union rights, and so forth-all of those promises were made in writing to the Organization of American States when they persuaded the OAS, during the revolution, to persuade Somoza to resign, which he did. They have not kept that contract. Some of the leaders of the contras were fighting alongside of them in the revolution and then were ousted, just as Castro ousted the same kind of people and imprisoned some of his best lieutenants because they would not go along with him to a Communist, totalitarian form of government. Nicaragua could solve its problem right now. If this Nicaraguan Government wants to go back to the promises of the revolution, we will step in and help. And what is the sixth issue? It deals with the use of power. The other day you spoke of the end of the days of weakness with the rebuilding of American military power. How do you envision the use of military power in pursuit of this country's foreign policy? Mainly, what we are talking about is deterrence. I have always believed in fact, the Chinese had this idea thousands of years ago that your army is really doing its job if it never has to fight. I view it from that standpoint. After years and years of unilateral disarming on our side, with this country canceling weapons systems and so forth for domestic political reasons, the Soviets did not have to give anything up. I think it was all explained in my favorite cartoon. It was the cartoon that portrayed Brezhnev when he was still alive, and it had him talking to a Russian general. Brezhnev said, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. Now, the Soviets have found out they are facing a belated U.S. modernization program which will assure the effectiveness of our deterrent. I think that is the only reason they came to the table to discuss arms reductions. They have come to realize that we will do whatever is necessary to make it evident that hostile moves on their part would result in equal or greater punishment to them. That is the purpose of our military buildup, and it certainly worked in Geneva.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarvinstoneandjosephfrommusnewsworldreport", "title": "Interview With Marvin Stone and Joseph Fromm of U.S. News & World Report", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-marvin-stone-and-joseph-fromm-us-news-world-report", "publication_date": "15-12-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 502, "text": "The 40th ENTITY When historians write about the Reagan administration, what do you want them to say? You know, I have been asked that, and I guess I have to say, I have never thought that far ahead. I am so busy thinking about what we want to accomplish. I guess maybe just that I helped perpetuate this great American dream. What do you hope for in the next 3 years? There are so many things. I would like to get us definitely on the pattern of reducing the deficit so that the balanced budget is in view. I would like to have, then, going into effect at that time a balanced budget amendment so we could never again go a half a century, as we have, of regularly deficit spending each year. And I would like to see us also have some plan for beginning installments to start reducing the national debt, as we have done many times in the past. There are a number of things that I would like to see resolve the problem of prayer in schools and have us on the road, a good solid road that could make us optimistic about the chances for peace. On the budget deficit, it seems as if members of your own party are not totally in accord with you. The Congress has not supported you. Are you optimistic? David Stockman said maybe this is the last chance, but you are optimistic about the future? Yes, I am. There is no way that anyone could ever balance the budget in 1 year. This budget, over the years, has been structurally built into our budgeting process. And the difficulty, of course, is getting agreement not on the need to reduce it everyone seems to agree on that but then trying to get them to agree on, well, where do you apply the tourniquet and shut off that hemorrhage of funds. But I think that we are on the beginning of a track where we can see a progression of reducing the deficit as a percentage of gross national product. You know, if you just count the deficit in dollars and it looks so horrifying and you say, How did this ever happen? Well, if you look at it back over these 50 years of deficit spending on the basis of what it is as a percentage of gross national product, that, too, has been growing bigger. So, it is not as far out of line with past deficits; some of them were just about as big as this one is in that percentage. But if we can get on a percentage to where, for these next 3 years what we have in mind is if we can get it next year down to 4 percent of the gross national product, 3 percent the following year, 2 percent the next year, we think that that progression will point us to, by 1990, a balanced budget and then you could have go into effect the balanced budget amendment. I spoke to an influential Republican Senator on Sunday who felt that, possibly, the tax reform measure might be diverting attention away from deficit reduction. Do you see that as a complement to it or possibly a stimulant for it? Actually, a stimulant for it in a way, because if you look back, not just in our administration and what we did in 1981 when we implemented or began implementing our tax cuts, but go back to President Kennedy's across-the-board tax cut, before that to President Coolidge and the tax cuts that he implemented in every instance the economic growth has resulted in the Government getting more revenues at the lower rates than it was getting at the higher rates. So, I think this tax reform very definitely would help. It is not aimed at being a part of that, but it would help in that it would stimulate economic growth and I think would actually, thus, result in increased revenues. This has been spoken of as a profamily tax measure. How will that help the families in your estimate? Well, let us start right off with someone down there at the lower end of the earning scale. One of the features of this is that the personal exemption is increased to $4,000 and then the deduction for dependents is almost doubled to $2,000 apiece instead of the present 1,040. So, you take a family of four, you have got $8,000 of nontaxable income to begin with right there. And that plus the reduced rates we believe that and first of all, so many of our people cannot and do not take advantage of many of the loopholes that others have been able to use to reduce their fair share of the tax burden. So, it is very definitely aimed at families and that was sort of proven the other day when the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives-so, I am not just citing a Republican measure-in the Committee on Children, Youth, and Family have made a study of this tax proposal plus all the others that are before the Congress and said flatly this one is the most profamily of all of the tax proposals. Is the $2,000 personal exemption, dependent's exemption, is that a non-negotiable feature? Would you veto a bill if it did not have that in it? I think it just has to have it, and let me give you my thinking on that. Some years ago, as you know, that deduction was $600 and then inflation took hold and has kept coming on. And finally, someone got around to increasing the 600 to 1,040. But right now, actually, if we had kept up with inflation, the deduction should be $2,700. Now, we could not remain revenue neutral and go that high, but going to $2,000 is eminently justified simply on the matter of that actually, in purchasing power, that is smaller than the $600 was back in 1948. There is no lobby for it, though; among the people, the vast numbers will help. So would you, in a sense, be their champion and go the mount on that issue? Yes, and I have to say, though, that I have not heard here, from Democrats or Republicans, any objection to those figures. There have been some of the loopholes or deductions, other areas that people have thought should be retained, and there is been argument about that. But I have not heard anyone raise a complaint about these personal exemptions. One oblique question. I read that the reason that you and Franklin Roosevelt were so tremendously popular is because you gave the American people hope. Looking down the road, what cause do you have for hope? Well, I am an eternal optimist, I know; but I cannot help but have hope. Just a few years ago, we were seeing our streets torn up with rioting and demonstrations of various kinds, but we also were seeing a lack of hope. We were hearing talk that we were no longer a nation of growth and so forth; that we must begin to limit ourselves in our expectations, and our government itself was telling that to the people. And here, today, in these few short years, double-digit inflation is down to less than 4 percent and still on its way down; interest rates, the prime rate had reached 21 1/2 percent, and it is down to far less than a half of that now, and still, I believe, they are going down. In the last 33 months, we have created more than 8 million new jobs. And today you know what is referred to as the employment pool is everyone in the United States male and female between the age of 16 and 65 are known as the potential labor pool that if all of them sought work they are all employable. The highest percentage of that labor pool is employed now than has ever been employed before in our history. And the growth in the recovery has been the greatest that we have known in any recovery from any previous recession or depression. But even more than that, there is something out there you get out on the road and talk to the people. There is a spirit. Our young people, who once were, as you know, totally disillusioned with government and so forth over the Vietnam war the resurgence of patriotism among them. And now with our volunteer military no longer having to have a draft I do not know of anything I am more proud of than our young men and women in uniform and their spirit. I ask you a question for the women viewers in our audience. You have just gone through a very critical medical problem, and we know how close you and your wife Nancy are. It is almost a fabled love affair better than Hollywood could do it. What was her reaction? How did she handle this crisis? Well, she is very courageous, and once upon a time when she was younger she was one of those what did they call them those nurses aides that-during war time and all. So, that part, she was on the Job. But she also is a very great worrier, and let me put it this way: I have recovered quicker than she did. It was a terrible crisis. This is the second one. Some of your very close friends from California have gone back into private enterprise or gone back home. Are you turning more to your wife for counsel? She is a very wise lady. Oh, listen, we have always talked over everything together. I could not imagine it being otherwise. But as to the people leaving the administration, I have expected that. I had 8 years experience in California. And I made it plain from the beginning that these people I would take them even if it was only for a year or 2 years and then find someone else if and when they had to return to their own careers. And I think it should be that way if you are going to get well, I always put it this way. I wanted people in government that really did not want a job in government, but that were willing to come and serve rather than those that were seeking government jobs. And the result is, you know that they will have to go back to their own careers sooner or later. But, no, Nancy and I we do not have any secrets from each other. We were very heartened to learn that Reverend Weir had been released from Lebanon, and word reached us that a member of the White House staff was dispatched on Sunday, I believe, to Iran to seek the release of the remaining six and actually it was seven at that time. Is there any word on that that might give hope to us? Well, I cannot really talk about what we are doing, because I do not want to do anything that will endanger the prospects of the others being freed. I can only say that we have explored every avenue. We have been working for this for all the time since the first one, Mr. Buckley, was kidnaped. And I know that some of the families have grown impatient, because if they do not see things in the paper, they do not think we are doing anything. But going public and being in the paper is not the way to get a Reverend Weir back or any of the others. Could we say cautiously optimistic, or is there anything that we can say to characterize it? I have to remain cautiously optimistic. And we are continuing the efforts that and we have explored and been trying in every avenue that is open to us. But, again, it is something I cannot talk about because, as I say, there is a risk in all of this for them. You are getting ready for the summit. Is the American press and a free press is so important in our nation but is it from time to time being manipulated by the Soviet Union to sort of stack the deck against you in this summit meeting? Well, I did begin to feel there for a while that when the summit started they'd be rooting for the other side; that he was wearing the white hat, and I was wearing the black hat. You know, that is an old Hollywood expression, that you identify the villain as I know. by the color of the hat. I think what should be better understood by our people and this is not any criticism of our press the Soviet Union has a worldwide disinformation network, and it is very effective. And they can get many things published and broadcast and so forth to suit their ends and in their drives, for example, to try to create some friction among us and our allies. And I do not think we have anything comparable to that. One last question. I see that our time has run out. If the Congress gives you a trade protectionist bill having either a tariff or a surcharge or some other name, will you veto it? I will have to. That is one of the advantages of being my age. I was looking for work in the Great Depression, and I know what the Smoot-Hawley bill did, the world trade war that it created. There is no way that that can win protectionism for, say, a particular industry no one ever looks over their shoulder to see how many people in other industries lost their jobs-because it is a two-way street, and retaliation sets in. We are still the greatest exporter in the world. And even though there is a great trade imbalance right now, that we are importing far more than we are exporting, that is not because we have reduced our exports, as big as they ever were. We have increased our imports because of the value of our dollar and the fact that our trading partners have not had the economic recovery we have had, so their prices are low. And you cannot blame people for picking up a bargain. What they need is a dose of Reaganomics in Europe, is that what you say? Exactly. As a matter of fact, they themselves admit that in their systems there are so many rigidities in labor laws and everything else that have been built in that they have not had the recovery. Indeed, when I was at the recent economic summit, the last summit in May, they called to my face, they called what we have is the miracle of America. So, we have tried to pass on to them information that we think would help them have some miracles. ENTITY, thank you so much. This has been wonderful. Well ENTITY God bless you. Well, thank you very much, and, in saying that, let me tell you, when you asked about the future and why I was optimistic and all, I am convinced this is a nation under God and as long as we recognize that, believe that, I think he will help us. There is no question about it. That is the greatest cause for optimism I know of. Thank you very much, sir.

{"id": 51, "text": "ENTITY, thank you for this opportunity, we really appreciate it. Thank you so much. Sir, you just met with your personal envoy to the Middle East, Senator Mitchell. Obviously, his first task is to consolidate the cease-fire. But beyond that you have been saying that you want to pursue actively and aggressively peacemaking between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Tell us a little bit about how do you see your personal role, because, you know, if the President of the United States is not involved, nothing happens - as the history of peacemaking shows. Will you be proposing ideas, pitching proposals, parameters, as one of your predecessors did? Or just urging the parties to come up with their own resolutions, as your immediate predecessor did? Well, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals. And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating - in the past on some of these issues - and we do not always know all the factors that are involved. So let us listen. He is going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response. Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what is best for them. They are going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it is time to return to the negotiating table. And it is going to be difficult, it is going to take time. I do not want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I am absolutely confident that the United States - working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region - I am absolutely certain that we can make significant progress. You have been saying essentially that we should not look at these issues - like the Palestinian-Israeli track and separation from the border region - you have been talking about a kind of holistic approach to the region. Are we expecting a different paradigm in the sense that in the past one of the critiques - at least from the Arab side, the Muslim side - is that everything the Americans always tested with the Israelis, if it works. Now there is an Arab peace plan, there is a regional aspect to it. And you have indicated that. Would there be any shift, a paradigm shift? Well, here is what I think is important. Look at the proposal that was put forth by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia - Right. I might not agree with every aspect of the proposal, but it took great courage - Absolutely. - to put forward something that is as significant as that. I think that there are ideas across the region of how we might pursue peace. I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what is happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan. These things are interrelated. And what I have said, and I think Hillary Clinton has expressed this in her confirmation, is that if we are looking at the region as a whole and communicating a message to the Arab world and the Muslim world, that we are ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest, then I think that we can make significant progress. Now, Israel is a strong ally of the United States. They will not stop being a strong ally of the United States. And I will continue to believe that Israel's security is paramount. But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognize that it is important to achieve peace. They will be willing to make sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious partnership on the other side. And so what we want to do is to listen, set aside some of the preconceptions that have existed and have built up over the last several years. And I think if we do that, then there is a possibility at least of achieving some breakthroughs. I want to ask you about the broader Muslim world, but let me - one final thing about the Palestinian-Israeli theater. There are many Palestinians and Israelis who are very frustrated now with the current conditions and they are losing hope, they are disillusioned, and they believe that time is running out on the two-state solution because - mainly because of the settlement activities in Palestinian-occupied territories. Will it still be possible to see a Palestinian state - and you know the contours of it - within the first Obama administration? I think it is possible for us to see a Palestinian state - I am not going to put a time frame on it - that is contiguous, that allows freedom of movement for its people, that allows for trade with other countries, that allows the creation of businesses and commerce so that people have a better life. And, look, I think anybody who has studied the region recognizes that the situation for the ordinary Palestinian in many cases has not improved. And the bottom line in all these talks and all these conversations is, is a child in the Palestinian Territories going to be better off? Do they have a future for themselves? And is the child in Israel going to feel confident about his or her safety and security? And if we can keep our focus on making their lives better and look forward, and not simply think about all the conflicts and tragedies of the past, then I think that we have an opportunity to make real progress. But it is not going to be easy, and that is why we have got George Mitchell going there. This is somebody with extraordinary patience as well as extraordinary skill, and that is what is going to be necessary. Absolutely. Let me take a broader look at the whole region. You are planning to address the Muslim world in your first 100 days from a Muslim capital. And everybody is speculating about the capital. If you have anything further, that would be great. How concerned are you - because, let me tell you, honestly, when I see certain things about America - in some parts, I do not want to exaggerate - there is a demonization of America. Absolutely. It is become like a new religion, and like a new religion it has new converts - like a new religion has its own high priests. Right. It is only a religious text. Right. And in the last - since 9/11 and because of Iraq, that alienation is wider between the Americans and - and in generations past, the United States was held high. It was the only Western power with no colonial legacy. Right. How concerned are you and - because people sense that you have a different political discourse. And I think, judging by and Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden and all these, you know - a chorus - Yes, I noticed this. They seem nervous. They seem very nervous, exactly. Now, tell me why they should be more nervous? Well, I think that when you look at the rhetoric that they have been using against me before I even took office - I know, I know. - what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt. There is no actions that they have taken that say a child in the Muslim world is getting a better education because of them, or has better health care because of them. In my inauguration speech, I spoke about: You will be judged on what you have built, not what you have destroyed. And what they have been doing is destroying things. And over time, I think the Muslim world has recognized that that path is leading no place, except more death and destruction. Now, my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well-being of the Muslim world, that the language we use has to be a language of respect. I have Muslim members of my family. I have lived in Muslim countries. The largest one. The largest one, Indonesia. And so what I want to communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world, what I have come to understand is that regardless of your faith - and America is a country of Muslims, Jews, Christians, non-believers - regardless of your faith, people all have certain common hopes and common dreams. And my job is to communicate to the American people that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives. My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there is no reason why we cannot restore that. And that I think is going to be an important task. But ultimately, people are going to judge me not by my words but by my actions and my administration's actions. And I think that what you will see over the next several years is that I am not going to agree with everything that some Muslim leader may say, or what is on a television station in the Arab world - but I think that what you will see is somebody who is listening, who is respectful, and who is trying to promote the interests not just of the United States, but also ordinary people who right now are suffering from poverty and a lack of opportunity. I want to make sure that I am speaking to them, as well. Tell me, time is running out, any decision on from where you will be visiting the Muslim world? Well, I am not going to break the news right here. Afghanistan? But maybe next time. But it is something that is going to be important. I want people to recognize, though, that we are going to be making a series of initiatives. Sending George Mitchell to the Middle East is fulfilling my campaign promise that we are not going to wait until the end of my administration to deal with Palestinian and Israeli peace, we are going to start now. It may take a long time to do, but we are going to do it now. We are going to follow through on our commitment for me to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital. We are going to follow through on many of my commitments to do a more effective job of reaching out, listening, as well as speaking to the Muslim world. And you are going to see me following through with dealing with a drawdown of troops in Iraq, so that Iraqis can start taking more responsibility. And finally, I think you have already seen a commitment, in terms of closing Guantanamo, and making clear that even as we are decisive in going after terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, that we are going to do so on our terms, and we are going to do so respecting the rule of law that I think makes America great. President Bush framed the war on terror conceptually in a way that was very broad, war on terror, and used sometimes certain terminology that the many people - Islamic fascism. You have always framed it in a different way, specifically against one group called al Qaeda and their collaborators. And is this one way of - I think that you are making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations - whether Muslim or any other faith in the past - that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. And so you will I think see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al Qaeda - that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it - and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians and we will hunt them down. But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship. Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how far are you going in the direction of preventing it? You know, I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran. Now, the Iranian people are a great people, and Persian civilization is a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that is not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region: their threats against Israel; their pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off an arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of terrorist organizations in the past - none of these things have been helpful. But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there are potential avenues for progress. And we will over the next several months be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said during my inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us. Sir, I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

Let us talk about the importance of November 7th, specifically towards the Latino population of the United States. Why should people who, many times, do not feel part of this country, yet are citizens, why should they vote? Because there are issues at stake that will directly affect themselves, their families, their communities, and our country. There are huge differences in the economic policies of the two candidates. Obviously, I favor the ones that Vice President Gore and my wife and others have articulated, but there is the question of whether you think it is better to pay down the debt, have a smaller tax cut focused on the middle class, and invest more in education, or whether it is better to have a bigger tax cut, partially privatized Social Security, and have spending that will take us back in debt but give some people more money right now. That will affect everybody. How do you build on the prosperity of the new of the last 8 years? Then, there are differences of opinion on crime, on the environment, on health care, on education, and on fairness toward immigrants, which should be a big issue to the Latino population. I and virtually everyone in my party are fighting for the Fairness to Immigrants Act, and the leadership of the Republican Party is opposing us. And so we are and we have a simple position, which is that it was right to let people from Cuba and Nicaragua come into this country if they were fleeing dictatorial or violent environments, but we owe the same thing to the people from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, and other places. So I think that is a big issue. Then there are issues revolving around whether we should have hate crimes legislation. Should we have stronger laws guaranteeing equal pay for women? All these things will drastically affect, one way or the other, what life is like for ordinary Americans. Why do you think, sir, that the polls show that candidates really have not gotten through to all of the voters, that there is some apathy, and there is some feeling that, You know what, I do not even want to get involved with this? I think the main anybody that does not want to get involved, I think it is because the issues are not as clear as they should be. But I also think, in a funny way, the general prosperity and sense of well-being of the country could be working against us a little bit. Because people may think, well, you know younger voters, a lot of them cannot even remember what it was like 8 years ago. And I think sometimes when times are good, you tend to be more casual about voting and about studying the differences. And then, maybe they people, I think, do have a negative reaction sometimes to all this the air wars, not just the Presidential race but all these ads where they are attacking each other and all that. That sometimes tends to depress turnout. But I would hope the American people would actually be in a very good humor. I mean, this has been an essentially positive election. The candidates have been sharply critical of each other on the issues, but there has been surprisingly little personal attack. Governor Bush has, I think, wrongly questioned Vice President Gore's character a couple of times, but by and large, both of them have run clean, positive campaigns in which they have strongly disagreed with each other on the issues. But that is what democracy is about. I would think I think the American people ought to be happy. I mean, the economy is growing; all sectors of the society are benefiting. Crime is down. The environment is cleaner. There are fewer people without health insurance. The schools are getting better. I think that people should think, Wow, we have got a chance now to really dream big dreams about what we want America to look like over the next 10 years. What should America's role in the world be over the next 10 years? What is exactly the right thing to do with our projected surplus? And how should we handle all this? This is, for a citizen who loves democracy, a dream election. We may never have another election like this in our lifetime, where we have got prosperity, social progress, and the absence of crisis at home and threat abroad. I would just say to the American people, you make a lot of mistakes in life. Sometimes when things are so good, you think it does not matter if you concentrate or act. It does matter. You know, what does surprise me, sir, is that a ENTITY with a huge popularity as you do, whose numbers continue to be record-setting as far as anybody is concerned, and yet we do not see you in the battleground States. I do not see you in Michigan. I have not seen you in Florida. I have not seen you in Tennessee and even in your home State that much. It surprises me as a journalist. Does it surprise you? Why are not you there? Not exactly. I think, first of all, there is a limit to what the ENTITY can do in another person's race. I have been out a lot this year. I could not go out I think it would have been actually a negative factor if I had gone out before the Congress went home, because people would think, What is ENTITY doing trying to tell me how to vote for the next President when he is got a job to do back in Washington? Now, when they did go home, I went to California. I spent the day in New York trying to help my wife and our candidates here. And I am going to spend a day in Arkansas tomorrow, which is a State where I think we are a little bit behind but not too badly, and maybe I can have an impact there. But I also have done, over the course of this last year, I have been in all those battleground States. I have done 150-plus events for our Congressmen and Senators, every one of them also making the argument for the Vice President. And I cut a lot of radio spots and done some other communications, phone messages, and other things to try to reach swing voters and try to affect the turnout. But I am not so sure, if I had been to more places, it would have made a difference in the vote, because I actually have experienced it from the other end. When President Reagan was wildly popular in 1984, he came to Arkansas and campaigned for my opponent. It had no effect on my vote, not at all. So I have done everything I could do to help the Vice President and Senator Lieberman. And I think that there was a decision made that the best I could do would be to try to articulate a national message, which I can do anywhere yesterday my speech in California was played live on CNN, for example and keep the schedule I had set, because I have a unique relationship with Arkansas, and then try to do direct voter contact. But I want the focus to be on Vice President Gore and Governor Bush. I think the people have to make that decision. All I can do is to help clarify what I think the choice is. You know, the American people have been very good to me, and I have tried to tell them in the last 2 weeks what I think the choice is, and I hope I have had a positive impact. What would you tell them about these last 8 years for you as a less as and more as ENTITY, the man whose dreams, in many ways, came true, and who has had ups and downs? Well, first of all, I feel an enormous sense of gratitude to the American people. I mean, they gave me a chance to serve, and they sort of took a chance on me at first, because I was the Governor of a small State. I was quite young. I had never served an elected office in Washington. But I had some clear ideas about what I thought we should do. So I feel gratitude. Secondly, I feel gratitude because they have worked out pretty well. And one of the lessons that I have learned from all this is that it really matters if you want to run for ENTITY, you should have reasons for running that are bigger than yourself, bigger than your desire to do it, because that will sustain you in the tough times. It gives you a game plan. It gives you a way of organizing a team and marshaling the energy of the country. And of course, the people stayed with me in the tough times, too. So when I leave office, I will leave grateful for the progress America has made, grateful for the generosity and support of the American people, but I will also be more idealistic than I was the day I took the oath of office. In spite of all the battles I have been through, I am more idealistic about the potential of America within our country and the potential of America to have a positive impact around the world than I was when I took office. How do you plan to channel that optimism and continue trying to make a difference? I hope that what I can do is to try to trade my job in, which now has an enormous amount of power and authority, but requires me to be involved in literally hundreds of things, and identify four or five big areas that I care passionately about and concentrate my energies there, so that whatever influence I have as a former ENTITY, being able to concentrate in fewer areas, I will still have a positive impact. I am still working on the details of how to do that, but I really hope I can do that. I think that I have an obligation to my country and to the people who have been my friends and allies around the world to try to use whatever time and energy I have left in this astonishing, unique experience I have had to make the world a better place, and I will keep trying. Give me an idea, something that may or may not work out, but something that we could be seeing you at. Well, I am very interested in the economic empowerment of poor people. That is something I have worked on here at home with our empowerment zone programs, with our community development institutions, making loans to people who could not get them otherwise, and something that my wife and I have worked on around the world. Last year, through our AID programs, we made 2 million small microenterprise loans in Latin America and Africa and in poorer countries in Asia. I think one of the problems with democracy is, it is hard for it to take root if people do not feel any tangible benefits. In Latin America today, we have some countries where democracy is more fragile partly because they have not felt the benefits. One of the problems we have in the Middle East today, with all the tension in the West Bank and Gaza, is that many Palestinians are not better off today economically than they were when we signed the peace agreement way back in 1993. And we have to do a better job in the world of merging politics and economics. So that is one area that I am very interested in. We will talk about the Middle East real quick before we go to Latin America, which is a subject dear to our viewers' hearts. Some critics have said that the United States, your administration, has been so keen on pushing for some kind of concessions on both sides, that maybe it is become an American agenda in the Middle East, versus the Americans acting as brokers and as objective people who can help the system. I do not think that is a fair criticism. Here is why. We, all along, have basically facilitated what the parties wanted to do. Now, when we met at Camp David, we met knowing that there might not be an agreement. But we did it because both parties were afraid that they were coming up on the September deadline for the declaration of a Palestinian state without an agreement, and that without further progress on these tough issues, we might have a real mess there, even worse than what we have been through. So what I tried to do was to explore when they reach an impasse, I did what President Carter did, way back at Camp David I, between Israel and Egypt. If they reach an impasse, then you can offer an idea to see if both sides will take it. But it can never be America's agenda. All we can ever do is try to be an honest and fair broker, because we do not have to live with the consequences. The people that have to live with the consequences are the Israelis and the Palestinians. So for us to try to force something on them is a grave mistake. On the other hand, the consequences of not making peace have been evident these last 3 or 4 weeks over there, and they are just horrible. So we should nudge them when we can, and as long as both sides trust us, we can nudge them without them thinking it is our agenda, because they know when they have to get off they know when they cannot do something. This January will mark the 42d anniversary of Castro in power, the longest lasting dictator. Why have not you helped the internal dissident movement in Cuba like, let us say, Reagan did for Poland? Well, I do not know what else we could have done. I believe I could have done a lot more if the Cuban Democracy Act had been left intact. And the Cuban community in Florida, for example, and in New Jersey, strongly supported the Cuban Democracy Act. I think we could have done a lot more for the dissident movement in Cuba, because we would have been in a position to have carrots and sticks in return for openness and change, and we could have supported them. But when Castro's air force murdered those Brothers to the Rescue people in the two airplanes, shot them down completely illegally, we had to have some sort of response. The Congress passed the Helms-Burton bill. I signed it, but it tied the hands of the executives so much that it is hard for us to use the full panoply of pressures we had. For example, let us just take Kosovo I mean Serbia. We just had an election in Serbia, Mr. Kostunica. We could put a lot of money into a democratic election there, but we also had something to offer them if they won. I had the power to immediately suspend the embargo, to do other things. We had an embargo on them that was very tough, but I always had the flexibility to use carrots and sticks. I think it is a great mistake, and I hope the next Congress will correct it to put the ENTITY in a position where he can promote positive change in Cuba. Because the Congress believes the only way it can show it is anti-Castro is to make sure that the ENTITY has no leverage. The Congress just adopted another bill that I think was a mistake. They put it in the Agriculture bill, and I had no choice but to sign it. The bill purported to sell allow more food sales to Cuba, but because it does not have any financing mechanism, there will not be any food sales. The real purpose of the bill was to further restrict the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba and have person-to-person contact. I think that is a mistake, because I think it again we have no plans to invade Cuba. If there is not going to be a military invasion of Cuba, then what you need is a balance of carrots and sticks. I am disappointed that Castro is still in power. I am disappointed that democracy has not been restored to Cuba. I am glad that we have had a very tough line these last 8 years. I wish we could have done better. But I think that it is a mistake I think the Cuban Democracy Act was right. That was the right concept: more sticks and more carrots, more flexibility. Get in there and find the people in Cuba that are promoting democracy, that are promoting free markets, that are promoting freedom of speech, that are politically opposed to the communist regime, and find ways to support them. And find ways to give power to just ordinary people doing all kinds of things that are inconsistent with a total communist dictatorship. And I hope that we will he cannot last forever. Nobody lives forever, for one thing. And I do not think that the system is sustainable without him, but I would like to see change before then. I know even in Miami and in New Jersey, I hear more and more discussion among my friends in the Cuban communities about what else we could do. I wish we could have done better. I do think the next ENTITY should be given more tools. If we want to try to move toward freedom quicker, we have got to give the ENTITY more tools to deal with. One of the good stories coming out of Latin America is this election in Mexico with Vicente Fox winning the PRI after 70something years. Great story. Tell me how that is the influence you think or the impact of that story on not only on the United States-Mexico relations but also on Latin America in general. Well, first of all, I think it is a great credit to the people of Mexico that they had an honest election, that it was carried off in a forthright way. It is secondly a great credit to Ernesto Zedillo, because he, first of all, opened his own party's Presidential nomination up to a broader popular choice, and secondly, he basically assured an honest election to make politics competitive in Mexico. So I think ENTITY Zedillo will go down in history for many things in a positive way. He had a very good economic policy, but he also had the courage to give up his own party's monopoly of power. And he knew what he was doing when he opened the system. Then thirdly, I think it is a tribute to Mr. Fox. He is a very engaging, compelling man. He is an interesting man. He is a Charismatic. Very charismatic. He lives on a ranch. He showed me the boots he was wearing he said were made in a boot factory on his own ranch. His children still, by and large, live on the ranch; I think one of them lives in Mexico City now. He is a very impressive man. And what I hope will happen is that when he takes office, I hope that the PRI will try to cooperate with him, will try to work with him, will give him a chance to succeed. Because one of the problems that a new ENTITY faces, if your party has never been in power or if your party has been out of power a very long time that even happens here sometimes; we faced some of those challenges when I came in is, you have to put together a team that not only is smart and knowledgeable on policy but also can figure out how to work through the political culture of a country, in this case Mexico's political culture, which has never before had a ENTITY of another party. So I would hope that since Mexico has oneterm Presidencies, the PRI has nothing to lose by helping Mr. Fox succeed and giving him a chance to do good for Mexico. If he makes a mistake, he will have to live with the consequences, like we all do. But I think that America has a big interest in the success of Mexico, and I think the PRI will rise in the esteem of the public if they are seen to be a constructive force there. So this will be an interesting test for them because they have never been like this before, either. I like Mexico's chances for the future. I think their I personally believe their biggest problem is the same thing Colombia is facing, but on a smaller scale. The narcotraffickers have so much loose money to throw around in countries that are poor, and have so much power to throw around in communities and areas where the power structure is weak, that that is a real test for Mexico and its democracy. But it is basically, I think, Mexico is moving in the right direction and deserves a lot of the world's applause for what is happened there. In interviews with Esta Man ana, both Governor Bush and Vice ENTITY Gore have said that a lot needs to be done as far as how INS handles the Mexicans who try to reach this country for a better life for themselves and for their family. They both have said that they failed to there is not enough, maybe, human respect towards families that are divided, people who are sent back without any kind of sensitivity towards their cases. Would you agree with that? Oh, yes. I think there are several problems with the INS. But I think, first, there is the whole issue of how we deal with controlling our borders and immigrants that come here without legal sanction. And then there is the question of how we handle those who are eligible for naturalization and how long they have to wait and how they are treated while they are waiting. The Vice ENTITY headed up a task force for us back in '96 to try to dramatically speed the naturalization process, and we did you remember we did a project in Miami and in several other cities. We got an enormous amount of criticism from the Congress, I think, because they thought that immigrants would be more likely to be Democratic voters. Although one of the reasons we did it in Miami was because, as you know, Cuban-American voters normally tend to vote for Republicans for ENTITY, and we wanted to demonstrate that we were not trying to be partisan. What we wanted to do was to make the INS work better for people who were eligible for naturalization. Now, for people who are trying to get in the country, it is a genuine dilemma, because every nation has to have some control over its borders and some limits on immigration. And if you ignore those entirely, with regard to Mexico, because of our long history and the culture of the Rio Grande Valley and all of that you know very well, then you are sort of really hurting those people that wait their turn in line. So I think what we need is a little better treatment. We need to review the quota. We need to make sure that people are treated right, and then we need to examine whether or not we need to do more on the family unification front. As you know, that is one of things we are fighting for in the Latino immigrant fairness legislation before Congress now, is trying to do a little more on family reunification, because it seems to me that America ought to be a pro-family country. We ought to let people be together. And that is another reason I am fighting for the Liberians, too. You may be familiar with that case and the Liberian immigrants. I will say this: I think, on balance, the Government works a lot better than it did when I got here, but I am disappointed that I have not made more improvements in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. So both Governor Bush and the Vice ENTITY are right, and I am glad that they have both committed to focus on it. My last question is, here is a kid who goes to the White House and meets ENTITY Kennedy, then later as a grown man is saying hello to kids on that same lawn. Here is a political animal who has studied all his life politics, history. I see you out there on the line, and you seem to be the last guy who wants to be there. The people who have shook your hand leave before you do, because you want to say hello and touch everybody out there. How in the heck are you going to do what are you going to do after this? Here is a guy who you are a young guy, and all your life you have done this, and I see you out there. Now what? What happens? I do love politics, and I also love public service. I will miss the job of being ENTITY even more than the political events, even more than living in the White House, which has been a profound honor. But you know, it is our system, and it is probably a pretty good system, that a person just gets to be ENTITY for 8 years, if you are lucky. So I have to do what I have done before at several points in my life. I have to start a new life and figure out how to use the life I have lived to good effect in building a new life. And I will not have to stop being a citizen of America or a citizen of the world; I just will not be the candidate any more. I hope I will be a member of the Senate spouses club after Tuesday. I told Vice ENTITY Gore that if he got elected, I would do whatever he wanted me to do, anything from coming in to talk or going to funerals. I'd do whatever I was asked to do. I have done this. I am grateful. I am not going to stop being an interested citizen, but I have to make a new life. I just hope it will be one that will be of some use to my country. ENTITY, thank you very much. I appreciate you being with us on Esta Man ana.

{"id": 1002, "text": "My fellow Americans: This is a very special time of year for us, a time for family reunions and for celebrating together the blessings of God and the promises He has given us. From Thanksgiving to Hanukkah, which our Jewish community is now celebrating, to Christmas in 3 weeks' time, this is a season of hope and of love. Certainly one of the greatest blessings for people everywhere is the family itself. The American Family Institute recently dedicated its book of essays, The Family in the Modern World, to Maria Victoria Walesa, daughter of Danuta and Lech Walesa, to whose christening came 7,000 Poles expressing their belief that the family remains the foundation of freedom. And, of course, they are right. It is in the family where we learn to think for ourselves, care for others, and acquire the values of self-reliance, integrity, responsibility, and compassion. Families stand at the center of society, so building our future must begin by preserving family values. Tragically, too many in Washington has been asking us to swallow a whopper: namely, that bigger government is the greatest force for fairness and progress. But this so-called solution has given most of us a bad case of financial indigestion. How can families survive when big government's powers to tax, inflate, and regulate absorb their wealth, usurp their rights, and crush their spirit? Was there compassion for a working family in 21 1/2- percent interest rates, 12 1/2-percent inflation, and taxes soaring out of sight? Consider the cost of childrearing. It now takes $85,000 to raise a child to age 18, and family incomes have not kept up. During the 1970's real wages actually declined over 2 percent. Consider taxes. In 1948 the tax on the average two-child family was just $9. Today it is $2,900. As economic and social pressures have increased, the bonds that bind families together have come under strain. For example, three times as many families are headed by single parents today as in 1960. Many single parents make heroic sacrifices and deserve all our support. But there is no question that many well-intentioned Great Society-type programs contributed to family breakups, welfare dependency, and a large increase in births out of wedlock. In the 1970's the number of single mothers rose from 8 to 13 percent among whites and from 31 to a tragic 47 percent among blacks. Too often their children grow up poor, malnourished, and lacking in motivation. It is a path to social and health problems, low school performance, unemployment, and delinquency. If we strengthen families, we will help reduce poverty and the whole range of other social problems. We can begin by reducing the economic burdens of inflation and taxes, and we are doing this. Since 1980 inflation has been chopped by three-fourths. Taxes have been cut for every family that earns a living, and we have increased the tax credit for child care. Yesterday we learned that our growing economy reduced unemployment to 8.2 percent last month. The payroll employment figure went up by 370,000 jobs. At the same time, new policies are helping our neediest families move from dependence to independence. Our new job training law will train over a million needy and unemployed Americans each year for productive jobs. ENTITY should add that our enterprise zones proposal would stimulate new businesses, bringing jobs and hope to some of the most destitute areas of the country. The Senate has adopted this proposal. But after 2 years of delay, the House Democratic leadership only recently agreed to hold its first hearing on the legislation. This is a jobs bill America needs. And come January, we expect action. We are moving forward on many other fronts. We have made prevention of drug abuse among youth a top priority. We will soon announce a national missing children's center to help find and rescue children who've been abducted and exploited. We are working with States and local communities to increase the adoption of special-needs children. More children with permanent homes mean fewer children with permanent problems. We are also stiffening the enforcement of child support from absent parents. And we are trying hard to improve education through more discipline, a return to the basics, and through reforms like tuition tax credits to help hard-working parents. In coming months, we will propose new ways to help families stay together, remain independent, and cope with the pressures of modern life. A cornerstone of our efforts must be assisting families to support themselves. As Franklin Roosevelt said almost 50 years ago, Self-help and self-control are the essence of the American tradition. In Washington everyone looks out for special interest groups. Well, i think families are pretty special. And with your help, we will continue looking out for their interests. Till next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationtheamericanfamily", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on the American Family", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-the-american-family", "publication_date": "03-12-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 622, "text": "Happy New Year, everybody. This week, I traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, to talk with folks about the biggest challenge we face as a country: rebuilding our economy so that, once again, hard work pays off, responsibility is rewarded, and anyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from, can make it if they try. That is the economy America deserves. That is the economy I am fighting every day to build. Now, to get there, the most important thing we need to do is to get more Americans back to work. And over the past 3 years, we have made steady progress. We just learned that our economy added 212,000 private sector jobs in December. After losing more than 8 million jobs in the recession, we have added more than 3 million private sector jobs over the past 22 months. And we are starting 2012 with manufacturing on the rise and the American auto industry on the mend. We are heading in the right direction, and we are not going to let up. On Wednesday, the White House will host a forum called Insourcing American Jobs. We will hear from business leaders who are bringing jobs back home and see how we can help other businesses follow their lead. Because this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and all those working to get there. We have got to keep at it. We have got to keep creating jobs. And we have got to keep rebuilding our economy so that everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. We cannot go back to the days when the financial system was stacking the deck against ordinary Americans. To me, that is not an option, not after all we have been through. That is why I appointed Richard Cordray as our Nation's new consumer watchdog this week. Richard's job is simple: to look out for you. Every day, his sole mission is to protect consumers from potential abuses by the financial industry and to make sure that you have got all the transparent information you need to make the important financial decisions in your lives. I nominated Richard for this job last summer. And yet Republicans in the Senate kept blocking his confirmation, not because they objected to him, but because they wanted to weaken his agency. That made no sense. Every day we waited was a day you and consumers all across the country were at greater financial risk. So this year, I am going to keep doing whatever it takes to move this economy forward and to make sure that middle class families regain the security they have lost over the past decade. That is my New Year's resolution to all of you. Thanks, and have a great weekend.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsweeklyaddress8", "title": "Barack Obama The President's Weekly Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-weekly-address-8", "publication_date": "07-01-2012", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 986, "text": "Thank you all very much. Governor, thank you very much. It is a great honor to be back in Ohio. Today I come bringing a special visitor, un amigo de mio y tambien un amigo de los Estados Unidos. It is an honor to bring a good friend of mine and a friend of our country, President Vicente Fox, to Ohio. I have the honor of introducing him. But before I do so, I wanted to introduce him to Ohio. Ohio is an extraordinary State. It is a State full of decent and compassionate and hard-working people-Toledo. Not all the wisdom exists in Washington, DC. There is a lot of wisdom in towns like Toledo, Ohio. And it was my honor that the President had accepted not only the invitation for the first state dinner I had as your President but agreed to travel with me to the heartland. So I want to thank you all for a warm welcome. I want to thank so very much the leadership of the University of Toledo and the students who are here, the faculty that have made this event possible. Thank you for your hospitality. Mr. Mayor, thank you for your hospitality as well. It is a thrill to be traveling with members of the United States congressional delegation, some of whom do what I tell them to do some of whom are a little hard to persuade, but all of whom love America and all of whom bring honor to the office they hold. Thank you all very much for coming with me today. I am very proud to be traveling with one of my Cabinet Secretaries, a man who is doing a fabulous job at HUD. His name is Mel Martinez. When he was a young boy, his mother and daddy put him on a boat-I guess it was an airplane-to come to America from Cuba. They were not ever sure whether they would see him again. They were sure, however, they were sending him to a place that loved freedom, a place where you can be anything you want to be in America. Today, this good man is in the Cabinet. It shows what a wonderful country we have and shows what a great man Mel Martinez is. Thank you for coming, Mel. We have got distinguished members from the Mexican delegation traveling with us. We have got Ambassadors traveling with us. And we have even got the Treasurer of the United States traveling with us. My friend Rosario Marin is now the Treasurer of this great country. Please welcome her and all of the members of the Mexican delegation as well. We just had a really good visit in Washington. It was a commitment to friendship. It is important for my fellow Americans to understand my foreign policy, and it starts with this: Good foreign policy says you want your neighborhood to be peaceful and prosperous; a good foreign policy starts with being friends with your neighbors. We are friends with our neighbors to the North, and we are very good friends with our neighbors to the South, the Mexicanos. Friends hold each other with respect- treat each other with respect and hold each other in high esteem. And the speaker I am going to introduce is a man I hold in high esteem. Friends are willing to have honest dialog. And we have had a series of honest dialogs over the last 24 hours, had a frank discussion, but this is not our first discussion. We have been discussing common opportunities and common problems for months. And as a result, our relationship has never been better and never been stronger. I know there are some in this world and our country who want to build walls between Mexico and the United States. I want to remind people: Fearful people build walls; confident people tear them down. And I am confident that a strong relationship-and I am confident that good neighbors and a strong relationship is in our Nation's best interests. I have seen it firsthand. Trade between Mexico and the United States has grown to a quarter of a trillion dollars. That means jobs in the United States, and as importantly, that means jobs in Mexico. There is a lot of discussion about trade. I cannot tell you how hopeful trade is and how important it is. It is not only important for job-seeking Americans; it is incredibly important for Mexico to grow and to prosper, to develop a middle class for people in Mexico to be able to find work close to home. Oh, I know there is a lot of talk about Mexican laborers coming to the United States. But I want to remind my fellow citizens of this fact: Family values do not stop at the Rio Bravo. There are mothers and dads in Mexico who love their children just as much as mothers and dads in America do. And if there are a mother or dad who cannot find work, worried about food on the table, they are going to come and find work in America. And what we want to do is to have a trading relationship that encourages job creation in America but job creation in Mexico as well. We want Mexico to grow a middle class so the citizens of Mexico can find work to feed their families just like the citizens of America can find work to feed their families. We are talking about migration issues. It is a complex subject, but one that this country of ours must confront and have an open dialog about. And we have made good progress on that important issue. I want to tell you, President Fox is doing everything in his power to fight crime and drugs, and we are cooperating with him. But I also want to remind my fellow Americans, it is important to fight the supply of drugs. But we have an obligation inside this country to fight to reduce the demand for drugs as well. We need to tell our children: Do not use drugs; make the right choices in life. We are working hard on environmental issues on our border. But our fellow citizens must understand that there is more than just economics that is important or crime-fighting that is important in our relationship with Mexico. We share values with Mexico. They are common values, values that unite people, whether they live in the United States or whether they live in Mexico. And what are those values? Faith, the strong value of faith exists in our country. As a matter of fact, I think it is the strength of America in many ways, and it exists in Mexico as well. The love of family-it is incredibly important for the future of our country. It is a strong value in the Mexican culture. The willingness to work hard. America is known for our ability to work hard. Think about the Mexican worker who walks 500 miles across a desert to find work. Those are hard-working citizens. We share that very important value of people willing to roll up their sleeves and work hard. No, we have got incredibly important relationship. It starts with leaders being willing to have open dialog. We have got something in common, by the way, that you probably have not thought about. President Fox's grandfather was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. My grandfather was raised in Columbus, Ohio. I guess you could kind of say we are Ohioans, except it is kind of hard to tell by our accents. Not only do we share background; we share love for our respective countries. The first trip I took to foreign soil was to Guanajuato, Mexico, to visit President Fox on his ranch. By the way, I kind of like going to mine on occasion, too. And this is a man deeply committed to his country. He loves the people of Mexico. And I hope by now there is no question that I love the people of America as well. President Fox and I share the desire to do what we think is right for our countries. I think both of us are tired of the policy driven by polls and focus groups. I do not need a poll and focus group to tell me what to think and where to go, and neither does he. We both are doing in office what we said we would do. I told the people, by the way, that if they gave me the chance to be the President, the first thing I would do is remember whose taxpayers' money we are talking about when we are talking about budgets. The tax money up in Washington, that is not the Government's money; it is the people's money. And I am proud to report we have got the largest tax relief package in a generation. We both are dedicated to educating- to making sure our children are educated. President Fox shares the same passion I do about good schools and good quality education. He knows what I know, that an educated child is one much more likely to be able to realize the dreams of our respective countries. That is why I am hopeful Congress will quit talking about an education bill, get one out of conference committee, so I can sign a good reform package to make sure public education fulfills the promise of our schools. One of the things in Texas we like to say: Here is a good man. I hope that sums up how I feel about our speaker and guest. This guy is a good man, un buen hombre.

{"id": 563, "text": "I have gladly accepted the invitation to say a few words on this program launching the annual Roll Call of the American Red Cross. I join in this appeal because ENTITY of the United States also is ENTITY of the American Red Cross. Moreover, I believe with heart and soul that all of us Americans should do everything we can to support an organization of such vital importance to our people. Knowledge of our individual responsibility toward the national and international services of the Red Cross is always essential to the success of these ministrations of mercy. We should bear in mind that, during the Roll Call, the Red Cross does not ask us to make a mere donation. It invites us to join and to take our place in the legion of men and women of good will who make the Red Cross one of our strongest shields against forces of destruction-whether activated by nature or man. We must realize that regardless of race, creed, or color, the Red Cross deeply matters to us, as individuals, in a world darkened by conflict and misery. The Red Cross stands upon a remarkable record of service to humanity. Founded in 1881 and chartered by Congress in 1905 as our national voluntary relief agency, the American Red Cross has played a conspicuous part in relieving the distress which has followed every national disaster. The growth of its services to the nation has been in direct proportion to the growing confidence of the American people in its ability to respond swiftly and competently to emergency situations. The Red Cross this year is being called upon to meet an unusual number of appeals for aid from every quarter. Because our Red Cross is a member of the large family of Red Cross societies which, in time of war, join with the neutral International Red Cross in Geneva in the alleviation of suffering caused by war, the conflict in Europe has brought added responsibilities to our national organization. We of this fortunate country are already doing much, in the name of humanity, on behalf of the unfortunate victims of this unhappy conflict. I am sure you would not want it otherwise, and when the time comes for the Red Cross to ask your help to continue this work I am confident of your sympathetic response. Equally important, however, is the year-in and year-out battle of our Red Cross to preserve life and health here at home. The psychology of hate and destruction, so rampant today, makes it too easy to forget that while war is not a human necessity, neither are the preventable deaths which harm a nation at peace. It is essential, therefore, that the Red Cross continue its efforts to reduce the number of avoidable accidents and illnesses which yearly take the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. To make this possible we must keep our Red Cross prepared through memberships and contributions to meet any and all emergencies, whether at home or abroad. The annual Roll Call of the American Red Cross begins today, Armistice Day, but there can be no armistice in our war against need and human suffering. We have been told many times that it is our Red Cross, that it is our voluntary agency for the relief and prevention of suffering of our neighbors at home and abroad-and, perhaps, of ourselves. I would like to underscore the truth of that statement. It is our Red Cross, yours and mine. It needs our warmhearted, generous, typically American support. Both as Chief Executive and as a fellow citizen I urge you to join during the Roll Call- to join now, and to do your bit.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioappealfortheredcross", "title": "Radio Appeal for the Red Cross.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-appeal-for-the-red-cross", "publication_date": "11-11-1939", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 676, "text": "Well, I just want to welcome the Amir of Qatar and thank him and the people of his country for the friendship that they have shown towards the United States. There is an excellent relationship between the United States and Qatar on a whole range of levels : with respect to security, with respect to our military cooperation, our commerce and our trade. Qatar has been a center of innovation. We have seen enormous progress within the country on everything ranging from education to health care. And I think His Highness has shown extraordinary leadership over the last many years in helping to guide his country. Obviously, Qatar is also an important country in the region and has an influence that extends beyond its relatively small population. And so we had an opportunity to discuss a whole range of issues that directly relate to U.S. interests and U.S. security, but more importantly, the security of the entire world. We had a conversation about the situation in Syria. And obviously, we have been cooperating closely with Qatar and other countries in seeking to bring about an end to the slaughter that is taking place there-the removal of President Assad, who has shown himself to have no regard for his own people-and to strengthen an opposition that can bring about a democratic Syria that represents all people and respects their rights regardless of their ethnicity or their religious affiliations. And I am very pleased that we are going to be continuing to work in the coming months to try to further support the Syrian opposition, and we will be closely coordinating our strategies to bring about a more peaceful resolution to the Syrian crisis. We also had an opportunity to discuss the situation in Egypt, where we both very much want to see success on the part of Egyptian democracy. And both of our countries are committed to trying to encourage not only progress in this new democracy, but also economic progress that can translate into actual prosperity for the people there. We had an opportunity to discuss the situation with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we both agree that peace is in the interests of everyone: a secure Israel side-by-side with a sovereign Palestinian state. And we exchanged ideas about how we can advance those negotiations, and I have shared the importance of providing support to President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority so that they can be in position to have fruitful negotiations with the Israelis that can bring about, in a timely fashion, a two-state solution. And I had an opportunity to thank the Amir for the strong support that his country has provided to our efforts in Afghanistan, including the efforts that he has personally been involved with in getting a dialogue between the Afghan Government and the Taliban that might potentially result in some sort of political reconciliation. These are all very difficult issues, and neither of us are under any illusions that they will be solved overnight. But what we agree with is that if our two countries are communicating frankly and constructively and pursuing common strategies, that we can be a force for good for the entire region and for a vision of the Middle East that is democratic, that is prosperous, that is tolerant, that is representative of all peoples, and that is a force for good around the world. And so I want to thank the Amir for this visit and for his friendship. And I look forward to working with him and the Government of Qatar for many years to come.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithamirhamadbinkhalifaalthaniqatar0", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Amir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-amir-hamad-bin-khalifa-al-thani-qatar-0", "publication_date": "23-04-2013", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 785, "text": "Thank you very much. I am really glad to see you. I bring you greetings from Hillary and our all-grown-up daughter, who are otherwise occupied in New York today. And she is doing very well, and I am proud of her. I think she is going to win on Tuesday. I want to talk today about today and tomorrow. Nostalgia will have to wait. I do want to thank people that are up here on this stage for their friendship. I thank Mark Pryor for taking on this campaign and for getting involved in public life in our State, carrying on his great family tradition while his daddy becomes an ivy league egghead. You notice, I was the only one who was dumb enough to do that before I ran for office; David waited until afterward. I want to thank Vic Snyder, who has been a great friend and supporter of mine in Congress and a great Representative for this district. It is been my honor to vote for him every time he is been on the ballot. I want to thank James Lee Witt and Rodney Slater. They have represented our State so well in the Cabinet. They have represented our country. They have done superb jobs, and I am very proud of them. We have a few other Arkansans in the crowd. I cannot see everybody because the lights are real bright. But I saw Ken Smith and Jim Bob Baker out there. They have also done very well by our administration and there may be others. But I am really-and Janis Kearney, I think, is here, who-she keeps up with what I do every day, and some day when I want to write my memoirs, I will be able to read what Janis said I did. And so when you read the book, it may be what she said instead of me, because I cannot remember anything anymore. But I want to thank all the people who are here. I want to thank Carroll Willis who has been down here working and who has been at the Democratic Party all these years and has done such a great job. And I want to thank my buddy Dale Bumpers. I finally got over being mad at him for leaving the Senate. You know, Dale and Dave and I could not quite calibrate our respective schedules and biological clocks so we could go out together. But I sort of envision a remake of the Three Amigos movie, where we just get on horses and ride out of Washington and thank hallelujah we survived it all. Look, I want to talk about this election a little bit. Arkansas is close. Polls say we are a couple points behind. The people in this room could carry this State for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, if you want to bad enough. And I just want to say a few things. I appreciate what is been said, but our public life is always about tomorrow. And yet, yesterday is an indicator of tomorrow. As near as I can see, the case that the other guys are making is, Well, the economy is better; crime is down; welfare is down; the environment is better; education is improving; more people than ever are going on to college; we have got a decline in the number of people without health insurance for the first time in 12 years. So what we need to do is bag all those policies and do something entirely different. And among other things, now that we have got this surplus, I am going to give it all back to you right now, and then some. Now, as nearly as I can see, that is the campaign. And I do not think people understand that. Because, as Vic would say, they run these ads on prescription drugs, and I will say more about that and the Patients' Bill of Rights and all that. Why is that? Because they know that they have got a lot at stake in this election. They know there are big differences, and they know that the voters understand what the differences are and what the consequences are, that Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will be elected and the Democrats will win the House and the Senate. Therefore, there has to be a lot of muddying of the water. And it is a lot easier to muddy things up than it is to clarify them. Plus which, I think a lot of people kind of have forgotten what it was like 8 years ago. And sometimes it is harder to make a good decision in good times than it is in bad times. There are younger voters that will be voting in this Presidential election that do not even remember what it was like 8 years ago; even if they tried to think about it, they would have no memory of it. So here is what I would like you to say to people for the next 3 days. The people in this room can carry this State for Al Gore if you want to bad enough. And this State could literally determine the outcome of the election. There are about 15 to 20 States that are literally within 3 points one way or the other. And no one knows what is going to happen, but what will happen is, the people that want it bad enough will win. That is what is going to happen. Now, you know they want it bad enough because they do not like what we have done on issues where the majority of the people agree with us, and you know that they will show up because they have been out a long time. So you have just got to decide whether you think this is worth fighting for; because if you do, we will win. Here is what I would like you to say to people. First of all, the Republicans believe that former President Reagan is the source of all wisdom. He said you should decide whether to continue the party in office based on whether you are better off today than you were 8 years ago. So, by the Reagan test, Al Gore wins. But the real issue is, do you want to continue this prosperity and extend it to people and places that have been left behind? Now look, I want-I have never heard this as clearly explained as I think it needs to be. And the previous speakers talked about it a little bit, but I want you to think about it. People ask me all the time, they come up to me, and every time I go someplace in the country, they say, Oh, Mr. President, you have had such a nice, good 8 years, and you have had such a good economy; what great, new idea that you and Bob Rubin and Lloyd Bentsen bring to economic policy in Washington? And I always answer with one word, Arithmetic. You know, and I'd normally tell them I was from Arkansas and I had to be Governor 12 years, and I always found arithmetic was good-I did not need algebra, calculus, trigonometry-arithmetic. We made the numbers add up. And what getting rid of the deficit did was to drive interest rates down, make it cheaper for people to borrow in the private sector. It ballooned the stock market, increased investment in business. It created over 22 million new jobs. And we did it in a way-this is the most important thing to me-it was good for everybody. Poverty went down; average income went above $40,000 for the first time in the history of the country. We all went forward together. But it starts with arithmetic. Now, you can argue that Governor Bush and Al Gore have different tax plans and which one is better. Most people in Arkansas would be better off under the Gore plan in the short run, because it is more tilted toward middle class working people. But forget about that. Let us just look at the cost. And you can certainly argue about the Social Security plan, about whether it is good or bad to privatize Social Security. Let us forget about that for just a minute. The projected surplus is $2 trillion. That sounds like a lot of money-just say 2. I do not think it will be that big, by the way, because this Congress put a lot of pork-barrel spending in to get themselves reelected, which I do not think they will be successful in doing, and I certainly hope not. But give the Republicans their number, 2. Now, the Republican tax cut costs 1.3, but because you are not paying down the debt as much, it has extra interest costs. That is another 300 billion, so it is really 1.6. Now, they have admitted that their privatization of Social Security plan costs a trillion dollars. And as the Vice President said, you cannot spend the same money twice; you cannot give the same money to young people to put in the stock market and then give it to those of us who are over 50, when our Social Security checks are due. So that is another trillion that has to come out of the surplus. So that is 1.6 and 1. And then they promise to spend some money, about half a trillion dollars-that is .5. Here is the big issue in this election, economically: 1.6 plus 1 plus .5 is 3.1, and 3.1 is bigger than 2. Now, I am telling you, this is not rocket science. You get by all the romance and all the rhetoric, somebody up there has got to have arithmetic. We brought arithmetic back to Washington. The Republicans forgot about arithmetic for 12 years. They quadrupled the debt, and they want to go right back to the same economic policy they had before. And it is higher interest rates, which means trouble for all of you. Do you know, the average-the first-people in America who are paying on a $100,000 mortgage today are saving $2,000 every single year in lower interest rates because we got rid of the deficit. It is estimated that Al Gore's plan will keep interest rates one percent lower for a decade. Why? Because he pays off the debt. Now, you know what that is worth? Three hundred and ninety billion dollars in lower home mortgages, $30 billion in lower car payments, $15 billion in lower college loan payments, lower credit card payments; lower business loans, which means more businesses, more jobs, higher income and a bigger stock market. That is how the rich get richer, and the rest of us do, too. Arithmetic. Now, I am telling you, you cannot go back to deficits without having higher interest rates and hurting ordinary people and weakening the overall economy. So you have just got to tell people this. You cannot -you know, things are going along so well, they say, it is your money-which of course it is, the whole deal is yours. That is what the election is about. So things are going along so well, they say, let us just take it all now. And here is the Vice President, that they criticize for telling people what they want to hear, and he said, Uh-uh, we are going to first pay down the debt. Then we are going to take what is left, and we are going to invest in education, health care, and the environment and give the American people a tax cut we can afford, for child care, long-term care, the cost of college tuition, and retirement savings. That is what we are going to do. But why are intelligent and very wealthy people like Bob Rubin still for Al Gore? Because they know they are better off with lower interest rates and working people having jobs and consuming and keeping this economy going. Now, you can explain that to people. Anybody can understand that. You cannot have a tax cut this big, a Social Security privatization program this big, and promise to spend this kind of money when there is not that much money. And the Gore/Lieberman plan is to pay down the debt, invest in the education of our children, in health care, in the environment, in national security, the things we have to have, and give the people a tax cut we can afford. We will all be better off. And you have just got to ask people, Do you remember where we were 8 years ago? Do you want to build on this prosperity and extend it to others, or do you want to reverse it and go back to the previous economic program? It is not like we do not have a test here. We tried it our way for 8 years; before that, we tried it their way for 12 years. Our way works better. Vote for Gore. You can say that, and people will understand what you are saying. The second thing I want to say is, this country is not just better off. This is a better, stronger, more united country. And I think it is worth pointing out that there were specific, serious policies of this administration that contributed to that. The crime rate is at a 26-year low. Why? Because we have got 100,000 police on the street; we are putting another 50,000 on the street. The Brady bill kept guns out of a half million felons and stalkers, and no matter what our friends at the NRA say, there has not been a single hunter miss a day in the deer woods or a single sport shooter miss an event in Arkansas, not one, not one single day. It is just all a bunch of hogwash. But people are safer. The environment: The air is cleaner, the water is cleaner, 43 million more Americans breathing clean air. We have safer drinking water, safer food, 90 percent of our kids immunized for the first time. And we have set aside more land for permanent preservation than any administration since Theodore Roosevelt almost 100 years ago. And the economy got better, not worse. Now, health care: I remember their guy was saying all the time, you know, You had 8 years; you did not do anything on health care. And I thought, there you go again. When we took office, Al and I, Medicare was supposed to go broke last year-broke, out of money, kaput, busted. It is now good for 25 more years. And we have added preventive care for prostate cancer and for breast cancer. We have revolutionized care for diabetes. The American Diabetes Association said what we did was the most important thing since the development of insulin. We have got the number of people without health insurance going down for the first time in 12 years, because of the Children's Health Insurance Program we insisted be in the Balanced Budget Act. Now, there is a difference here, and I will come to that. What does Gore say? Pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights; pass a Medicare prescription drug program that all our seniors can afford to buy into. Give all our kids health insurance and insure as many of the working parents as we can afford to insure. Education: I notice that the Republicans have quit saying there is an education recession. So every now and then-usually the facts have no impact on them. I almost admire that about them. Never mind the facts, they know what their line is, and they just say it. But they have kind of quit saying that. But look at the facts here. The dropout rate is down; the high school graduation is up; the college-going rate is at an all-time high, thanks in part to the biggest expansion in college aid in 50 years. But this is important: The math, the reading, and the science scores are up; there has been a 300 percent increase in the last 3 years in African-American and Hispanic kids taking advanced placement tests. We have 800,000 kids now in after-school programs that were not there before we took office. We have got, thanks to the leadership of our Education Secretary, Dick Riley, all but one State have academic standards now against which they measure their kids and systems for identifying failing schools and turn them around. So the schools are getting better. Yes, the work is done by the schools, and yes, most of the money comes from the States. But the way we have spent this money has made a significant contribution to the continuing improvement of education in America. So what is their answer to that? Change it all. It is not like you do not have a choice here. People need to know what the choice is. On crime they have committed to repeal the 100,000 police program. They say never mind the fact we have got the lowest crime rate in 26 years, the Federal Government has got no business doing that. Al Gore, he wants to put 50,000 more police on the street and keep going until America is the safest big country in the world. On the environment, Al Gore wants to build on what we have done, and he will do even better because the economy is stronger. They want to repeal my order setting aside 40 million roadless acres in the national forests and to weaken the clean air standards. If you want to do that, you should vote for them, if you really believe that I have hurt the economy so bad. But if I was trying to hurt the economy with the environmental policies I have, I have done a poor job of it. I made a pure mess of that if I was trying to mess the economy up with my environmental policy. On health care, they are against the Patients' Bill of Rights, against the Medicare drug program, against our program to expand coverage. Oh, yes, they run these ads, and they say, We are for a Patients' Bill of Rights, too. What they do not say, because they cannot afford to say: We are for as much of a Patients' Bill of Rights as the HMO lobby in Washington will let us be for -which means it is a bill of suggestions, because if you get hurt, you cannot sue. On the Medicare drugs, they say, We are for Medicare drugs, too. What they do not say is, We are for as broad a plan as the big drug companies will let us be for -so they do not lose their monopoly position. And who cares if they leave half the seniors out who needs these drugs. You need to tell people this. They have a choice. But if they want every senior in this country to have access to medicine, if they want a real Patients' Bill of Rights, if they want to keep improving the environment as we grow the economy, if they believe that we ought to be making, for example, fuel out of farm products and biomass-let me just tell you, the reason ethanol never caught on, even though we had a plant in Arkansas way back in 1980, is that it takes 7 gallons of gasoline to make 8 gallons of ethanol. But the Department of Agriculture is funding research that I believe will bear fruit in the next couple of years. And when it happens they will crack the chemical mystery, and it will be just like when you turn crude oil into gasoline. Then you will be able to make 8 gallons of ethanol, and you will not even have to use corn-you can use rice hulls; you can use hay; you can use any kind of biomass fuel with one gallon of gasoline. And when that happens, we will all be going around getting 500 miles a gallon. Now, Al Gore will fund that and push that, and they will not . You can choose. But you talk about something that could revolutionize life for America's farmers, change everything in rural America and in rural Arkansas, that is it. So that is what Gore wants to do. They think we can drill our way out of the energy problem we have got. And in education, they want to repeal our commitment to put 100,000 teachers in the classroom. They say the Federal Government should not be doing that. All I know is that when we passed class size standards in Arkansas in the early grades, the achievement of our children went up, and it is happening all over America. We have the biggest number of kids in the history of our country, and we need more teachers in those schools. So you have got a choice. If you want to take down the 100,000 police and take down the 100,000 teachers and not have a real Patients' Bill of Rights and not have a Medicare prescription drug program that helps all of our people and not have a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition and weaken the environmental standards, you have got a choice. But if you kind of like having safer streets and a cleaner environment and knowing your National Government is supporting school reforms that work and helping more people get access to health care while we grow the economy, you have got to vote for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, and you need to tell the American people that. We have got these two big questions. Do you want to build on the prosperity and keep it going; do you want to build on the social progress and keep it going? And there is huge choices. And the third thing I'd like to say is this- and James Lee said this; it really meant a lot to me. You know, I have watched Rodney and James Lee for the last 20 years, and now they are maybe the two most popular people in the Cabinet. You know, James Lee is from Yell County; Rodney is from Lee County. And I think, you know, one of the reasons that they do so well is they came from little towns, and they learned to talk to people instead of talking governmentese, and they understand human nature. And here is James Lee Witt up here giving you a civil rights speech about how he has changed FEMA. But what he proved is that FEMA could be both competent and reflective of America. And the truth is, the more reflective of America it got, the more competent it got. Now, that is the third big issue. You know, I tried to make every American, even when they and, on many occasions, I am sure you, disagreed with some particular decision I made, I tried to make people feel at home with the White House, to know that I was pulling for ordinary Americans, that everybody-everybody-in this country interests counted, with the White House, with the Cabinet, with the decisions that were made. And I think it is really important that we keep moving forward to build one America. That is why I am for this hate crimes legislation and for employment nondiscrimination. That is why I am for stronger equal pay laws for women. That is why I think it is important that the Supreme Court continue to protect civil rights and human rights. This is a big deal in this election. They are against the hate crimes legislation. They are even against our attempts to strengthen the equal pay laws for women. And most people believe the only issue at stake in the Supreme Court is a woman's right to choose. That is not true. That is at stake, by the way, and it will certainly change depending on whether Al Gore wins or loses this election. You can go to the bank on that, because there will be at least two appointments in the next 4 years. But something that could have a more profound effect on America is that there is already a majority of 5-4 on that Court, that is determined to limit the ability of our National Government to protect and advance the civil rights and basic public health, safety, and welfare of the United States of America. Already, they have invalidated a provision of the Brady law because it required local folks to help us check criminal backgrounds. They invalidated a provision of the Violence Against Women Act-the Violence Against Women Act-because it required local government to do something to support our enforcement of that. And in the last couple of weeks, they invalidated an anti-AIDSdiscrimination law. Now, these are bills we even got the Republicans in Washington to vote for. The Supreme Court is to the right of the Republican Congress-already. You have got to think about this, and you have got to talk to people about this. People need to understand this is a big deal. Now, it ought to be a happy election because nobody has to say anything bad about anybody else. Near as I can see, the Vice President has never one time questioned the character or the integrity of his opponents. I wish I could say the same thing for them about him. But it still has not been too bad an election. The only problem is, people are fixing to go to the polls, and there is still not absolute clarity about what the choice is, what the consequences are to real people and their families. And look, this is a-I do not know if we will have another election in my lifetime where we have got so much prosperity, so much social progress, the absence of crisis at home, the absence of threats to our security abroad. And I just want to echo one or two things that Dale Bumpers said. First, let me say a word about Joe Lieberman. I have known him for 30 years. I met him when he was running for State senate, and I went to law school, in Connecticut. More than anybody else in the Congress, I think he clearly understands the approach that we brought to the country in 1992, whether you call it the New Democratic approach or the DLC approach or whatever. Basically, it was the idea that we would stop making false choices in Washington and try to unify our country. We could bring the deficit down and increase investment in education. We could be pro-business and pro-labor. We could be for a clean environment and for a growing economy. But you have got to be disciplined to do that. And he understands as well as anybody that the real appeal of our opponents in this election is, It is your money; let us just take it all now. Even though, as Dale Bumpers said, it has not materialized yet. And they want to talk about spending all this surplus right now. It reminds me of those letters we used to get in the mail from Ed McMahon, you know, the sweepstakes letter: You may have won $10 million. If you went out and spent the 10 million, you should vote for Bush and Cheney. If not, you should vote for Gore and Lieberman. And what Dale said about the Vice President is absolutely right. But let me say, I think I know something about economic policy. And I hope I have learned something about decisionmaking and about the world at large. It matters whether you know about these issues. It matters how hard you work. You know, this is a job. It is not just a media event every day. It is a job. A lot of reasons that these things have piled up, these good, positive changes, is that every day we had all these folks in the White House and all these folks in the Cabinet and Al Gore and I, we were working. We treated this like a job. We showed up, and we worked like crazy for 8 years. I got the gray hair to prove it. We worked at it. It matters whether you work hard, and it matters whether you can learn and whether you are curious. But it also matters what kind of experience you have. John Kennedy said the Presidency was preeminently a place of decisionmaking. Al Gore makes good decisions. When he had to come off the campaign trail a few days ago-we had all that trouble in the Middle East-and we were sitting in this room and for about 30 minutes he was asking questions from the various members of our national security team, I thought to myself, I would feel absolutely comfortable under any circumstances, with any crisis in the world, knowing that this man had to make the call. And that is a big deal, because it is still a world with real challenges out there. So, good man, good decisions. I think he will be a great President. And you know as well as I do that if everybody understood the differences and the positions like I just explained them to you today, we'd win. Do you have any doubt of that? Okay, so I will say again, you can win this election in Arkansas for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman if you want to bad enough. And you just think about what we have got. We have got a chance, as Dale said, that at least in my lifetime we have never had, and we may not have it again in our lifetime, to literally build the future of our dreams for our kids. So you just go ask people three questions: Do you want to keep this prosperity going and extend it to the people who have been left behind? Do you want to build on the progress of the last 8 years? Do you want to keep doing it as one America, keep bringing people together? Do you want to vote for somebody who is experienced and solid and proven, who will work hard, who knows a lot, who understands the future? You just have one choice. It is not close. But it needs to be clear. You have got 2 days to make it clear. Please, go do it. You will be proud you did for the rest of your life. Thank you, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksarkansascivicleadersluncheonlittlerockarkansas", "title": "Remarks at an Arkansas Civic Leaders Luncheon in Little Rock, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-arkansas-civic-leaders-luncheon-little-rock-arkansas", "publication_date": "05-11-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 1038, "text": "I have sought this opportunity to address you because it is clearly my duty to call your attention to the present cost of living and to urge upon you with all the persuasive force of which I am capable the legislative measures which would be most effective in controlling it and bringing it down. The prices the people of this country are paying for everything that it is necessary for them to use in order to live are not justified by a shortage in supply, either present or prospective, and are in many cases artificially and deliberately created by vicious practises which ought immediately be checked by law. They constitute a burden upon us which is the more unbearable because we know that it is wilfully imposed by those who have the power and that it can by vigorous public action be greatly lightened and made to square with the actual conditions of supply and demand. Some of the methods by which these' prices are produced are already illegal, some of them criminal, and those who employ them will be energetically proceeded against ; but others have not yet been brought under the law, and should be dealt with at once by legislation. I need not recite the particulars of this critical matter, the prices demanded and paid at the sources of supply, at the factory, in the food markets, at the shops, in the restaurants and hotels, alike in the city and in the village. They are familiar to you. They are the talk of every domestic circle and of every group of casual acquaintances even. It is a matter. of familiar knowledge, also, that a process has set in which is likely, unless something is done, to push prices and rents and the whole cost of living higher and yet higher, in a vicious cycle to which there is no logical or natural end. With the increase in the prices of the necessaries of life come demands for increase in wages demands which are justified if there be no other means of enabling men to live. Upon the increase of wages there follows close an increase in the price of the products whose producers have been accorded the increase not a proportionate increase, for the manufacturer does not content himself with that but an increase considerably greater that the added wage cost and for which the added wage cost is oftentimes hardly more than an excuse. The laborers who do not get an increase in pay when they demand it are likely to strike, and the strike only makes matters worse. It checks production, it affects the railways, it prevents distribution and strips the markets, so that there is presently nothing to buy, and there is another excessive addition to prices resulting from the scarcity. These are facts and forces with which we have become only too familiar; but we are not justified because of our familiarity with them, or because of any hasty and shallow conclusion that they are natural and inevitable, in sitting inactively by and letting them work their fatal results if there is anything that we can do to check, correct, or reverse them. I have sought this opportunity to inform the Congress what the Executive is doing by way of remedy and control, and to suggest where effective legal remedies are lacking and may be supplied. We must, I think, frankly admit that there is no complete immediate remedy to be had from legislation and executive action. The free processes of supply and demand will not operate of themselves, and no legislative or Executive action can force them into full and natural operation until there is peace. There is now neither peace nor war. All the world is waiting with what unnerving fears and haunting doubts who can adequately say? waiting to know when it comes a peace in which each nation shall make shift for itself as it can, or a peace buttressed 'and supported by the will and concert of the nations that have the purpose and the power to do and to enforce what is right. Politically, economically, socially, the world is on the operating table, and it has not been possible to administer any anaesthetic. It is conscious. It even watches the capital operation upon which it knows that its hope of healthful life depends. It cannot think its business out or make plans or give intelligent and provident direction to its affairs while in such a case. Where there is no peace of mind there can be no energy in endeavor. There can be no confidence in industry, no calculable basis for credits, no confident buying or systematic selling, no certain prospect of employment, no normal restoration of business, no hopeful attempt at reconstruction or the proper reassembling of the dislocated elements of enterprise until peace has been established and, so far as may be, guaranteed. Our national life has no doubt been less radically disturbed and dismembered than the national life of other peoples whom the war more directly affected, with all its terrible ravaging and destructive force, but it has been, nevertheless, profoundly affected and disarranged, and our industries, our credits, our productive capacity, our economic processes are inextricably interwoven with those of other nations and peoples most intimately of all with the nations and peoples upon whom the chief burden and confusion of the war fell and who are now most dependent upon the cooperative action of the world. We are just now shipping more goods out of our ports to foreign markets than we ever shipped before not foodstuffs merely, but stuffs and materials of every sort ; but this is no index of what our foreign sales will continue to be or of the effect the volume of our exports will have on supplies and prices. It is impossible yet to predict how far or how long foreign purchasers will be able to find the money or the credit to pay for or sustain such purchases on such a scale; how soon or to what extent foreign manufacturers can resume their former production, foreign farmers get their accustomed crops from their own fields, foreign mines resume their former output, foreign merchants set up again their old machinery of trade with the ends of the earth. All these things must remain uncertain until peace is established and the nations of the world have concerted the methods by which normal life and industry are to be restored. All that we shall do, in the meantime, to restrain profiteering and put the life of our people upon a tolerable footing will be makeshift and provisional. There can be no settled conditions here or elsewhere until the treaty of peace is out of the way and the work of liquidating the war has become the chief concern of our Government and of other Governments of the world. Until then business will inevitably remain speculative, and sway now this way and again that, with heavy losses or heavy gains, as it may chance, and. the consumer must take care of both the gains and the losses. There can be no peace prices so long as our whole financial and economic system is on a war basis. Europe will not, cannot, recoup her capital or put her restless, distracted peoples to work until she knows exactly where she stands in respect of peace; and what we will do is for her the chief question upon which her quietude of mind and confidence of purpose depend. While there is any possibility that the peace terms may be changed or may be held long in abeyance or may not be enforced because of divisions of opinion among the powers associated against Germany, it is idle to look for permanent relief. But what we can do we should do, and should do at once. And there is a great deal that we can do, provisional though it be. Wheat shipments and credits to facilitate the purchase of our wheat can and will be limited and controlled in such a way as not to raise, but rather to lower, the price of flour here. The Government has the power, within certain limits, to regulate that. We cannot deny wheat to foreign peoples who are in dire need of it, and we do not wish to do so; but, fortunately, though the wheat crop is not what we hoped it would be, it is abundant, if handled with provident care. The price of wheat is lower in the United States than in Europe, and can with proper management be kept so. By way of immediate relief, surplus stocks of both food and clothing in the hands of the Government will be sold, and, of course, sold at prices at which there is no profit. And by way of a more permanent correction of prices, surplus stocks in private hands will be drawn out of storage and put upon the market. Fortunately, under the terms of the Food Control act the hoarding of foodstuffs can be checked and prevented; and they will be, with the greatest energy. Foodstuffs can be drawn out of storage and sold by legal action, which the Department of Justice will institute wherever necessary; but so soon as the situation is systematically dealt with, it is not likely that the courts will often have to be resorted to. Much of the accumulating of stocks has no doubt been due to the sort of speculation which always results from an uncertainty. Great surpluses were accumulated because it was impossible to foresee what the market would disclose and dealers were determined to be ready for whatever might happen, as well as eager to reap the full advantage of rising prices. They will now see the disadvantage, as well as the danger, of holding off from the new process of distribution. Some very interesting and significant facts with regard to stocks on hand and the rise of prices in the face of abundance have been disclosed by, the inquiries of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, and the Federal Trade Commission. They seem to justify the statement that in the case of many necessary commodities effective means have been found to prevent the normal operation of the law of supply and demand. Disregarding the surplus stocks in the hands of the Government, there was a greater supply of foodstuffs in this country on June I of this year than at the same date last year. In the combined total of a number of the most important foods in dry and cold storage the excess is quite 19 per cent. And yet prices have risen. The supply of fresh eggs on hand in June of this year, for example, was greater by nearly Jo per cent than the supply on hand at the same time last year, and yet the wholesale price was 40 cents a dozen as against 3o cents a year ago. The stock of frozen fowls had increased more than 298 per cent., and yet the price had risen also from 34 1/2 cents per pound to 37 1/2 cents. The supply of creamery butter had increased 129 per cent., and the price from 41 to 53 cents per pound. The supply of salt beef had been augumented 3 per cent., and the price had gone up from $34 a barrel to $36 a barrel. Canned corn had increased in stock nearly 92 per cent., and had remained substantially the same in price. In a few foodstuffs the prices had declined, but in nothing like the proportion in which the supply had increased. For example, the stock of canned tomatoes had increased 102 per cent., and yet the price had declined only 25 cents per dozen cans. In some cases there had been the usual result of an increase of price following a decrease of supply, but in almost every instance the increase of price had been disproportionate to the decrease in stock. The Attorney General has been making a careful study of the situation as a whole and of the laws that can be applied to better it, and is convinced that, under the stimulation and temptation of exceptional circumstances, combinations of producers and combinations of traders have been formed for the control of supplies and of prices which are clearly in restraint of trade, and against these, prosecutions will be promptly instituted and actively pushed which will in all likelihood have a prompt corrective effect. There is reason to believe that the prices of leather, of coal, of lumber, and of textiles have been materially affected by forms of concert and cooperation among the producers and marketers of these and other universally necessary commodities which it will be possible to redress. No watchful or energetic effort will be spared to accomplish this necessary result. I trust that there will not be many cases in which prosecution will be necessary. Public action will no doubt cause many who have perhaps unwittingly adopted illegal methods to abandon them promptly and of their own motion. And publicity can accomplish a great deal. The purchaser can often take care of himself if he knows the facts and influences he is dealing with; and purchasers are not disinclined to do anything, either singly or collectively, that may be necessary for their selfprotection. The Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, and the Federal Trade Commission can do a great deal toward supplying the public, systematically and at short intervals), with information regarding the actual supply of particular commodities that is in existence and available, and with regard to supplies which are in existence but not available because of hoarding, and with regard to the methods of price fixing which are being used by dealers in certain foodstuffs and other necessaries. There can be little doubt that retailers are in part sometimes in large part responsible for exorbitant prices; and it is quite practicable for the Government through the agencies I have mentioned to supply the public with full information as 'to the prices at which retailers buy and as to the cost of transportation they pay, in order that it may be known just what margin of profit they, are demanding. Opinion and concerted action on the part of purchasers can probably do the rest. That is, these agencies may perform this indispensable service provided the Congress will supply them with the necessary funds to prosecute their inquiries and keep their price lists up to date. Hitherto the appropriation committee of the Houses have not always, I fear, seen the full value of these inquiries, and the departments and commissions have been very much straitened for means to render this service. That adequate funds be provided by appropriation for this purpose, and provided as promptly as possible, is one of the means of greatly ameliorating the present distressing conditions of livelihood that I have come to urge, in this attempt to concert with you the best ways to serve the country in this emergency. It is one of the absolutely necessary means, underlying many others, and can be supplied at once. There are many other ways. Existing law is inadequate. There are many perfectly legitimate methods by which the Government can exercise restraint and guidance. Let me urge, in the first place, that the present Food Control Act should be extended, both as to the period of time during which it shall remain in operation and as to the commodities to which it shall apply. Its provisions against hoarding should be made to apply not only to food, but also to feedstuffs, to fuel, to clothing, and to many other commodities which are indispensably necessaries of life. As it stands now, it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal, proclamation of peace. But I should judge that it was clearly within the constitutional power of the Congress to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce, and to exclude them from interstate shipment if the requirements of law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. May I not call attention to the fact, also, that, although, the present act prohibits profiteering, the prohibition is accompanied by no penalty? It is clearly in the public interest that a penalty should be provided which will be persuasive. To the same end I earnestly recommend, in the second place, that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the methods of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went in storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. It would serve as a useful example to the other communities of the country, as well as greatly relieve local distress, if the Congress were to regulate all such matters very fully for the District of Columbia, where its legislative authority is without limit. I would also recommend that it be required that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer. Such a requirement would bear a close analogy to certain provisions of the Pure Food Act, by which it is required that certain detailed information be given on the labels of packages of food and drugs. And it does not seem to me that we can confine ourselves to detailed measures of this kind, if .it is indeed our purpose to assume national control of the processes of distribution. I take it for granted that that is our purpose and our duty. Nothing less will suffice. We need not hesitate to handle a national question in a national way. We should go beyond the measures I have suggested. We should formulate a law requiring a Federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the' business of interstate shipment and in the methods of corporations which are engaged in it ; but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living. May I not add that there is a bill now pending before Congress which, if passed, would do much to stop speculation and to prevent the fraudulent methods of promotion by which our people are annually fleeced of many millions of hard earned money? I refer to the measure proposed by the Capital Issues Committee for the control of security issues. It is a measure formulated by men who know the actual conditions of business, and its adoption would serve a great and beneficent purpose. We are dealing, gentlemen of the Congress, I need hardly say, with, very critical and very difficult matters. We should go forward with confidence along the road we see, but we shall also seek to comprehend the whole of the scene amidst which we act. There is no ground for some of the fearful forecasts I hear uttered about me, but the condition of the world is unquestionably very grave and we should face it comprehendingly. The situation of our own country is exceptionally fortunate. We of all peoples can afford to keep our heads and to determine upon moderate sensible courses, of action which will insure us against the passions and distempers which are working such deep unhappiness for some of the distressed nations on the other side of the sea. But we may be involved in their distresses unless we help, and help with energy and intelligence. The world must pay for the appalling destruction wrought by the Great War, and we are part of the world. We must pay our share. For five years now the industry of all Europe has been slack and disordered. The normal crops have not been produced; the normal quantity of manufactured goods has not been turned out. Not until there are the usual crops and the usual production of manufactured goods on the other side of the Atlantic can Europe return to the former conditions; and it was upon the former conditions, not the present, that our economic relations with Europe were built up. We must face the fact that unless we help Europe to get back to her normal life and production a chaos will ensue there which will inevitably be communicated to this country. For the present, it is manifest, we must quicken, not slacken, our own production. We, and we alone, now hold the world steady. Upon our steadfastness and selfpossession depend the affairs of nations everywhere. It is in this supreme crisis the crisis for all mankind that America must prove her mettle. In the presence of a world confused, distracted, she must show herself selfpossessed, selfcontained, capable of sober and effective action. She saved Europe by her action in arms; she must now save it by her action in peace. In saving Europe she will save herself, as she did upon the battlefields of the war. The calmness and capacity with which she deals with and masters the problems of peace will be the final test and proof of her place among the peoples of the world. And, if only in our own interest, we must help the people overseas. Europe is our biggest customer. We must keep her going or thousands of our shops and scores of our mines must close. There is no such thing as letting her go to ruin without ourselves sharing in the disaster. In such circumstances, face to face with such tests, passion must be discarded. Passion and a disregard for the rights of others have no place in the counsels of a free people. We need light, not heat, in these solemn times of selfexamination and saving action. There must be no threats. Let there be only intelligent counsel, and let the best reasons win, not the strongest brute force. The world has just' destroyed the arbitrary force of a military junta. It will live under no other. All that is arbitrary and coercive is in the discard. Those who seek to employ it only prepare their own destruction. We cannot hastily and overnight revolutionize all the processes of our economic life. We shall not attempt to do so. These are days of deep excitement and of extravagant speech; but with us these are things of the surface. Everyone who is in real touch with the silent masses of our great people knows that the old strong fibre and steady selfcontrol are still there, firm against violence or any distempered action that would throw their affairs into confusion. I am serenely confident that they will readily find themselves, no matter what the circumstances, and that they will address themselves to the tasks of peace with the same devotion and the same stalwart preference for what is right that they displayed to the admiration of the whole world in the midst of war. And I entertain another confident hope. I have spoken today chiefly of measures of imperative regulation and legal compulsion, of prosecutions and the sharp correction of selfish processes; and these no doubt are necessary. But there are other forces that we may count on besides those resident in the Department of Justice. We have just fully awakened to what has been going on and to the influences, many of them very selfish and sinister, that have been producing high prices and imposing an intolerable burden on the mass of our people. To have brought it all into the open will accomplish the greater part of the result we seek. I appeal with entire confidence to our producers, our middlemen, and our merchants to deal fairly with the people. It is their opportunity to show that they comprehend, that they intend to act justly, and that they have the public interest sincerely at heart. And I have no doubt that housekeepers all over the country and every one who buys the things he daily stands in need of will presently exercise a greater vigilance, a more thoughtful economy, a more discriminating care as to the market in which he buys or the merchant with whom he trades than he has hitherto exercised. I believe, too, that the more extreme leaders of organized labor will presently yield to a sober second thought and, like the great mass of their associates, think and act like true Americans. They will see that strikes undertaken at this critical time are certain to make matters worse, not better worse for them and for everybody else. The worst thing, the most fatal thing, that can be done now is to stop or interrupt production or to interfere with the distribution of goods by the railways and the shipping of the country. We are all involved in the distressing results of the high cost of living, and we must unite, not divide, to correct it. There are many things that ought to be corrected in the relations between capital and labor, in respect of wages and conditions of labor, and other things even more farreaching, and I, for one, am ready to go into conference about these matters with any group of my fellow countrymen who know what they are talking about and are willing to remedy existing conditions by frank counsel rather than by violent contest. No remedy is possible while men are in a temper, and there can be no settlement which does not have as its motive and standard the general interest. Threats and undue insistence upon the interest of a single class make settlement impossible. I believe, as I have hitherto had occasion to say to the Congress, that the industry and life of our people and of the world will suffer irreparable damage if employers and workmen are to go on in a perpetual contest as antagonists. They must, on one plan or another, be effectively associated. Have we not steadiness and selfpossession and business sense enough to work out that result? Undoubtedly we have, and we shall work it out. In the meantime now and in the days of readjustment and recuperation that are ahead of us let us resort more and more to frank and intimate counsel and make ourselves a great and triumphant nation by making ourselves a united force in the life of the world. It will not then have looked to us for leadership in vain.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressthehighcostliving", "title": "Address to Congress On the High Cost of Living", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-the-high-cost-living", "publication_date": "08-08-1919", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 836, "text": "Thank you. Let me say, first of all, I thank you for that. I am profoundly moved. And I was thinking when I was watching David Mixner make those remarks that 30 years ago, when I let him sleep on my floor when we were much younger men in England, and I did not charge him a nickel for it I never dreamed that either of us would be in this place tonight doing these things. David's life has taken a lot of twists and turns since then. He is had his ups and his downs like all the rest of us. But I can tell you something, when I met him when he was young, I thought I had never met a person whose heart burned with the fire of social justice so strongly. He has never forgotten the roots of his childhood. He has never forgotten not only the pain that he and other gay and lesbian Americans have endured; he also cares for other people who are dispossessed and downtrodden and underrepresented and often forgotten. And tonight I was watching him, and he introduced his wonderful sister who has also been a friend of mine for nearly 30 years now and I was thinking how fortunate we are in this country at this time, with all the things we have had to do, to have had his energy, his heart, his devotion, his passion. It was 8 years ago that he and Scott Hitt and a few other ANGLE members met with me this week 8 years ago, here. Then in May of '92 we had a big event out here, and some of you were there. And I told you that I had a vision of America, and you were part of it, that we were all part of the same community. Well, tonight I thank you for helping to make that happen. I thank my good friend Governor Gray Davis for the leadership he has given in California. I thank our leader in the House of Representatives, who when David made that crack about the Canterbury Tales and how we are known by our traveling companions it kind of made me feel sorry for Dick Gephardt. You talk about a guy that gets up and goes to work every day under adverse conditions and continues to do the right thing, he does. But I know that Representatives Baldwin and Becerra and Kennedy and Sherman and Waxman are here, and they are his good fellow travelers. We just may need five more in the company to make it a much better trip. I want to thank Bill Melamed, Skip Paul, Gwen Baba, Roberta Bennett for putting this together. I want to thank the members of our administration who came: Sean Maloney, Karen Tramontano, Minyon Moore, Fred Hochberg, Richard Socarides, Marsha Scott. And I want to thank Scott Hitt, especially, who is been the Chair of the AIDS council. He is having his last meeting as Chair on Monday, and he is been magnificent, and we ought to give him a big hand. I'd also like to thank the Gay Men's Chorus. I was back there feverishly trying to write down all those lines. I want to call Hillary and give her those best lines tonight. You know, I am trying to remember them all. It was unbelievable. If someone would furnish me with the lyrics of that song, I would be eternally grateful. You know, I'd like to put what brought us all here tonight just for a minute. I know a lot of other people are going to speak and have a lot of great things to say, but I would like to put this in, just for a moment, in the context of history and the larger context of our future, and how the fight for equal rights and equal opportunity and full participation to build one America fits in with all the other things we should be doing as a country, and how what we are at home will determine what we can do around the world in the new millennium. When I ran for President in 1992, most Americans felt things were pretty dismal in this country. The economy was in bad shape; the society was divided; all the social indicators crime, welfare, and other things were going in the wrong direction. Politics was, as we all remember from the convention they had back then on the other side, a matter of division, you know, just drive a wedge in society and make sure your wedge is bigger than their wedge; you get more votes, you win; and if everybody is all torn up and upset, who cares, you are in power. And over and over and over again, things in Washington were sort of repeating themselves like a broken record. And I felt that we could do better with a unifying vision. That is why I set out a vision of America, and you were part of it. But I also had a vision that we could build an economy that was good for working people and employers. I believed we could build a country where we could grow the economy and make the environment better, not worse. I have always believed that the real purpose of life and growth is to try and figure out how to develop these unifying visions and to move closer to them and to break down all these funny walls we have to put up in our minds to organize life into little boxes so we can figure out how to get from here to there. And, you know, in '92, the American people just sort of took a chance on me and Al Gore. I mean, it was an argument we made and there was no evidence for it because the other crowd had been in so long. We just made an argument. And it was not an easy race. A month after we had that meeting out here in May of '92, I won the California primary. And the headline the next day was that the exit poll showed that all the people that voted for me really wanted Ross Perot to be President. And I was in third place. And then he and President Bush got in a fight about who messed up whose daughter's wedding or something. You remember that? I mean, it was an amazing and I thought to myself, people do not have jobs; they are being foreclosed on; why are you guys fighting about this? The wedding went off without a hitch. What is this about? And somehow the American people decided to give me a chance, decided to give Al and Hillary and Tipper and all the people that came in the administration a chance. I guess what I'd like to say tonight, first of all not with arrogance, but with humility is that we now know that there is evidence that we are right and that pulling things together and moving forward actually works. We have the lowest unemployment in 29 years, the lowest welfare rolls in 32 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest crime rates in 26 years, the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years, the highest homeownership in history, the longest peacetime expansion in history. And you have to 15 million Americans took leave under the family leave law. And when it was vetoed in the previous administration, they said, Oh, well, we have got to veto this bill because if we let people take time off from work when their babies are born or their parents are sick, why, it will ruin the small business economy. And every year, we have set a new record for new small businesses in America. Ninety percent of our kids are immunized against serious diseases for the first time, our young children. We are giving 5 million more of them health insurance. A hundred thousand young people served in AmericCorps. I could just go on and on. And along the way, we gave America the most diverse, truly representative government by far in the history of America. That included you and everybody else. What I want to say to you is, this is not an argument anymore. We have evidence. And so you should be of good cheer. And when you look ahead to these elections in 2000, you should be absolutely sure that anybody who is not with you knows they are doing it in the face of the evidence. And because what really bothers me about what is going on in Washington now, it is like there are all these people out there making decisions in the congressional majority as if the last 6 1/2 years just did not happen. And that bothers me. So I say to you, when they say, looking at the Vice President and our party, Well, America needs a change, I agree with that. America always needs a change. We have got a lot more to do on your agenda. America needs a change. The question is not whether we will change, but how are we going to change? How are we going to change? You mark my words, the world is changing so fast in how we work and live and relate to each other and folks around the globe, that the world will change. The question is, how? And are we going to use this unprecedented moment, the chance of a lifetime to say, okay, what are our big challenges out there, and seize them? Or are we going to do what got us into so much trouble in the first place? Are we going to pretend that the last 6 1/2 years just did not happen? That is very important. And I want to try to put the things that you are thinking about now into that context. What are the really big challenges facing America that affect you, too? One, the aging of America I hate it because I am doing it. But I am the oldest of the baby boomers. The number of people over 65 will double in the next 30 years; there will be two people working for every one person retired and drawing Social Security. Now, we have never been in a position, until now, in my lifetime, to deal with that challenge. But we now have the ability to run the life of Social Security out 50 years, to add more than a decade to the life of Medicare, to cover prescription drugs for elderly people threequarters of them cannot afford quality prescription drugs today and to do it in a way that all of you who are younger than that should rejoice about. Because I can tell you those of us in the baby boom generation are plagued by the notion that our retirement will be so expensive for our country that it will burden our children and our ability to give our grandchildren the childhoods they deserve. But we can fix it now. So I gave them a plan to do it. So far, they say no. Another thing that really bothers me: we have got the largest and most diverse group of children in our school in history. We never had over 53 million children in schools, and they come from more different backgrounds than ever before. And that will be a godsend to 21st century America if, but only if, they all have a world-class education. And I think they are entitled to it. So I gave Congress a plan to build and modernize 6,000 schools and hire 100,000 teachers for smaller classes; make sure all the kids had computers in their classrooms; make sure we stopped social promotion, but had after-school programs for the kids who needed it; and more of these charter schools that California has led the way in bringing to our children. So far, they said no. Funny thing, maybe Mr. Gephardt will talk about this later, but one of the most interesting things is last year, right before the election in '98, they got religion on this education program. And they supported this big downpayment on our plan for 100,000 teachers, and we funded 30,000 of those teachers. And you had those real liberals, like Mr. Armey going home. This is serious business; ask Dick. You had these real liberals going out and saying, Man, this is a great thing we have done. We have made a big downpayment on 100,000 teachers; we are going to put 30,000 teachers out there, and this is a great Republican program because there is no bureaucracy in it. We just give it to the schools, and they hire the teachers. They thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread before the election. They have just voted not only to refuse to fund any more of those but to no longer earmark the money for the 30,000. So there is a big difference here. I am worried about the families of our country. I am worried about all these working people. How are they going to have the child care they need? How are they going to have the health care they need? Why do not we pass the Patients' Bill of Rights that protects working people? There is a difference between the two parties on that, and I think it is important. We are finally going to get a chance we have been working for 2 years finally going to get a chance to vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House next week. I am very worried about this fabulous economy, because we have left some people behind. Yes, we have got the lowest poverty rate in 20 years, but there are still people in places that have not felt this recovery. If you come from a lot of you come from other places, the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, the Indian reservations, many of the inner cities. So I want to do some things that I think will change all that. I want to, first of all, give Americans with money the same incentives to invest in poor areas in America we give them to invest in poor areas around the world. I think that is important. I hope in the near future we will be able to make access to the Internet as universal as telephone access is. It will have a huge impact on the economy. Last night I was in northern California, and I was with some people who work with eBay. A lot of you probably buy things on eBay. It seems like everybody does now. And I learned that over and above the employees of that company, there are now over 20,000 people, including a lot of people that used to be on welfare, who actually make a living buying and selling things, trading on eBay, over 20,000 people. Well, I am telling you, that means nothing at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where the unemployment rate is 73 percent. Now, we can do better. And we ought not to quit until every American has the chance to participate in our prosperity if he or she is willing to work. And I will not rest until that happens. I want you to keep a checklist in your mind, and when I get to the end, ask yourself what is all this about, what is it got to do with you as Americans? This is part of being part of America. I think we need to do more, not less, for the environment. The Vice President has this livability agenda to deal with, using all kinds of computer technology to alleviate traffic congestion, to buy more green space in urban areas. We are trying to lead the world toward recognizing that this global warming is real, but that you do not have to end your economic growth, because now there are technologies available to allow us to grow the economy as we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. There are people in the other party who believe that this is some sort of subversive plot to wreck America's economic future. Not very long ago, I came out here and went to San Bernardino, to the Inland Empire, and we announced a housing development for low income working people in which the developers pledged, by the use of energy conservation technologies, to cut the utility bills of these low income working people by 40 percent. And I just got a report that the average reduction is 60 percent. That is good for the economy. That is not bad for the economy, and it is good for the environment. Let me just mention a couple of other things. I am very concerned that America, even though we have got the lowest crime rate in 26 years, is still a pretty dangerous country compared to other countries. We should be the safest big country in the world. This is a free and prosperous place. We welcome all kinds of people. It is not rational. Why are not we the safest country in the world? Because we have not taken reasonable steps, not enough of them, to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. And because, frankly, even though we have put 100,000 more police on the street in community policing, we have still got neighborhoods that do not have enough coverage. So I gave Congress a plan to deal with both those things: put 50,000 more police officers out there to prevent crime in the highest crime areas of the country and to deal with guns and so forth. They say no. Our crowd says yes; their crowd says no. Big difference. What about our role in the world? I have tried, from Bosnia to Kosovo to the Middle East to Northern Ireland, to stand up for the idea that people ought not to be murdered or moved wholesale because of their race or their religion. We have worked to support other countries and to build the capacity in Africa to prevent future Rwandas, because people ought not to be murdered because of what tribe they are in. And you can define tribe however you want. We are about to start a great debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to end nuclear testing, something that Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy wanted us to do years ago. We are finally going to have a chance to do it. In so many of these areas, there are partisan differences which surprise me. And let me come back to you. Why are we for the hate crimes legislation? Why are we for ENDA? Because if we cannot build one America, it is going to be very hard to have a unifying force that will deal with every other one of these issues. And that is what I want you to think about. Do not you think that it is interesting that here we are on the verge of this new millennium with all these absolutely breathtaking technological breakthroughs that people who are technologically challenged, like me, can hardly keep up with? I mean, is not it amazing to you that we have modernity is bursting out all over in the form of high technology. And yet, the world's largest problem and America's largest problem, that you can see when those kids got shot at that Jewish school and that Filipino postalworker was murdered here; that you could see when that guy who said he belonged to a church that did not believe in God but did believe in white supremacy killed all those people of color and wounded others in Illinois and Indiana; that you could see when Matthew Shepard was murdered and James Byrd was torn apart; and that you can see in the tribal slaughters of Rwanda, and the persecution of the Kosovar Albanians or the Bosnian Muslims or the fights in Northern Ireland or the continued agonies of the Middle East here we are on the verge of this great modern world, where we can make movies with virtual reality now, and virtual reality seems sometimes more real than what is real, and the biggest problem we have got is the primitive, ageold fear and hatred and dehumanization of the other people who are not like us. And so I say I am nearly done; I just want to say this I am going to do everything I can, every day that I have, to remind people of that, that we have to be one America. We can have honest differences over issues, but we cannot have honest differences about whether we share a common humanity. And we cannot be under the illusion that either material prosperity or technological breakthroughs alone can purge the darkness in our hearts. I believe that America's best days are still out there. I believe with all my heart that we can find a way to marry prosperity and peace and humanity. But we must have a unifying vision. I want to say, again, I am grateful to people who have worked in my administration who have made me more alive to the concerns of your community, not only those who themselves are gay and lesbian, but others, beginning with my Vice President, who has been terrific on all of that in ways you will never know. But people are still scared of people who are not like them. And other people are scared of themselves, and they are afraid they will not count unless they have got somebody to look down on. And if you have to find somebody to look down on, it must be somebody that is different from you. Because if you look down on somebody who is just like you, then you are looking down on yourself. And so we, in our little minds, come up with all these boxes. But all of life is a struggle to find a more and more and more and more unifying vision that, at least for me, makes us both more human and more in tune with our maker. I wish I could have done better. But we have done pretty well. And we are a long way from where we were. But I want you to think about this a little bit every day between now and next year, 13 months until the millennial election to define what America will be like; whether we will continue to embrace these big challenges and change in a positive way, building on what we now have evidence of; whether we will continue to look for those unifying visions that allow us all to join hands and go forward together. And I want you to remember the enthusiasm with which you greeted me tonight. And I want you to remember that it is easy to shout in the moment. But the world is turned by those who day in and day out, with courage and determination and heart and hope, stay the course. We need you. America needs you. I still believe in the future of America, and you are a part of it. Thank you, and God bless you.

{"id": 750, "text": "Thank you. John, thank you very much. I thought for a minute you were going to say I was your favorite rabbi, but. I appreciate you giving me a chance to come. I too want to thank Mr. Saban for his vision and for sponsoring this forum. I am honored to be with you. Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us. Justice Breyer, I am pleased to see you yet again. I thank Ambassador Indyk. Minister Mofaz, it is good to see you, sir, and I appreciate you being here for this forum. I want to thank the Members of Congress who have joined us, members of the diplomatic corps, and of course, the distinguished guests. The Saban Forum is one of the world's premier venues for discussion on the Middle East. I thank you for the debates you provoke and the differences you have made. And I am honored to be with you. Over the past 8 years, I have had the privilege to see the Middle East up close. I have stood on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and I have hiked the cliffs of Masada. I have enjoyed dinner in the desert of Abu Dhabi and prayed at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. I have looked into the eyes of courageous elected leaders from Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, and the Palestinian Territories. I have been convinced that no region is more fundamental to the security of America or the peace in the world than the Middle East. This evening I will share some thoughts on our policies in the region these past 8 years, and our vision for the future: a Middle East where our friends are strengthened and the extremists are discredited, where economies are open and prosperity is widespread, and where all people enjoy the life of liberty that is the universal gift of an Almighty God. From our earliest days as a nation, the Middle East has played a central role in American foreign policy. One of America's first military engagements as an independent nation was with the Barbary pirates. One of our first consulates was in Tangiers. Some of the most fateful choices made by American Presidents have involved the Middle East, including President Truman's decision to recognize Israel 60 years ago this past May. In the decades that followed that brave choice, American policy in the Middle East was shaped by the realities of the cold war. Together with strong allies in the Middle East, we faced down and defeated the threat of communism to the region. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the primary threat to America and the region became violent religious extremism. Through painful experience, it became clear that the old approach of promoting stability is unsuited to this new danger, and that the pursuit of security at the expense of liberty would leave us with neither one. Across the Middle East, many who sought a voice in the future of their countries found the only places open to dissent were radical mosques. Many turned to terror as a source of empowerment. And as the new century dawned, the violent currents swirling beneath the Middle East began to surface. In the Holy Land, the dashed expectations resulting from the collapse of the Camp David peace talks had given way to the second intifada. Palestinian suicide bombers struck with horrific frequency and lethality. They murdered innocent Israelis at a pizza parlor or aboard buses or in the middle of a Passover Seder. Israeli Defense Forces responded with large-scale operations. And in 2001, more than 500 Israelis and Palestinians were killed. Politically, the Palestinian Authority was led by a terrorist who stole from his people and walked away from peace. In Israel, Ariel Sharon was elected to fight terror and pursue a greater Israel policy that allowed for no territorial concessions. Neither side could envision a return to negotiations or the realistic possibility of a two-state solution. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Saddam Hussein had begun his third decade as the dictator of Iraq, a reign that included invading two neighbors, developing and using weapons of mass destruction, attempting to exterminate Marsh Arabs and many Kurds, paying the families of suicide bombers, systematically violating U.N. resolutions, and firing routinely at British and U.S. aircraft patrolling a no-fly zone. Syria continued its occupation of Lebanon, with some 30,000 troops on Lebanese soil. Libya sponsored terror and pursued weapons of mass destruction. And in Iran, the prospect for of reform was fading, the regime's sponsorship of terror continued, and its pursuit of nuclear weapons was largely unchecked. Throughout the region, suffering and stagnation were rampant. The Arab Human Development Report revealed a bleak picture of high unemployment, poor education, high mortality rates for mothers, and almost no investment in technology. Above all, the Middle East suffered a deep deficit in freedom. Most people had no choice and no voice in choosing their leaders. Women enjoyed few rights, and there was little conversation about democratic change. Against this backdrop, the terrorist movement was growing in strength and in ambition. For three decades, violent radicals had landed painful blows against America: the Iranian hostage crisis, the attacks on our Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103, the truck bombing of the World Trade Center, the attack on Khobar Towers, the bombing of our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the strike on the USS Cole. And then came September the 11th, 2001, when 19 men from the Middle East carried out the worst attack on the United States since the strike on Pearl Harbor 67 years ago this weekend. In the space of a single morning, 9/11 etched a sharp dividing line in our history. We realized that we are in a struggle with fanatics pledged to our destruction. We saw that conditions of repression and despair on the other side of the world could bring suffering and death to our own streets. With these new realities in mind, America reshaped our approach to the Middle East. We made clear that we will defend our friends, our interests, and our people against any hostile attempt to dominate the Middle East, whether by terror, blackmail, or the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. We have carried out this new strategy by following three overriding principles. First, we took the offense against the terrorists overseas. We are waging a relentless campaign to break up extremist networks and deny them safe havens. As part of that offensive, we pledged to strengthen our partnership with every nation that joins in the fight against terror. We deepened our security cooperation with allies like Jordan and Egypt, and with our friends in the gulf. Saudi Arabia, long a breeding ground for radicalism, has become a determined partner in the fight against terror, killing or capturing hundreds of Al Qaida operatives in the Kingdom. We dramatically expanded counterterrorism ties with partners in North Africa. And we left no doubt that America would stand by our closest ally in the Middle East, the State of Israel. Second, we made clear that hostile regimes must end their support for terror and their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, or face the concerted opposition of the world. This was the approach we took in Iraq. It is true, as I have said many times, that Saddam Hussein was not connected to the 9/11 attacks. But the decision to remove Saddam from power cannot be viewed in isolation from 9/11. In a world where terrorists armed with box cutters had just killed nearly 3,000 of our people, America had to decide whether we could tolerate a sworn enemy that acted belligerently, that supported terror, and that intelligence agencies around the world believed had weapons of mass destruction. It was clear to me it was clear to members of both political parties and to many leaders around the world that after 9/11, that was a risk we could not afford to take. So we went back to the United Nations Security Council, which unanimously passed Resolution 1441 calling on Saddam Hussein to disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. With this resolution, we offered Saddam Hussein a final chance to comply with the demands of the world. And when he refused to resolve the issue peacefully, we acted with a coalition of nations to protect our people and liberated 25 million Iraqis. When Saddam regimes fell when Saddam's regime fell, we refused to take the easy option and install a friendly strongman in his place. Even though it required enormous sacrifice, we stood by the Iraqi people as they elected their own leaders and built a young democracy. When the violence reached its most dire point, pressure to withdraw reached its height. Yet failure in Iraq would have unleashed chaos, widened the violence, and allowed the terrorists to gain a new safe haven, a fundamental contradiction to our vision for the Middle East. So we adopted a new strategy and deployed more troops to secure the Iraqi people. When the surge met its objective, we began to bring our troops home under the policy of return on success. Yesterday, building on the gains made by the surge, the democratic Government of Iraq approved two agreements with the United States that formalize our diplomatic, economic, and security ties and set a framework for the drawdown of American forces as the fight in Iraq nears its successful end. After 9/11, we also confronted Libya over its weapons of mass destruction. The leader of Libya made a wise choice. In 2003, Colonel Qadhafi announced that he would abandon his weapons of mass destruction program. He concluded that the interests of his people would be best served by improving relations with America, and Libya turned over its nuclear centrifuges and other deadly equipment to the United States. The defeat of Saddam also appears to have changed the calculation of Iran. According to our intelligence community, the regime in Tehran had started a nuclear weapons program in the late 1980s, and they halted a key part of that program in 2003. America recognized that the most effective way to pursue persuade Iran to remove its nuclear weapons renounce its nuclear weapons ambitions was to have partners at our side, so we supported an international effort led by our allies in Europe. This diplomacy yielded an encouraging result when Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment. Sadly, after the election of President Ahmadi-nejad, Iran reversed course and announced it would begin enriching again. Since then, we have imposed tough sanctions through United Nations resolutions. We and our partners have offered Iran diplomatic and economic incentives to suspend enrichment. We have promised to support a peaceful civilian nuclear program. While Iran has not accepted these offers, we have made our bottom line clear: For the safety of our people and the peace of the world, America will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. Third, America identified the lack of freedom in the Middle East as a principal cause of the threats coming from the region. We concluded that if the region continued on the path it was headed, if another generation grew up with no hope for the future and no outlet to express its views, the Middle East would continue to simmer in resentment and export violence. To stop this from happening, we have resolved to help the region steer itself toward a better course of freedom and dignity and hope. We are engaged in a battle with the extremists that is broader than a military conflict and broader than a law enforcement operation. We are engaged in an ideological struggle. And to advance our security interests and moral interests, America is working to advance freedom and democracy as the great alternatives to repression and terror. As part of this effort, we are pressing nations across the region, including our friends, to trust their people with greater freedom of speech and worship and assembly. We are giving strong support to young democracies. We are standing with reformers and dissidents and human rights activists across the region. Through new efforts like the Middle East peace partnership initiative and the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative, we are supporting the rise of vibrant civil societies. We are also advancing a broader vision that includes economic prosperity, quality health care and education, and women's rights. We have negotiated new free trade agreements in the region, supported Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and proposed a new Middle East free trade area. We have signed Millennium Challenge agreements with Jordan and Morocco to grant American assistance in return for anticorruption measures, free market policies, and investments in health and education. We are training Middle Eastern schoolteachers, translating children's school books into Arabic, and helping young people get visas to study here in the United States. We are encouraging Middle Eastern women to get involved in politics and to start their own businesses and take charge of their health through wise practices like breast cancer screening. Efforts like these extend hope to the corners of despair, and in this work we have had a lot of help, but no finer ambassador of good will than my wife, Laura Bush. Finally, to advance all the principles that I have outlined supporting our friends and pressuring our adversaries and extending freedom America has launched a sustained initiative to help bring peace to the Holy Land. At the heart of this effort is the vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. I was the first ENTITY to call for a Palestinian state and sup-port and to build support for the two-state solution has been a top priority of my administration. To earn the trust of Israeli leaders, we made it clear that no Palestinian state would be born of terror, we backed Prime Minister Sharon's courageous withdrawal from Gaza, and we supported his decision to build a security fence, not as a political border but to protect the people from terror. To help the Palestinian people achieve the state they deserve, we insisted on Palestinian leadership that rejects terror and recognizes Israel's right to exist. Now that this leadership has emerged, we are strongly supporting its efforts to build institutions of a vibrant democratic state. With good advice from leaders like former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Generals Jones, Dayton, Fraser, and Selva, the Palestinians are making progress toward capable security forces, a functioning legal system, Government Ministries that deliver services without corruption, and a market economy. In all our efforts to promote a two-state solution, we have included Arab leaders from across the region, because we fully understand that their support will be essential for the creation of a state and lasting peace. Last fall at Annapolis, Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab leaders came together at an historic summit. President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert agreed to launch direct negotiations on a peace agreement. Nations around the globe, including many in the Arab world, pledged to support them. The negotiations since Annapolis have been determined and substantial. Secretary Rice has encouraged both sides by hosting a series of trilateral meetings. And while the Israelis and Palestinians have not yet produced an agreement, they have made important progress. As they stated to the Quartet, they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future. On this issue, and on our overall approach to the Middle East these past 8 years, America has been ambitious in vision, we have been bold in action, and we have been firm in purpose. Not every decision I have made has been popular, but popularity was never our aim. Our aim was to help a troubled region take the difficult first steps on the long journey to freedom and prosperity and hope. Some have called this idealistic, and no doubt it is. Yet it is the only practical way to help the people of the Middle East realize the dignity and justice they deserve. And it is the only practical way to protect the United States of America in the long term. As with any large undertaking, these efforts have not always gone according to plan, and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes. For example, the fight in Iraq has been longer and more costly than expected. The reluctance of entrenched regimes to open their political systems has been disappointing. There have been unfortunate setbacks at key points in the peace process, including the illness suffered by Prime Minister Sharon, the Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections, and the terrorist takeover of Gaza. Despite these frustrations and disappointments, the Middle East in 2008 is a freer, more hopeful, and more promising place than it was in 2001. For the first time in nearly three decades, the people of Lebanon are free from Syria's military occupation. Libya's nuclear weapons equipment is locked away in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Places like the UAE and Bahrain are emerging as centers of commerce. The region the regime in Iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before. Terrorist organizations like Al Qaida have failed decisively in their attempts to take over nations; they are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the Arab world. Iraq has gone from an enemy of America to a friend of America, from sponsoring terror to fighting terror, and from a brutal dictatorship to a multireligious, multiethnic constitutional democracy. Instead of the Iraq we would see if a Saddam Hussein were in power an aggressive regime vastly enriched by oil, defying the United Nations, bullying its Arab neighbors, threatening Israel, and pursuing a nuclear arms race with Iran we see an Iraq emerging peacefully with its neighbors, welcoming Arab ambassadors back to Baghdad, and showing the Middle East a powerful example of a moderate, prosperous, free nation. The most vexing problem in the region the Israeli-Palestinian conflict there is now greater international consensus that at any point in modern memory. Israelis, Palestinians, and Arabs recognize the creation of a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state is in their interests. And through the Annapolis process, they started down a path that will end with two states living side by side in peace. In fits and starts, political and economic reforms are advancing across the Middle East. Women have run for office in several nations and been named to important Government positions in Bahrain and Oman and Qatar, the UAE and Yemen. Trade and foreign investment have expanded. Several nations have opened up private universities, and Internet use has risen sharply. Across the region, conversations about freedom and reform are growing louder. Expectations about government responsiveness are rising, and people are defying the condescending view that the culture of the Middle East is unfit for freedom. There are still serious challenges facing the Middle East. Iran and Syria continue to sponsor terror. Iran's uranium enrichment remains a major threat to peace. Many in the region still live under oppression. Yet the changes of the past 8 years herald the beginning of something historic and new. At long last, the Middle East is closing a chapter of darkness and fear and opening a new one written in the language of possibility and hope. For the first time in generations, the region represents something more than a set of problems to be solved or the site of energy resources to be developed. A free and peaceful Middle East will represent a source of promise and home of opportunity and a vital contributor to the prosperity of the world. Those who ask what this future will look like need only look around. We see the new story of the Middle East in Iraqis waving ink-stained fingers, with Lebanese taking to streets in the Cedar Revolution. We see it in women taking their seats in elected Parliaments and bloggers telling the world their dreams. We see it in the skyscrapers rising above Abu Dhabi and liv-ing and thriving Middle Eastern businesses that are now connected to the global economy. We see it in a Saudi king sponsoring an interfaith dialogue, Palestinian reformers fighting corruption and terror, and Israelis who love their ancient land, but want to live in peace. These are striking images, and they do point the way to a brighter future. I believe the day will come when the map of the Middle East shows a peaceful, secure Israel beside a peaceful and democratic Palestine. I believe the day will come when people from Cairo and Riyadh to Baghdad and Beirut to Damascus and Tehran live in free and independent societies, bound together by the ties of diplomacy and tourism and trade. The day will come when Al Qaida and Hizballah and Hamas are marginalized and then wither away, as Muslims across the region realize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision and the injustice of their cause. Earlier this year, I laid out this vision in my address to the Israeli Knesset and then in my address to the World Economic Forum in Egypt. It was not a Jewish vision or an Arab vision or an American vision; it is a universal vision. It unites all who yearn for freedom and peace in the Middle East. And if we lead, and if we persevere, and if we keep faith in our ideals, that vision will become a reality someday. Thanks for letting me come, and God bless.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesabanforum", "title": "Remarks at the Saban Forum", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-saban-forum", "publication_date": "05-12-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 999, "text": "Senator Hollings and Senator Eastland, Senator Stennis, Governor Edwards, Chairman Bragg, distinguished Members of Congress, those representatives from State government, who share the leadership of America, and my friends in a personal way who come out to welcome me back to the South: It is not often that a president comes as a substitute speaker. I realize that my brother, Billy, was the first choice. I understand that the Southern Legislative Conference--could not afford Billy here. I was going to go by Plains on this trip, but I could not get a room there. I am going to go to Yazoo City tonight and then to New Orleans later on. I am very grateful to be here as president. I have learned a lot in this first 6 months. When I got to Washington and sought advice, someone said, Just act like you are a president and treat Congress like the Georgia Legislature. It did not work at first. Very quickly I realized that the Congress was treating me like I was still Governor of Georgia, but now, with the help of a great number of friends in the Congress, we have formed a kind of relationship that ought to exist between the White House and our Nation's Capitol. I think there is a genuine sense of sharing of responsibility and the burden of government, and you are a part of that circle of leaders in the State legislature and the Governors' offices, who join in with the president, the Congress, and others in making sure that our government works. I have become even more proud of being an American. And I have become even more proud of being a southerner, too. I am also proud to be with you today where two great rivers come together, as they say in Charleston, to form the Atlantic Ocean. This is one of our Nation's most gracious cities. And I want to talk to you today about the hopes and problems that we as southerners and as Americans share together. I feel a special kinship with your State legislators. For 4 years I was a member of the Georgia Senate, and I still prize State government not only for the talents of those who work in it but, as Fritz Hollings says, for the closeness to the people it represents. Our Southern States have a proud tradition of local, independent government, and now you are the heirs of that tradition. But we in the South have also felt, perhaps more directly than many others, some of the rapid changes that have taken place in this modern age. More and more our own lives are shaped by events in other cities, decisions in other States, tensions in other parts of the world. And as Americans we cannot overlook the way that our fate is bound to that of other nations. This interdependence stretches from the health of our economy, through war and peace, to the security of our own energy supplies. It is a new world in which we cannot afford to be narrow in our vision, limited in our foresight, or selfish in our purpose. When I took office almost exactly 6 months ago, our Nation was faced with a series of problems around the world--in southern Africa, the Middle East, in our relationships with our NATO allies, and on such tough questions as nuclear proliferation, negotiations with our former adversaries, a Panama Canal treaty, human rights, world poverty. We have openly and publicly addressed these and other many difficult and controversial issues--some of which had been either skirted or postponed in the past. As I pointed out in a recent press conference, a period of debate, disagreement, probing was inevitable. Our goal has not been to reach easy or transient agreements, but to find solutions that are meaningful, balanced, and lasting. Now, a president has a responsibility to present to the people of this Nation reports and summations of complex and important matters. I feel more secure as president making decisions if I know that either the most difficult, the most complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by you and understood and debated by the Congress. In the past I think our Nation's leaders have been guilty of making decisions in secret. And even when the decision turns out to be the fight one, it makes the president, the Secretary of State speak with a weak voice when they speak alone. Today, I want to discuss a vitally important aspect of our foreign relations, the one that may most directly shape the chances for peace for us and for our children. I would like to spell out my view of what we have done and where we are going in our relations with the Soviet Union and to reaffirm the basic principles of our national policy. I do not have any apology for talking about foreign affairs at a southern legislative conference, because foreign affairs and those difficult decisions ought never to be made with a concept that we can abandon common sense and the sound judgment and the constructive influence of the American people. For decades, the central problems of our foreign policy revolved around antagonism between two coalitions, one headed by the United States and the other headed by the Soviet Union. Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with the Soviet Union. This competition is still critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war. But however important this relationship of military balance, it cannot be our sole preoccupation to the exclusion of other world issues which also concern us both. Even if we succeed in relaxing tensions with the U.S.S.R., we could still awake one day to find that nuclear weapons have been spread to dozens of other nations who may not be as responsible as are we. Or we could struggle to limit the conventional arsenals of our two nations, to reduce the danger of war, only to undo our efforts by continuing without constraint to export armaments around the world. As two industrial giants, we face long-term, worldwide energy crises. Whatever our political differences, both of us are compelled to begin conserving world energy and developing alternatives to oil and gas. Despite deep and continuing differences in world outlook, both of us should accept the new responsibilities imposed on us by the changing nature of international relations. Europe and Japan rose from the rubble of war to become great economic powers. Communist parties and governments have become more widespread and more varied and, I might say, more independent from one another. Newly independent nations emerged into what has now become known as the Third World. Their role in world affairs is becoming increasingly significant. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have learned that our countries and our people, in spite of great resources, are not all-powerful. We have learned that this world, no matter how technology has shrunk distances, is nevertheless too large and too varied to come under the sway of either one or two super powers. And what is perhaps more important of all, we have, for our part, learned, all of us, this fact, these facts in a spirit not of increasing resignation, but of increasing maturity. I mention these familiar changes with which you are familiar because I think that to understand today's Soviet-American relationship, we must place it in perspective, both historically and in terms of the overall global scene. The whole history of Soviet-American relations teaches us that we will be misled if we base our long-range policies on the mood of the moment, whether that mood be euphoric or grim. All of us can remember times when relations seemed especially dangerous and other times when they seemed especially bright. We have crossed those peaks and valleys before. And we can see that, on balance, the trend in the last third of a century has been positive. The profound differences in what our two governments believe about freedom and power and the inner lives of human beings, those differences are likely to remain; and so are other elements of competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. That competition is real and deeply rooted in the history and the values of our respective societies. But it is also true that our two countries share many important overlapping interests. Our job---my job, your job--is to explore those shared interests and use them to enlarge the areas of cooperation between us on a basis of equality and mutual respect. As we negotiate with the Soviet Union, we will be guided by a vision of a gentler, freer, and more bountiful world. But we will have no illusions about the nature of the world as it really is. The basis for complete mutual trust between us does not yet exist. Therefore, the agreements that we reach must be anchored on each side in enlightened self-interest-what is best for us, what is best for the Soviet Union. That is why we search for areas of agreement where our real interests and those of the Soviets coincide. We want to see the Soviets further engaged in the growing pattern of international activities designed to deal with human problems--not only because they can be of real help but because we both should be seeking for a greater stake in the creation of a constructive and peaceful world order. When I took office, many Americans were growing disillusioned with detente---President Ford had even quit using the word, and by extension, people were concerned with the whole course of our relations with the Soviet Union. Also, and perhaps more seriously, world respect for the essential rightness of American foreign policy had been shaken by the events of a decade---Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate. At the same time, we were beginning to regain our sense of confidence and our purpose and unity as a nation. In this situation, I decided that it was time for honest discussions about international issues with the American people. I felt that it was urgent to restore the moral bearings of American foreign policy. And I felt that it was important to put the U.S. and Soviet relationship, in particular, on a more reciprocal, realistic, and, ultimately, more productive basis for both nations. It is not a question of a hard policy or of a soft policy, but of a clear-eyed recognition of how most effectively to protect our own security and to create the kind of international order that I have just described. This is our goal. We have looked at the problems in Soviet-American relations in a fresh way, and we have sought to deal with them boldly and constructively with proposals intended to produce concrete results. I'd like to point out just a few of them. In the talks on strategic arms limitations, the SALT talks, we advanced a comprehensive proposal for genuine reductions, limitations, and a freeze on new technology which would maintain balanced strategic strength. We have urged a complete end to all nuclear tests, and these negotiations are now underway. Agreement here could be a milestone in U.S.-Soviet relations. We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked France, Britain, and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives. We have undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We have encouraged the Soviets to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere. We have begun regular consultations with the Soviet leaders as cochairmen of the prospective Geneva conference to promote peace in the Middle East. We and our allies are negotiating together with the Soviet Union and their allies in the Warsaw Pact nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe. We have renewed the 1972 agreement for cooperation in science and technology, and a similar agreement for cooperation in outer space. We are seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger. In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on Vladivostok accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists. The Vladivostok negotiations of 1974 left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation. Meanwhile, new developments in technology have created new concerns--the cruise missile, the very large intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Soviets. The Soviets are worried about our cruise missiles, and we are concerned about the security of our own deterrent capability. Our cruise missiles are aimed at compensating for the growing threat to our deterrent, represented by the buildup of strategic Soviet offensive weapons forces. If these threats can be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be no doubt that the United States can and will do what it must to protect our security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture. Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation. But none of these proposals that I have outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well. When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I am not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, Soviet and American, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our two countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we will also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life. We have made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the Soviet side about SALT and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the Soviets are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us, let no one doubt that we will persevere. What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides. We shape our own policies to accommodate a constantly changing world, and we hope the Soviets will do the same. Together we can give this change a positive direction. Increased trade between the United States and the Soviet Union would help us both. The American-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission has resumed its meetings after a long interlude. I hope that conditions can be created that will make possible steps toward expanded trade. In southern Africa we have pressed for Soviet and Cuban restraint. Throughout the nonaligned world, our goal is not to encourage dissension or to redivide the world into opposing ideological camps, but to expand the realm of independent, economically self-reliant nations, and to oppose attempts at new kinds of subjugation. Part of the Soviet Union leaders' current attitude may be due to their apparent-and incorrect--belief that our concern for human rights is aimed specifically at them or is an attack on their vital interests. There are no hidden meanings in our commitment to human rights. We stand on what we have said on the subject of human rights. Our policy is exactly what it appears to be: the positive and sincere expression of our deepest beliefs as a people. It is addressed not to any particular people or area of the world, but to all countries equally, yes, including our own country. And it is specifically not designed to heat up the arms race or bring back the cold war. On the contrary, I believe that an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation is far more conducive to an increased respect for human rights than an atmosphere of belligerence or hatred or warlike confrontation. The experience of our own country this last century has proved this over and over again. We have no illusions that the process will be quick or that change will come easily. But we are confident that if we do not abandon the struggle, the cause of personal freedom and human dignity will be enhanced in all nations of the world. We are going to do that. In the past 6 months we have made clear our determination--both to give voice to Americans' fundamental beliefs and to obtain lasting solutions to East-West differences. If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our choice. We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship will evolve in a more constructive direction. I cannot forecast whether all our efforts will succeed. But there are things which give me hope, and in conclusion I would like to mention them very briefly. This place where I now stand is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It is a beautiful town of whose culture and urban charm all Americans are proud--just as the people of the Soviet Union are justly proud of such ancient cities as Tbilisi or Novgorod, which there they lovingly preserve, as you do in Charleston, and into which they infuse a new life that makes these cities far more than just dead remnants of a glorious historical past. Although there are deep differences in our values and ideas, we Americans and Russians belong to the same civilization whose origins stretch back hundreds of years. Beyond all the disagreements between us--and beyond the cool calculations of mutual self-interest that our two countries bring to the negotiating table--is the invisible human reality that must bring us closer together. I mean the yearning for peace, real peace, that is in the very bones of us all. I am absolutely certain that the people of the Soviet Union, who have suffered so grievously in war, feel this yearning for peace. And in this they are at one with the people of the United States. It is up to all of us to help make that unspoken passion into something more than just a dream. And that responsibility falls most heavily on those like you, of course, but particularly like ENTITY Brezhnev and me, who hold in our hands the terrible power conferred on us by the modern engines of war. Mr. Brezhnev said something very interesting recently, and I quote from his speech: It is our belief, our firm belief, he said, that realism in politics and the will for detente and progress will ultimately triumph, and mankind will be able to step into the 21st century in conditions of peace, stable as never before. I see no hidden meaning in that. I credit its sincerity. And I express the same hope and belief that Mr. Brezhnev expressed. With all the difficulties, all the conflicts, I believe that our planet must finally obey the Biblical injunction to follow after the things which make for peace.

{"id": 827, "text": "Thank you all very much. It is an honor to be here to swear in my friend. I first want to say it is a treat to see Mr. and Mrs. Allbaugh, from the great State of Oklahoma; and his brother; most importantly, Diane and Taylor. Thank you all for being here. Of course, you would not have missed it. When I was a Governor, Joe and I used to travel a lot together, and a lot of times people would come up and say, Is he your bodyguard? He was not , but I always felt a little safer when he was around. And that is the kind of man he is, and that is the kind of man I wanted to run FEMA. When the worst happens anywhere in America, I can assure you folks will be confident when Joe Allbaugh arrives on the scene. He is not just a commanding presence or his stylish haircut it is his confidence, his character, and his calm when trouble comes. This is not mere speculation. Last Wednesday at 10:54 in the morning, an earthquake rocked the State of Washington, injuring hundreds of people and causing billion dollars of property damage. By 11:30 that night, Joe Allbaugh was on the scene ready to assist people in need. That is the kind of man he is. I could not have made it to Washington without him. And I cannot tell you how honored I am that he has come to Washington to serve his country. We never know where FEMA will be needed next, but we do know what makes this Agency so effective: more than 2,000 dedicated employees all across America; 4,000 standby employees, ready if needed; an ethic of professionalism; and a willingness to work with State and local officials to help people in need. As Governor, I worked with FEMA officials. Joe and I have great respect for the outgoing Director, James Lee Witt, and for the Acting Director, John Magaw. A lot of change is needed in Washington, but in this Agency the standards are already high. Every year, many thousands of Americans live through floods and hurricanes and fires. They know from personal experience that FEMA is an example of the Federal Government at its best. And I will tell you from personal experience that FEMA has a new Director that speaks to America at its best. When he acts, he will have my full confidence. When he speaks, it will inspire confidence in others. This Agency is in strong and steady hands. Joe will be at the White House many times in the next few years. In the nature of his job, they will not always be the happiest of times. But Joe will help Americans deal with the worst in the best, most compassionate way possible.

{"id": 852, "text": "It is great to be back at the National Women's Law Center, surrounded by so many powerful and accomplished women. This is not a new experience for me. Some of you know my household is filled with powerful, accomplished women. I want to thank Marcia and Duffy for that wonderful, heartfelt introduction and for their extraordinary leadership. Most of all, I want to recognize tonight's honorees, the women and men there is some men in the group who endured insults and beatings and risked their lives 50 years ago because they believed in a different future for their daughters and for their sons. The Freedom Riders had faith that America could still be perfected. And as has been noted, it is only because they did that I am able to stand here as President of the United States of America. Which is why, when I had a chance to see them backstage, I gave them all a kiss and a hug. And I told them that even though I was in diapers at the time, I knew something important was going on. What a remarkable group of people, and how blessed we are to have them here, sharing their stories and continuing to inspire us in so many ways. We are truly grateful to you. Being here tonight reminds us that history is not always made in fact, often is not made by generals or presidents or politicians. Change does not always happen quickly or easily. Change happens when a group of students and activists decide to ride a bus down South, knowing full well the dangers that lie ahead. Change happens when a group of legal secretaries decides that the world needs more women attorneys, and they start an organization to fight for people like them. Change happens when one woman decides: I do not want to be paid less than that man who is doing the exact same job over there. I want to be paid the same. Change depends on persistence, and change depends on determination. That is how change happens. That is how change happened on August 4, 1961. That is how change will happen today, especially when it comes to securing equal rights and equal opportunities for women. Now, the last time I spoke here was in 2005. I was brand new to Washington. Some of you still could not pronounce my name. And when I was thinking about what to say to this group, I was not just thinking about the legal cases you have helped to win or the milestones that you have helped to reach. I was thinking about my daughters and the world I want them to grow up in. And I think it is fair to say that a few things have changed since then. Michelle helpfully reminds me that I have more gray hair now. More people know my name, which I have come to realize is a mixed blessing. Malia and Sasha have grown into these strong, smart, remarkable young women. They are growing too fast. Malia has a cell phone now, certainly a mixed blessing. But even after all this time, my wish for my daughters and for yours remains the same. I want them to go out into a world where there is no limit to how big they can dream, how high they can reach. And being here with all of you gives me hope and makes me determined, because although this journey is far from over, today our daughters live in a world that is fairer and more equal than it was 6 years ago, a world where more doors are open to them than ever before. Today, for the first time in history, our daughters can see not one, not two, but three women sitting on the bench of the highest court in the land. They can come to the White House and see that the top four lawyers on my staff some of the sharpest legal minds I have ever come across are women. They can read about the extraordinary leadership of a woman in the House of Representatives who went by the title Madam Speaker. They can turn on the news and see that one of the most formidable Presidential candidates we have ever seen has become one of the best Secretaries of State that this country has ever known. Today, women make up almost half of our workforce, the majority of students in our colleges and our graduate schools. Women are breaking barriers in every field, from science to business to sports to the Armed Forces. And today, thanks to health care reform that many of you helped pass, insurance companies can no longer deny coverage based on preexisting conditions like breast cancer or charge women more because they are more likely to incur costs for things like birth childbirth. Those same companies must cover the cost of preventive services like mammograms, domestic violence counseling, contraception. We are making sure that women in the military and our veterans get the care that they need. Today, thanks to the tireless efforts of people like Lilly Ledbetter one of my favorite people, love that woman we were backstage talking, and she was just saying how grateful she was, how much of a responsibility she now felt with this bill having been passed that was named after her. I said: Lilly, all that did was just that was just icing on the cake. It was your work, your courage, your determination that changed things. All we did was ratify what you had already done. And because of her and other courageous women and some of the women in this room tonight, it is easier for women to demand equal pay for equal work. We passed tax credits that are keeping more women out of poverty and helping them reach the middle class. Companies are being encouraged to make workplaces more flexible so women do not have to choose between being a good employee and a good parent. One of the first things I did after taking office was to create a White House Council on Women and Girls to make sure that every agency in the Federal Government considers the needs of women and girls in every decision they make, not as a sideshow, not as a box to check, but something that is sustained each and every day. So this is progress. This is progress. This is change. It is laborious. Sometimes it is frustrating. But it is real. And of course, one thing we have learned from the women's movement, from the civil rights movement, from the workers' movement, from every step that we have made to make this country more equal and more just, is that there is always more work to do. There are always more challenges to meet. And that is especially true today, with so many Americans struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In the early days of this crisis, women were not hit quite as hard as men. Many of the jobs that we have lost over the last decade have been in construction and manufacturing, industries that traditionally had been dominated by men. And of the 15 job categories projected to grow the most in this country over the next decade, all but 2 are occupied primarily by women. But over the last couple of years, women have continued to lose jobs, especially in the public sector. It does not help that mothers are the primary or cobreadwinners in 63 percent of households, even as women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar a man does. Some of these women are single moms like my mother was, struggling just to keep up with the bills or pay a mortgage they cannot afford. I still remember my mother waking me up she worked, was going to school, and still took the time to wake me up before she went to work to go over my lessons before she left. And I would complain and grumble, and she would say, Well, this is no picnic for me either, buster. These are the quiet heroes. Their names do not make the history books. They are never complaining well, I will not say they are never complaining I was thinking about that for a second never hesitating to work that extra shift or that extra job if that is what it takes to give their children a better life. And in many ways, that is why we are all here tonight, because we know that it is up to us to keep fighting for them all those women out there making sure that they are treated fairly and equally. As hard as they are working, as much as they are sacrificing, as many responsibilities that they shoulder each and every day, we have got to make sure that they are getting the opportunities that they deserve, that somebody is standing up for them. Somebody is fighting for them. Somebody is looking out for them. Somebody is rooting for them. Of course, let us be clear about one thing: When we talk about these issues that primarily affect women, these are not just women's issues. When women make less than men for the same work, that hurts the entire family who has to get by with less. It hurts businesses who have fewer customers with money to spend. When a health care plan denies women coverage because of a preexisting condition, that puts a strain on emergency rooms, drives up health care costs for everybody. When any of our citizens cannot fulfill their potential because of factors that have nothing to do with their talent or their character or their work ethic, that diminishes us. It says something about who we are. Here is a fact: If you want to look around the world, those countries that are developing fastest, that are doing the best, where their children are succeeding in school, those are societies that respect the rights of women, that are investing in our women. Lifting women up lifts up our economy and lifts up our country. Now unfortunately, not everybody in Washington seems to feel the same way. In recent weeks, Republicans in the Senate have come together three times to block jobs bills that independent economists say would boost our economy and put millions back to work, including women. Each of these bills was made up of the same kinds of proposals that Democrats and Republicans have historically supported in the past, and they were fully paid for. And even though they were supported by a clear majority of the American people Republicans, Democrats, Independents every single Senate Republican said no. Said no to putting hundreds of thousands of teachers, three-quarters of them women, back in front of the classroom where they belong. No to putting construction workers back on the job and funding a special program that gets more women involved in the construction industry. Well, I have got news for Congress: We are not done yet. In the weeks ahead, they are going to get a chance to vote on whether we give a tax cut to virtually every small-business owner in America, including 900,000 women. These are folks who run the restaurants and stores and beauty shops and other small businesses that create two-thirds of all new jobs. There is no reason they should not get a break. The American people are with me with on this, and Republicans in Congress should be with me too, because it is right for the country. Instead, they are spending time focusing on how to turn back the clock. Instead of figuring out how to put more Americans back to work, they have been trying to figure out how to take away preventive care that is covered under the Affordable Care Act. Instead of making life easier for women in this country, they want to let insurance companies go back to charging higher prices just because you are a woman. Instead of working to boost our economy, they are out there spending time trying to defund Planned Parenthood and prevent millions of women from getting basic health care that they desperately need: Pap smears and breast exams. That is not the right direction for this country. These folks know they cannot win on the big issues, so they are trying to make the fight about social issues that stir up their base. They are spending their time trying to divide this country against itself rather than coming together to lift up our country. And we do not have to settle for that. The American people should not have to settle for that. And that is why I need your help. As leaders in your communities, I need you to tell Congress to do their jobs by worrying about the jobs of the millions of Americans they were elected to serve. I need you to make your voices heard. And for my part, I promise to keep doing everything I can to help every single American achieve their own piece of the American Dream. That is not just a promise I am making as a President. That is a promise I am making as a grandson who saw my grandmother hit the glass ceiling at the bank where she worked, passed over for promotions in favor of men that she trained. It is a promise I am making as a husband who watched Michelle balance work and family with grace and poise, even when it has not been easy. It is a promise I am making as a father who wants my daughters to grow up in a world where every door is open to them, where there are no limits on what they can achieve. It is a promise I am making as the inheritor of the extraordinary sacrifices that were made by these Freedom Riders, as a friend of people like Lilly Ledbetter, who embody all that is good and decent in this country. It is a promise I am making as an American who believes that the future of our country depends on expanding the circle of opportunity for everybody, because that next generation of smart, powerful women, they are already knocking on the door. They are coming, and we need to get ready. Last month, I got a chance to meet the winners of the Google Science Fair. This is an international competition of high school students, the cutting edge of technology and science. All three of the winners turned out to be Americans. All three were girls. They had beat out 10,000 other applicants from more than 90 countries. So I had them in the Oval Office, and they explained their projects to me and I pretended that I understood what they were talking about. There is a picture of this conversation hanging up in the West Wing right now, and they are I have got a puzzled look on my face and they are being very patient. So one of the winners, Shree Bose, discovered a promising new way to improve treatment for ovarian cancer at the age of 17. Then I asked another winner, Lauren Hodge, if she had skipped a grade in school; she was quite petite. And she informed me very politely that she had actually skipped two. Okay. It is people like Shree and Lauren, all of you who are here tonight, who make me hopeful about the future. There is a direct line between those women who sat in those jail cells and those young girls explaining their science project in the Oval Office. There is a direct connection. Because that is what America is about, a place where ideas are born and dreams can grow and where a student in a classroom or a passenger on a bus or a legal secretary in an office can stand up and say, I am going to change the world. We have always been a nation where anything is possible. That is the kind of nation that we are. That is the kind of opportunity that must exist here in America. That is the kind of opportunity that must exist for every American, no matter what they look like or where they come from. We have come a long way towards making this country more open and more free for our daughters and theirs. We have got a lot more work to do. With the National Women's Law Center, I am confident that the next time I visit, we will be even closer to guaranteeing every one of our children get the future they deserve. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalwomenslawcenterawardsdinner", "title": "Remarks at the National Women's Law Center Awards Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-womens-law-center-awards-dinner", "publication_date": "09-11-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 935, "text": "Thank you very much, thank you. And thank you to Charlie for that introduction, which was so beautiful and for your fearless leadership of Turning Point Action and Turning Point USA. Thank you, Charlie, very much. Let me also express my incredible appreciation to the thousands of bold, young, and proud American patriots that are with us today. What a crowd. What a crowd. And you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It is about 110 degrees or something. That is an incredible group. Thank you. Thank you to the people outside. We love you. You are the pulse of our movement, so true, and you are the ones who will make America great again. I started saying make America great again, again, think of that. Think about that because nobody's done what we did in four years, the greatest economy, we will be talking about it. We have plenty of time. Does everybody have some time? I said, I look forward to this speech. They said, Oh good. I said, How long a flight is it? About five and a half hours? So I said, Oh, can we maybe do it by Zoom? But Zoom will never replace the real thing. Do we agree? Especially for our great young students, it cannot replace being in the classroom, can it? With your help, we will stand up for democracy and for justice. We will fight for truth, transparency and accountability, and we will not stop until we have restored our American birthright of honest, free, and fair elections. We are gathered here in Phoenix to show our support for election integrity and for the brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate. Thank you. You created a movement all over the country. This is now starting all over the country. I am hearing Texas wants to do a forensic audit, I just heard. Even though I won Texas by a lot, I said, You should do it because you will find out what is going on in this country. It is crazy. When you hear defund the police, when you hear no IDs Of course, now they are trying to get into the, We never really said that. It is crazy. But when you hear open borders, how about open borders? All this stuff. In my opinion, there is no way they win elections without cheating. There is no way. There is no way. No second amendment. They are against energy. We were energy independent two months ago, energy independent. Now we are not energy independent. I saw where they are negotiating now with OPEC again. Here we go again to negotiate. They are negotiating right now with OPEC and with Russia. We had so much oil. We did not know what the hell to do with it. It is not even believable. They closed up so many sites. Today I want to send our profound and everlasting gratitude to every Arizona Republican who had the fortitude and the backbone to defy the lying media. Look at that. That is a lot of media. A lot of media. See the red lights are starting to go off now. They are going, Cut. Cut. He is at it again. He is talking about the media. It is easy. Hey look. Some of them are down almost 80%. Can you believe it? And that is because they lose credibility, but I want to just finish it. We want to demand a full forensic audit of the results of Maricopa county. I particularly want to thank Arizona Senate president, Karen Fan. She is been great, she is been strong. And I predict when the votes come in and that is her in the Senate, I think they are going to be so horrible that she is going to go three steps further than she ever thought she'd have to because they will be in my opinion, and again, I am not involved. They are involved. This is the Arizona state Senate. I think the results will be so outrageous. You have already seen some of them come that they are going to go many steps further than they would have. Judiciary committee chairman Warren Peterson. Where is Warren? Thank you, Warren. Thank you, Warren. He is here someplace. Thank you, Warren. We did win. We really did. Not me. We all won. We won. Everybody. When you looked at election night, we were up by so much. It was over at 10 o'clock and then all of a sudden they close the tabulation areas. They closed everything and we wake up and all of a sudden it is tied or we are losing. And nobody believes that. They do not believe it. I tell you right now, they do not believe it. State senators, JD Mesnard, Kelly Townsend. Kelly, you have been so incredible. Kelly, JD, thank you. Where is Kelly? Kelly, thank you. Great job. Tremendous courage, you have. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it really a lot. Nancy Bartow. Nancy, wherever you may be. Nancy, thank you. Thank you very much. Great job. Thanks, Nancy. Nice to meet you. See, they all think I am involved. I am not involved. These are people that did this by themselves. They wanted to do it. They had to do it. They saw what was going on and they did it. So I am meeting some of you for the first time. Senator Kerr, where Senator Kerr? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Somebody who is been a warrior again. I do not know him. Sonny Borelli, he is great. Where is Sonny? There he is. I recognize that man from television, but I do not know Sonny. But Sonny, you are really an amazing guy and a brave guy and a strong smart guy. Thank you very much. All of you. Vince leech. Where is Vince? Thank you, Vince. Thank you. Thank you very much, Vince. Great job. Somebody else who is really been out there that is been a brave who wants to go many steps further than anybody, Wendy Rogers. Thank you, Wendy. Great job. You knew the answer early on when they were waiting for results, but you knew the answer. And I think Kelly Townsend is around someplace, where is Kelly? Good. Okay. I did not see you in the audience now. I want it. Okay. And by the way, Kelly has to get a special Really great. Wendy, Kelly, Borrelli, what a group. I would not want to fight. I would not want to fight you. Thank you. I like that. Wendy. We just have a new one, Wendy, Kelly, and Borelli that is going to be a very famous That is going to be a very famous someday, I suspect. Good. Great to meet you. Great. Republican party chairwoman, somebody that has tremendous courage I will tell you. Somebody that is been fighting so long and so hard and she never stops. And some people love her. And some people do not like her as much. I happen to love her, but she is. She is really a fighter. And she fights your governor who does not do a damn thing. She is fighting. He does not do a damn thing. Chairwoman Kelly Ward. Kelly? I called up Kelly recently. I said, Why would not the governor want an audit? Maybe everything will prove to be correct, which we know will not happen. I said, Why would not this governor Doug Ducey When I did rallies, he always wanted to be in the front row. Sir, could you mention my name please? I will mention. And I did these rallies and he was not very popular, but he won by a lot because he ran against a very defective candidate, which they found out after they nominated that Democrat. But I'd introduce him and I would not get much of an applause and I'd get a lot of boos. And I kept saying, This guy's not very popular. But now you know what? He is not popular with me either. They came to see me. They said, Sir, would you like him to run for the Senate? I said, He is not getting my endorsement. I can tell you. The Mitch McConnell, there is another beauty. The Mitch McConnell Republican. The Mitch McConnell. The old Crow. He was losing his election in the I will tell you, Kentucky is a great place. I love Kentucky. They love me and I love them and I was way up and he was losing by two points. And he said, Sir, I'd like to see you. He comes over. Would you give me a big endorsement? And could you do a television commercial? And I did not love the idea because I am not too high on him, but it was between him or a woman named Amy McGrath, a Democrat. She had 93 million sitting in the bank and he was two down and he was going to get blown away and I endorsed him and he went up 20 points, 20. She did not even spend her money. She had no chance because of my endorsement he went up 20 points and then he got up and said the nastiest things about me. That is the way politics is, I guess. Sonny, it is not that way in Arizona is it? Oh yeah. I think it is, Kelly. I think it is. No, it is not as bad. That was amazing. You endorse somebody, you help somebody. I do not want any praise. I do not want anything, but I do not want to have that kind of a thing happen. So it is one of those things. But what you are doing here is incredible as everyone here fully understands. The 2020 election was a total disgrace. It was the most corrupt. And I tell this to people. I tell it to Republicans and a lot of them are very good people and they say, Well, sir, we have to get onto the future. Let me tell you, you are not going to have a future. First of all, our nation is being destroyed, but you are not going to have a future in '22 or '24 if you do not find out how they cheated with hundreds of thousands and even millions of votes, because you will not win anything. You will not win anything. And I tell Republicans, I say, You do not realize, because some of them they are good meaning, really a lot of them, most of them. We have certain people that are not good. They do not have the Mitt Romney's the little Ben Sasse's of the world. They do not have I could name a few of them. Little Ben Sasse. Could I have your endorsement? Yes. The day after he won, he goes and starts going after ENTITY. But you know what? That is the way it is. But you know, I tell people, this is the biggest issue there is. This is bigger than the border. This is bigger than anything. This is the biggest issue. And I see it just here and I'd say I'd make a speech. And I talk about the border because we straightened out the border. We had the strongest border in history. We straightened out the border and that is a big deal. But when you look at all of the death and destruction that this election has caused and wait til you see what is happening with inflation. Wait til you see the real numbers on inflation and what is going on. And wait til you go to the pump today and you see $3.75 cents. We were at a $1.87 for a gallon of gasoline. It was the most corrupt, dishonest, and unfair election in the history of our country. The Democrats know it. The corrupt media, right back there a lot of people, they know it. Big tech knows it. And most importantly, we, the American people know it. We know it. But because of the steadfast conservatives all across our nation and that is really happening now. If you look at what is going on all across. They have come from so many different states to look at your audit procedures that they go back and I will call them and say, How did you like it? What did you think? They said, We do not believe it. And then they are starting their own audits now. That is what is happening. They are coming and looking. They are looking at what Karen and Kelly They are looking what they all set up here and they cannot Wendy, what you have done. Borelli, I love you. Borelli, you are Italian. I hope you are all Italian, Borelli? That is why I get along. That is why I like him. Good. He is tough as nails too, but you know what? They are coming in. They are looking and they go back to their state and they say, This is the most incredible thing that we have seen anytime. Why would not somebody want election integrity? Why would not they want to know? And I would be very happy. It will not happen, but I would be very happy if they did it and everything was perfect. But you are not going to find that. In fact, the preliminary numbers are a total disaster and we are going to go over those numbers. The facts are coming out. The truth is being uncovered and the crime of the century is being fully exposed. Thank you. With what inflation is doing to our country. The crime has never been higher than it is. Now you have in Chicago, hundreds of people are being shot every weekend in Afghanistan. We have not lost one soldier in Afghanistan for the last year and a half. In Chicago, they have 188 people shot over a weekend. Many of whom die. That is worse than any war zone anywhere in the world. Chicago and New York, what is happening in New York. The crime in New York. And Rudy Giuliani was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City, by the way. And they are going after him because he understands it and they are going after him. And he is a true patriot. What they are doing to Rudy is a disgrace. Greatest mayor and the greatest prosecutor. I mean, he was a crime fighter. He was a crime fighter, but this was the greatest mayor. And you know, if I would have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, it would not have meant as much. Now you realize what having a great mayor is all about because when you look at what the hell is happening to our cities, run by Democrats, all run by Democrats. There is never been any It is a crime wave the likes of which we have never seen before. It is scary. People are afraid to walk down to the streets of New York and nobody gets prosecuted except Republicans, by the way. In every fake news story about the election, they always begin by stating that claims are unproven. There is the fake news. Those claims are unproven. Do you ever notice, you read a story and you are reading about massive fraud, but they do not write about that too much. The biggest thing is they do not write But they always say, While this is totally unproven. And you are saying, Well, wait a minute, we caught thousands and hundreds of thousands of people. And then they go, While there is no evidence, they have these little soundbites. But the craziest of them all is and always done in unison because you know, they work together. If this were a business they would be put in jail because it would be called a monopoly. But the biggest and the craziest of the big lie, they call it. You know, what is the big lie? The opposite is the big lie. The election was the big lie. And I have got to tell you, I have got to say this. I have never said it before, but I have always thought it. If I lost the election, I am okay with that. I am okay with it. Seriously. If we lost the election, we lose an election. I will go home. I will start building buildings. I will do something. I will keep myself busy. But you know what? If we lost the election, we know when we lose. In Georgia, they had an election. We did so well. And everyone knew we won by hundreds of thousands and they stole it from us. And what happened is we had two senators running a couple of months later and you know what happened to them? The Republicans said, We are not going out to vote because this is rigged. This election was rigged, and they know it. You know when you win and when you lose. If I lost this election, I could handle it pretty easily. When they steal it from you and rig it, that is not easy. And we have to fight. We have no choice. We have to fight. And it starts right here with the amazing patriots in Arizona. And you are proving the fake news media wrong. You are proving them wrong because the evidence is monumental, just like Russia, Russia, Russia. Remember people would come up to me during the campaign, the first campaign and they said, Sir, you know what I think about Russia? No why do you ask? Just curious. There was these rumors. Another one would come up a month later, Sir, do you have anything to do with Russia? No, I never even thought of it. But after I got asked that question four or five times, I said, What the hell is going on with the Russia? And it was a fake deal made up by Hillary Clinton with a fake dossier where they pay. They play a different game. But you know, ultimately we are much bigger than them. We have many more people because when you go over their policies, the fact is those policies are not a 50% of the vote. We have many, many more people. They are tough, they are mean, and they stick together. They do stick together. But their policies are so bad. They are so pathetic. If they ever had our policies, maybe there'd be no Republican party, I must be honest with you, because we have not until now. And it started with these incredible people, many of whom are sitting right here. The state senators from Arizona, it started with them. And now it is turning out to be a revolution in this country because people are saying, even some Democrats, they are saying no. Knowing what happened in the election is a good thing, not a bad thing. It is a good thing. And what are they trying to hide? Why would not they want it? Now they are trying to hide at That is why I do not understand guys like Ducey and your commissioners. These commissioners, they are so bad. But you know, you have the witch hunt. Remember the great witch hunt and the impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two. And it shows you how the Republicans can really stick together. We have great Republicans. You have Jim Jordan. I am going to get in trouble, but you have Jim Jordan and Devin. And by the way, you have three of them here tonight. These guys I am going to I hope you love them all because those three are fighters. But we will introduce them in a second. They have already probably spoken. I hope they have. That way they will not take up any of our time. But they are great. Here is just some of the shocking information the auditors in Arizona have already reported. So this is reported. This is not coming from ENTITY. This has been reported. More than 74,000. Now I lost by about 10,000. We did not lose. We won by a lot. But they say we lost. So we need more than 10. So here we go. And we have numerous categories, almost all of which are much more than we would need to win the election. And again, remember the word determinative. If I lost by 10 and we found out that there were only two dead people, okay. But there were not . There were thousands and thousands of dead people that voted in different states, thousands and thousands. Some even applied for an application to vote. Do you believe that? So not only did they vote, they applied for an application, but if had two dead people and we lost by 10,000, I do not consider that. I do not . I only talk when it is much more than you need. So think of this. 74,000 mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent. Other than that, it was very good. There is no record of them being sent, but they were counted. So nobody knows where the hell are they, but we counter. The county has refused to disclose how many of these 74,000 were in person, early votes. And how many were magically appearing in a mail-in ballot box near you? How about those boxes? How about those boxes? How about those boxes where they were coming in and Biden was getting 97% of the vote? No, I do not think so. In all fairness, we'd come. We came for rallies here. We had 42,000 and 44,000 and he came and he could not fill the eight circles. They had to use the fake news. No, they were calling the news. Please, would you please stand over here please? They are getting newspaper reporters and reporters to stand there. They are standing with cameras. They could not fill the eight circles. The only thing I liked about his campaign, because he did not really campaign, the cabal campaign. Lots of people campaigned for him. But I did like the- pay for. But I did like the, the contractor, and it was not Hunter Biden with his artistry. Think of that. No, the contractor, those circles were so beautiful the way they were done. I am very good at building buildings and painting and all these different things. So painting, I know what a good paint job is, and you are not getting it from Hunter. But no, no, it was so professionally done. It was incredible. So good. In fact, I probably will not do it yet, but at some point I am going to find out the name of the contractor that did those circles, because I want to use them for some. But what about Hunter Biden getting a half a million dollars per painting, and he never painted before? Could you imagine if my kids did that? Could you imagine? And now they are justifying it. Well, we want to make it non-transparent. No, actually you should make it transparent, I guess. But actually you should not make it real because it is a bribe. It is a bribe, a hundred percent bribe. You have good painters. For $250, you can have a portrait done on Central Park. Guys with pencils. They do so incredible. They are geniuses. They are just geniuses. You go to Central Park, and they have all these artists lined up. You negotiate a deal, they will do it for $250. They are unbelievably talent. Some of them are beyond belief, what they can do in a short period of time. Hunter Biden's getting $500, 000. It is a bribe. It is disgraceful, and the fake news media is talking about it like it is okay, but we should have transparency. It is unbelievable. And the laptop and the laptop, I miss you too. And the laptop from hell, it is a laptop from hell. When you look at that laptop, people are writing about it. Meaning a very tiny group of people are writing. Some books are coming out. Some books by some very good people. But you know what? When you look at the laptop from hell, and then you watch the interview. It was Russia that did his laptop. Then they say, Was it Russia? Well, it may have been me. It may have been them. I think that is the end of that one. It is always Russia. You ever notice? It is never China. Because they are all getting rich from China. They are not getting rich from Russia. It is always Russia, Russia, Russia did it. Russia. Russia did it again. No, it is a disgrace. By the way, I stopped their pipeline. It was stopped. They have a pipeline going into Germany, going into Europe. I stopped it. I put sanctions on all these states and all of these companies who were building it. Biden approved it. Then as you know, you have heard this before he stopped the Keystone XL pipeline. The real number is 48, not eight. They said 8,000, 48,000 jobs. And they lost all over the country. People sold their home. They were so excited that we are going to be building this pipeline. Environmentally much better than a truck. Much better, frankly, than a train, a railroad, much safer. They were building it, and he stopped it like in the first week he stopped it. Yet he approves the biggest pipeline in the world, going from Russia to Germany. And we are supposed to protect Germany. I said that. I said, By the way, you would have never even heard about that pipeline if it was not for me. North Stream two, North Stream. Nobody ever heard of that. Nobody ever talked about it until I came along. Nobody did. Look, I get along with Putin because that is a good thing. I got along with him. He got along with me, but nobody was ever tougher on Russia that I was. This pipeline is the biggest thing they have ever done. This is billions and billions. I asked Angela, and I get along with Angela too, but she is doing what she is doing for Germany. Although I think the pipeline's a big mistake for Germany because they might as well just wave the red flag or the white flag because it is over. It is over. They are going to get 60, 70% of their energy from Russia. So I said, So let me ask you, so we are spending billions of dollars to protect you from Russia. And you are paying billions and billions of dollars for energy to Russia. What the hell is that all about? Right? So I stopped it and within a couple of weeks he approved it, and now they are going to be restarting it. They will have it finished in a couple of months and they are going to make billions and billions of dollars, but the American pipeline is stopped. And I can only say that is called America first versus America last. Look, they are destroying our country. If the election were the way it were, and let us say they were doing a great job, number one, you probably would not be as enthusiastic. Let us say they were doing a great job. By the way, your Arizona border, which I put up the wall. It was great. It was the best it ever was. And now what is pouring into your state is not even to be believed. You know what? If instead of doing the harbor. They are saying it was the worst six months in the history of the presidency. I do not know that that is true, but I would say it is. If you look at what is happened to the economy. How about the vaccine? I came up with the vaccine. They said it would take three to five years, going to save the world. I recommend you take it. But I also believe in your freedoms a hundred percent. But just so you understand, but it was a great achievement. But then, and we started. We are doing a million people a day, and then they said, We are going to put a pause on one of the vaccines. What that did, that set it back so badly. And so now they are saying what a wonderful job he did. They do not say it too much anymore with respect to giving the vaccine. Now it is turning out that they cannot say that anymore. And what they have done is because they do not trust the president, people are not doing it. And that is as simple as it can be. We did such an incredible job with COVID, with getting the gowns, the supplies, the ventilators, the masks, everything, and the press did nothing but kill us. They would say, Look how well India's doing compared to the United States. How is India doing? How is India doing? India is going through hell. They said, Look how well South Korea is doing. They would always try and pick the best country anywhere in the world that had the least problem. Those countries now are being ravaged by this plague that was sent to us by China. And by the way, China has to pay us retribution. All right. There were nearly 4,000 people who voted with a registration date after the cutoff on October 15th. So you have a cutoff, a legal cutoff, but thousands of people voted, and that is illegal. Why did 4,000 people vote? Additionally, there were more than 11,000 individuals who were not on the voter rolls the day after the election. Think of that. They were not on the voter rolls the day after the election. ut who were on the list of voters that was published one month after the election. So they were not there for the election, but a month later they happened to find them, okay? This alone is more than the supposed margin that you needed. It is 10,457 votes. We beat it in every category. There were 18,000 people who voted in Arizona in 2020, who were then purged from the rolls immediately after the election. Why did not they purge them before, Sonny? Could I ask you that question? Sonny said they cheated. They cheated. They cheated. We are becoming like a third world nation, and it is happening. Then 168,000 ballots were found to be printed on unofficial, very thin, flimsy paper. In other words, sounds to me like they were short of ballots, and they just made them up because you have what is called quote Voter secure paper. It is very heavy. It is like the dollar bill. It is very complex stuff. But they did not have that. So they had 168,000 votes and that is required. It is required. You have to have it. And they found it on paper. And the reason they noticed it, I guess, number one, it was very light, but they saw that when you hit it with a certain pen, it went right through the paper. They say, What the kind of papers is this? that is 168,000 votes. And so that also would have been invalidated. They would not have allowed it to be on election day. They would not have allowed it. 168,000 votes. I wonder who they voted for. Tell me, I wonder who they voted for. Would you say it was a hundred percent for Biden or 97%? It was also revealed in a recent hearing that there are thousands and thousands of duplicated ballots that do not have a serial number, suggesting that votes may have been fraudulently duplicated and counted multiple times. Time after time after time. You saw it in Georgia, you saw those people go in. They said, There is a water main break. Everybody leave, everybody leave. Everybody got the hell out. They do not want to drown. They do not want a water main break. And a short while later, a woman, a political operative, we all know her name. We all know her name, and it should have been taken care of, which should have been taken care of. But a woman comes in, but it is now it is in court, and it is a big deal. She came in with a group. She did not go back to her machine. They went for the table. They lifted up the skirt of the table, and lo and behold, it was loaded up with ballots, but they were not ballots that were in boxes that ballots come. They were in other, whether it was suitcases. It was totally different. They took those, and they started putting them in. Sometimes three times, sometimes five times. And they stood there. And I tell you what, when people looked at that they got sick. People threw up looking at it, and law enforcement did very little, but now what is happening is I believe the courts are going to do a lot. It is a big deal going on. That was total criminal behavior. So you hear those hundreds of thousands of votes. We won the state of Arizona, and we won it decisively. And we won other of these states. Is not it amazing? Barack Hussein Obama. He beat Biden all over the country decisively. So did Hillary, except in five swing states where Biden wiped him out with the black population. So I think that he is not going to beat Obama, but only of these states. So he did poorly, except in these states, he had massive victories. We are really smart people. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let this happen. Yet this is only the beginning of the irregularities the Arizona audit is an uncovering. The authors and the auditors have collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers lowered signature matching standards from 20 points of comparison to 10, to five, and eventually down to zero. In other words, they abolished all signature matching entirely. In other words, you have a bad signature. So the machine was picking up a lot of bad signatures. They said, This is no good. Let us lower it. Let us lower it. They brought it down to zero. So you had no signature matching. Perhaps. This is why the county has refused to comply with an official subpoena sent out by your great senate to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they counted ballots and whether or not they had signatures at all. Because we think many of them had no signature at all because you cannot sign them all during the night. We think they did not , and you know what else they did not have? They did not have folds. In order to have a ballot counted, it has to be folded. But so many of these pages are laying flat without a crease, without a fold. Cyber security experts have also testified that the logs for the election management system software were wiped under highly suspicious circumstances. This is them saying it, not me. With more than 37,000 requests made to the server in a single day. Think of that. Erasing the data permanently for the entire period surrounding the election. Gee, I wonder why they erased the data surrounding the election? I wonder why. The county has, for whatever reason, also refused to produce the network routers. We want the routers, Sonny, Wendy, we got to get those routers, please. The routers. Come on, Kelly, we can get those routers. Those routers. You know what? We are so beyond the routers, there is so many fraudulent votes without the routers. But if you got those routers, what that will show, and they do not want to give up the routers. They do not want to give them. They are fighting like hell. Why are these commissioners fighting not to give the routers? How simple could it be? That will tell the truth. What are they trying to hide? Unbelievably, the auditors have testified that the master database for the election management system, sorry to tell you, has been deleted. I wonder why it was deleted. I wonder, Sonny, why was it deleted, please? Meaning the main database for all of the election related data in Maricopa in 2020 has been illegally erased. It is been erased. The county has also refused to provide the authority for the information. We want the information needed to access vote tabulation devices. To top it all off, they have refused to hand over the all-important chain of custody documentation for Maricopa County ballots. They do not want to give it. Why do not they want to give it? Why? I stand before you today to demand nothing less than full and complete cooperation from Maricopa County and from the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors who have fought your senate at every single turn. Incredibly. Why? Why? Why? Why are Republicans fighting it? All they have to do is hand it over, and they are either going to be right. They are not even saying they are right. They just do not want it. They do not even say they are right. I think they know a hell of a lot about what happened, but why do not they want to do that? The citizens of Arizona, an incredible state that as you know, I won four years ago and I won it again. Somebody came in from a media group, a very good media group, actually, said, What was the difference between 2016 and 2020? I said, Well, the difference was I actually did much better in 2020. It is true. We got 75 million votes. We got 12 million votes more. No president in history has ever gotten anywhere close to 12 million more votes. And that is with them doing counting. So you can imagine what the real number is. Okay? Now you can imagine. Because the easiest way of cheating is to throw them away. That is easier. The postmen do not have to deliver them. The post office does not have to deliver them. It is a very Democrat group and why not? They have the greatest pension plan that anybody's ever seen. Why not? And that is okay. But you know, a lot of them did not go to their location and when they were signed, they did not get brought back. But when you think about it, and when you think about the corruptness, why do not these people want to find out the truth? The citizens of America deserve answers. We are talking about America. You know, we are not talking about Arizona anymore. We are talking about the United States of America because this has gone on. And I hate to say it, but this is because you are really bad, but this has gone much worse in Detroit, Michigan, much worse. We have a bunch of RINO senators up there. The exact opposite. You have one or two. We have a whole bunch of them up there, but we have a bunch of RINO senators. This is not as bad anywhere near, in my opinion, as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. You take a look at Philadelphia. What they did to our poll watchers were incredible. We had poll watchers, nice people, great people. They love our country. They were Republican, but more than anything else, they want an honest count. They'd turn them in either way. They were physically thrown the hell out and they could not get in for days. So during that period of time, vast numbers of things happen that are terrible. And not only did they throw them out, they boarded up the windows. So they could not even see inside. Then we got a court order, and they would not obey the court order. And then they kept them 60 feet away. Do you know what 60 feet? That is like me looking at a vote with the lady in the beautiful red dress right over there, right? That is 60 feet. And I am saying, Oh gee, how is that ballot? I am 60 feet away. They were threatened by thugs. In Georgia a a recent review of valid images has shown that the error rate in the hand audit of Atlanta's Fulton County was a whopping 60%. Would you say that is high? Including outright fabricated vote totals as well as obvious duplications of ballots amounting to potentially thousands and thousands of extra votes for Joe Biden. All of this is in addition to the recently discovered 35,000 illegal votes that were potentially cast by people who did not live in the county in which they voted. Minor detail. As well as 100,000 people who were purged from the Georgia rolls after the election. Think of this. I lost by like 11,000. 11,000. They have a 100,00 plus, they were purged. They were deleted after the election was over. Far exceeding the margin needed for a Republican presidential victory. That is just that one item. That is the only one, but we have many. In other words, it is determinative. It is no wonder that Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are going absolutely crazy screaming about voting rights, ranting about democracy. They want democracy and resisting every effort to look into the massive fraud in 2020. Just so you understand, we talk about cancel culture. The biggest thing that they want canceled is they do not want you talking about the election that just took place because they say, Holy shit, they caught us. They caught us. They caught us. We have seen it. It is a scandal, the likes of which we have never had, but the only way you get away with a scandal is if they do not talk about it. They do not want to talk about it. But they are going to have to. If your votes are like people are thinking they are going to be, and when you get up and announce whatever it may be, it is not going to be able. They are not going to be able not to talk about it. The press is so dishonest. They do not want to talk about it. But if you think about cancel. Everything about cancel culture, they want cancel culture. But what they do not want to do is anything having to do with the 2020 election. They almost got away with it. They may have gotten away with it. We are going to find out because something's going to have to be done. But I do not think so. I do not think so. If somebody robs Tiffany, a beautiful jeweler, 57th and Fifth, good location, excellent location. And they steal the diamonds and then they get caught. They have to turn the diamonds back. It is very simple. Amazing the way it works. I only wish that my friend Mike Pence had that additional courage to send the results back to the legislatures because it all happened so quickly. They schemed in this plan for four years, this all happened so quickly. If he would have sent it back to the legislature, somebody gave him bad advice. The great Thomas Jefferson, you know what happened? Georgia, they could not count their votes accurately. Hear ye, hear ye, the great state of Georgia can not accurately count its votes. You know what Thomas Jefferson said? Long time ago, he said, Then we will keep the votes from the great state of Georgia. He did not say, we are going to send it back. I am saying, just send it back. Maybe it comes back. But when you have more votes in some places by a lot than you have voters, I think Mike would have had the right to say, Excuse me, we have more votes than we have voters. If you do not mind, please take a look at it. Just a couple of the basics. Just a little basics. So I wish he did that. I wish he did that. The radical left Democrat communist party rigged and sold the election. And we caught them. The time to hold them responsible and fix this broken and corrupt system is not in 2022 where it may be just as corrupt. And if it is, you are not going to win. Or in 2024, the time is right now here in Arizona. Right now, right now. And you know what? If you do not get down to it and if you do not find, I hate to say this because it is terrible for our country. But you are going to have Republicans that are not going to want to vote. They are not going to want to work for Kelly. They are not going to want to have to work for Wendy and for Borelli, Mister Italy, they are not going to work for you. You know what they are going to say? They are going to say, We are not going to let it happen again. And that is what happened to the two senators. They are not going to work for you. And you got to get going. It is the most important issue. You got to get going. We do not have the luxury to sit back and to wait until the next election. We do not . So many people, and they are such good, I said it before. Sir, think to the future. You are leading in the polls. We just got back from CPAC. I was at 98% approval rating in the poll. 98%. Sonny, what am I here? I do not know. You think we are at 98? I want to find out. I do not know, 98, 98. And they say, Sir, you are leading in the polls, sir. You are way ahead of everybody. Run in '24, sir, you are going to win. And I say, Wait a minute, I just won six months ago. The survival of our nation depends on holding these responsible. And we have to hold these responsible elections. We have to hold those that are responsible for the 2020 presidential elections scam. It was a scam, greatest crime in history, and we have to hold these people accountable. And hopefully, and I say this, and I have confidence in it. Hopefully your Attorney General Mark Brnovich, your state attorney general will take information. This incredible information given by these incredible warriors and patriots. He is going to take it, and he is going to do what everybody knows has to be done. If he does not do that, it would be so sad. And your governor, Doug Ducey, he will be of no help to you. No help to you. It is incredible. He does not want to know the answer. But more is being found out and uncovered every single day. Not only in Arizona, but all over the country. Numbers like you would not believe. Just this month, the former US Attorney for Philadelphia, William McShade. Look, did you ever hear of him? William McSwain, who previously prosecuted much ballot stuffing, many cases in Philadelphia, published a stunning letter. And he did it, I think from the heart, stating that his office received allegations of large scale voter fraud. This is Philadelphia and election irregularities all over Philadelphia. Also one of the most corrupt places from a voter standpoint, another, along with Detroit and some others, one of the most corrupt places, but he found, and he wanted to investigate all of this. But the Attorney General Bill Barr ordered him to stand down, and McSwain was not the only one. And McSwain is very angry about it. Then Bill Barr went out and said there was not fraud in the election of any consequence. Look at the numbers. I am giving you today. Look at the numbers. And we need two large ones or three small ones. We have many, many to look at. But two large ones. In other words, we are right there. So it is of consequence. It is only because sadly, he just did not look for fraud. When that letter came out from McSwain, that was a sad day for this country, sad day. I was wondering because he was all excited. McSwain was all excited. He was going to go in there. Then one day it is like somebody died. he was told not to do it. One day, I noticed that the fake news media was calling Bill Barr, a puppet of ENTITY. And he was not a puppet at all. They had a picture of him with strings where I was totally controlling him. Just not true. They were saying that Bill Barr, you have to go against him, Bill Barr. Then they started saying they were going to impeach him. And they are what is called playing the ref. You know what that is? They are doing it with the Supreme Court too. They are nasty. You see now again, they want to impeach Kavanaugh? Not that they want to impeach him. They want to scare the hell out of him so he votes along the liberal lines because if he votes along the liberal lines, they are playing the ref better than the great Bobby Knight of Indiana ever played the ref. Remember with the chair? The this they said, Bobby, Bobby, you are not going to win that call- Or this, they said, Bobby, Bobby, you are not going to win that call. He said, But I am going to win the next one. That is what they are doing. The great Bobby Knight, who was one of our great endorsements. I will tell you, when Bobby Knight endorsed ENTITY, Indiana, we were doing well there before, you had to see after. Bobby Knight, that is a piece of work, but he said, It may not work this time, but it is going to work the next time. And the refs were afraid to say anything. It is true. That is what they are doing with our Supreme Court. They are trying to scare Kavanaugh. They are talking about an impeachment. I just saw it again this morning in the paper. They want to impeach Kavanaugh again. It is not that they do. They want him to rule for them. And if he rules for them, they are never going to impeach him. But if he rules against them, like he supposed to, because he is a conservative, but they also do not want to have a packed court. So they are saying we are going to pack the courts. We are going to pack the courts. And they did the same thing to Barr. They said, ENTITY controls him. As soon as I saw that, I said, Here we go, because how does he get out of that? Very simply, just do things like the vote was not rigged. And he stopped them from doing it. And I am so saddened by it. But I also understand it because nobody does it better than these crooked Democrats. Nobody does it better. So I do not blame Barr. I do not blame a lot of people, but they become weak and they become ineffective and they become frightened. Like it or not, we are becoming a communist country. That is what is happening. That is what is happening. We are beyond socialism. When you have no press that you can talk to, that is how a communist country begins. They have no press. We find things in Arizona, and other than a couple of great networks, we have no press. We have no voice. I only have voice because I get great ratings. Ultimately ratings are very important. But even those lights, they still have those lights going. That is good. I am very impressed. That is good. Thank you. And if the Democrats get some of the things they currently want passed, including the election of Corrupt Politicians Act, an infrastructure, which is not infrastructure, it will get even worse. What they are asking for is incredible. The Green New Deal, going to destroy our country, this Green New Deal. It is green new bullshit. That is what it is. It is bullshit. No more windows in buildings because environment. I always did great with these buildings that the bigger the window, the better I did, the bigger those windows, I wanted floor to ceiling windows, but they say you cannot do that anymore. We do not want any more windows. It is going to be real hard to sell apartments, I think. We have a beautiful apartment, and for environmental reasons, we have not put windows in the building. Oh great. Well, that sounds good. These people are crazy. Whatever happened to cows, remember they were going to get rid of all the cows? They stopped that, people did not like that. Remember? You know why they were going to get rid of all the cows? People will be next. People will be in there. Sadly, even in many red states, the rhinos are letting the radical left have their way on everything. In fact, I have to say this, in many cases, these weak Republicans or rhinos, these weak Republicans are worse. They are worse than Democrats. And you have a couple of examples right here in Arizona and do not nod. And do not say it because I do not want to get you in trouble. Maybe you can convince them to do what is right. But you have a couple of them right here in Arizona and nobody knows. And I will tell you what, they are going to be defeated as sure as you are sitting there, they are going to be defeated in the primaries by real Republicans. And it is not so far off. You have secretaries of state certified election results that were highly inaccurate. And even fraudulent they are certifying elections where the numbers are fraudulent. You have poll watches, as I said, who were illegally blocked from vote counting in Philadelphia, Detroit, and many, many other cities. In certain areas, there were more votes than there were voters. Think of that one. That was so easy. You say all these different things. A lot of people talking about the machines, I say, you know what? Too complex, you do not need them. It is so many different forms. They cheated in so many different ways. You do not have to get complex. You do not have to be a great scientist from MIT. They cheated in so many different ways. People were caught on camera illegally running ballots multiple times through voting counting machines. And remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I am the one trying to save American democracy. I am trying to save it. Our country is being destroyed by people who have no right to destroy it. People that won an election illegally. People that should not have been elected. They lost in a landslide. Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are wrecking our nation. I do not even believe it is him. I honestly do not believe. I do not think Joe knows where the hell he is. I do not think it is him. Crime is surging. Inflation is soaring. The border is gone. We went from the strongest border ever to the weakest border ever. The border is non-existent. Illegal aliens are pouring in, in record numbers. Critical race theory is being forced into every facet of our society. Free speech is being crushed. Men are being allowed to compete in women's sports. How do you like that? Think of that. How fair is it? Did you see the weightlifter? I hate to tell you this women, but he shattered your longstanding record. This guy gets up boom, boom, like a nine year record, sonny, a nine year record. Boom. Did he do it with one hand? It is so unfair. It is so unfair. So ridiculous. I will be honest though, look, we all like to win. If I were a coach, I will tell ya. I would not be talking to too many women as we know women. I'd be getting some of these people that they are women. Somebody said that if LeBron James ever decided to get the operation, how would he be? How would he be on the court? And by the way, LeBron James, you can have him. Did you see the basketball ratings, which were terrible. But they went up after his team was defeated and that is happening. It is in sports and people do not want to see it. They want to see athletes. They want to see competition. But the last thing they want to see is men competing in women's sports. Because very soon, you are not going to have women competing anymore. I hate to say it. I hate to say, you are going to have a coach have a full team. And that team is going to win the national championship so easily, you are not going to have women competing. They are taking away your rights. That is really a women's rights movement. You cannot let that happen. And now they just allowed it to happen in the Olympics. The Olympics has gone bad too. Our infrastructure is being hacked by foreign countries left and right. Thousands of rockets are being fired at Israel. And Joe Biden is allowing America to be pushed around and laughed at all over the world. This did not happen when I was president. This did not happen when I was president. In addition to all of our work, to hold Democrats accountable for their election fraud, which is massive, we must fight harder than ever before to win a colossal victory for America first Republicans, next year we have to, but again, you have to solve this problem. We are going to work our asses off. But you have to solve this problem. Have to solve this problem. We must reclaim the House. We must reclaim the Senate. State legislatures all over. We did so well last election. And governor's mansions all across the nation. Last year, Republicans made massive gains. I got no credit from these people. None. I made 58 phone calls, 58. They are called teleconference calls. Everybody I made it to did so great. I was responsible for getting these people elected. In the House, we were expected to lose 25 to 35 seats. And instead of losing 25 to 35 seats, we lost for the first time in many decades, zero seats. And in fact, we shockingly gained 16 seats. And in the Senate, without my involvement, it would right now be 60/40 with the Democrats in the lead. Nobody likes to talk about that. We had such an incredible evening in the election. We did so well in the election. They like to say, I will tell you, you had a gentleman here, a legislator here who said Thank you. And I love you too. He said, Sir, I was prepared to lose my election, people that you know. I did not know him. I spoke to him for the first time. He said, I was prepared to lose my election. Two months before, I was prepared. Then I went to one of your rallies. And I saw the level of enthusiasm with thousands of people unable to get in. 42,000 people, thousands unable to get in. I saw the enthusiasm, but I was very much prepared. I assumed I was going to lose. He has been there for a long time. Then he said, And then the night before the election, I walked outside with my wife. And there were all these ENTITY signs, ENTITY, ENTITY, all over the place. Elect ENTITY, ENTITY Pence. They had ENTITY Pence and ENTITY, but they had all of these signs and they had the American flag and everybody was going wild. I said 'Darling, I think I am going to win the election.' And the next day, sir, I won the election and I won my district by a lot. And you lost my district. And there was no way that I got more votes than you. You got far more votes than I did, sir. There is no way possible. And I said to my wife, 'This election is rigged.' And what the fake news goes around saying is the reason we did so well in legislatures, the reason we did so well in Congress with not any loss, but all of these gains, I guess it was 16. All of these gains and the Senate, we did very well. Even though Mitch McConnell should not have said, We will not give 25 cents more than $600. And the other side said, We will give you 2000. Like it or not, that is not good politics. And frankly, they were going to get it anyway. It was a disastrous thing. He did ads where he was in the ad and he is not a popular guy. So we should have won those seats. But if you just forget those two seats, we would have been 60/40. And what they try and do is say, Well, the reason we won all Did not we win every legislature in the country? The reason we won is because the legislators were far more popular than ENTITY. No, it is not that, that is why I tell you that rather long story, because we carried them in, but they did not give me and the presidency, they did not give us the votes. That is all it is. It is very simple. And they are liars and they are scoundrels. And they are very bad and very dishonest, but that is just the way it is. Right here in Arizona, we must fire one of the most extreme leftists in Congress, your radical Democrat Senator Mark Kelly. And it is not that he is leftist. It is that he does not care about the border. With all the time I spent winning the legal stuff, I think we had 11 lawsuits, we won them all, and then I could start. It would have been so much easier, but I never heard from him. He never said, How can I help? He could not care less about your border and your border in Arizona is one big We did such a great job, but he did absolutely nothing. Kelly has done nothing to protect your state. And if you look at the Biden border crisis and it is beyond a crisis, they are saying, Oh, do not use the word crisis. Well, now that is like a nice word. He is completely owned and controlled by Pelosi and Schumer. And the open border is left. Now, the socialist Democrats and communists are trying to include amnesty in their reconciliation bill, which would turbocharge the crisis and neither Mark Kelly, nor anybody on the democratic side They are all fake moderates. They are fake. They say they do not say a word about it. If this change is not made soon, Arizona will never be able to recover from what is happening. You are getting it worse than most because you are on the border. So big on the border. Taking back america begins with kicking Mark Kelly the hell out of the United States Senate. With us today are a few of the Republican candidates running to beat Mark Kelly next year. And maybe if you are around, stand up. Blake Masters, where is Blake? Blake, thank you. Thank you, Blake, good, you are doing well. Jim Lehman, Jim. Thank you, Jim. Great job. Thank you, Jim. General Mick McGuire. General, thank you very much. Thank you, General. Also with us, are Arizona's gubernatorial candidates, Matt Salmon. Hi Matt. Kari Lake. Whoa. Wow. This could be a big night for you. Thank you very much, Kari. Good job. Steve Gaynor. Steve. Thank you, Steve. And state treasurer Kimberly Yee. Thank you, Kimberley. I have to tell you, maybe the most pleasure I will get out of any introductions tonight because these guys are warriors. They are warriors. They love your state. They love this country. We are thrilled to be joined by several of our really best people in Congress. They happen to reside in a place called Arizona. First of all, Andy Biggs, where is Andy? Warrior. You are so lucky to have these three guys. There are no games with these three guys. Paul Gosar, Paul. Paul. Incredible. And a woman that I have fallen in love with and the first lady is very upset about it. She is incredible. What she did during the impeachment, especially the impeachment hoax number one, she made a name for herself. She did not do it for herself. She did it for this country. Debbie Lesko, Debbie. Great. Debbie. Those are three great people. I actually said, Do we have our stars? Yes, sir. They here. They would not miss it. But I appreciate it. You really are. You are warriors and you love this country. Thank you. When we win giant Republican victories and reclaim control over Congress and really reclaim it over our country, we will halt the radical Biden agenda in its tracks. By the way, remember, I used to say, it is going to be worse? It is not him. I really do not believe. But remember I used to say it was going to be worse? Bernie Sanders can not believe what is happening. He is the happiest guy, he said, I never knew this was going to happen. Is that right, Paul? He said, I never knew this was going to happen. He cannot believe it. This is so much more radical. They never talked about this. They never talked about closing up the pipeline the following day. He talked about, We are going to study it. We are going to look at it. No, he did that, got some votes and he closed it. And how about the union on the Keystone pipeline? How about the union where they endorsed Biden? And I said, You know you are going to get screwed, but they have always been with Democrats, but you know what? The voters are with me. The voters are with me and the workers. The workers are with me and with us, we will stop the federal takeover of elections and stop the Democrat attack on voter ID. Did you see the disinformation campaign? So they do a poll the other day and it showed voter ID, Andy, is it 88%, including Democrats, it is 88%. Everybody wants voter ID. Who does not want it? You go to the grocery store, you give a picture, do anything you do. You give a picture. Voter ID is at 88%. So here is their line, all of a sudden, we do not want a voter ID. Then one day they pass it on and the press plays along. We have always wanted voter ID. We have always wanted it. It is the Republicans who do not want it. Think of this. And they had the same thing with defund the police. We want to defund the police. We will defund the police. Now crime is at the highest it is ever been in history. These police departments have been devastated. They have treated our great law enforcement, I just met a lot of them backstage, so badly with so little respect, but it is a very unpopular thing. They did not know that. Who the hell would not know that? Defund the police. I am telling you, they have got advantages, but they are dumb in a lot of ways, their policy is so bad. So now they are saying, you guys see that, It was the Republicans that wanted to defund the police. It is just like Russia, Russia, Russia. They make up stuff. I watched that shifty shift go up to the microphone. It is extremely important to save our country. ENTITY is a paid employee of Russia. It is unbelievable. And you know what they say, if they say it over and over and over again, in a year from now, a lot of people are not going to remember who wanted to defend the police and who did it. And they are not going to remember about voter ID, Andy. And we got to be careful with that. Paul, we got to be careful with that. Debbie, you are not going to let that happen. You are not going to let it, but that is what they do. And you know what it is called? Disinformation. They make up a lot of crap and they say it over and over and over. And one day you say, Oh, who was the one that wanted to defund? I guess it was the Republicans. The Republicans are against a very serious and a very sick enemy. We will end Joe Biden's war on American energy and ensure that the United States remains the dominant energy superpower on earth. Can you imagine they are out negotiated with OPEC again? We did not need OPEC. That is why I was taking everybody out of the Middle East because we needed the Middle East for oil. Now we need the Middle East for oil again. We will break up the big tech monopolies. And we will immediately shut down Joe Biden's border disaster. And we are going to end, by the way, catch and release. I ended catch and release. You know what it is? You catch a criminal and you take his name or whoever, you take his name, her name, and you release them into our country. You release them. We did something slightly better. Stay in Mexico. We have stayed in Mexico. And we will restore our southern border. We want to remain, let them remain in Mexico. The people, they are all over the United States, your border, and you are getting hit hard, probably harder, much harder, but all over the country, you can go to Iowa. You can go to all over the country. They are being hit and it is a crime wave. Big crime wave is coming out of it. Go all over the country. And you will see you are being hit. Right here in Arizona, Joe Biden has utterly demolished your border and cynically betrayed the people of the state because he never said he was going to do that. I told you he would. In May alone, border patrol encountered 540% more illegal migrants in the Tucson sector and 1500% more in Yuma than the same period when I was Think of that, 1500% more in one year. Now that does not mean as much as this for everyone you catch,, I think 10 come in. Some people say it is five or six. Let us say it is 10. You are talking about millions of people are coming into our country. We expedited removals and deported criminal aliens by the thousands. We took out MS-13 gang members by the tens of thousands, we got them out. Thousands and thousands of these absolute killers. And we built nearly 500 miles of beautiful border wall. The same wall that they wanted. I went with them. I said, I do not want the anti-climb paddle on top. You know the paddle on top that you see? I said, I do not like it. I do not want it. They said, Sir, it is anti-climb. I said, Oh, in that case, I like it. And they got to paint the wall, by the way, it sounds not so nice at a speech. How can Churchill make a great speech and say you got to paint the wall? It is pretty basic. Remember what I used to say? There were two things that will never get obsolete. Everything's obsolete. You have a new computer, three days later, you read it is obsolete. Two things. What are the two things? The wheel and the wall. We achieved the most secure border in US history. Biden's open border policies have blown it all up in shreds so fast. And they have enriched the drug cartels, the child smugglers, the woman's smugglers, and the vicious MS-13 gang members. They are making more money with human trafficking now and drugs, the sale of drugs, we had fentanyl down to the lowest it is been in 15 years because it is not just people. It is the drugs that come across. We had it to the lowest. This drug is a killer. A small amount can kill a thousand people. A little amount can kill thousands of people. We had it to the lowest level it is been in 15 years and it was going down and now he blew the thing up. And I used to say, it is incompetence, but they must really want this to happen. Why would not they have finished the wall? It would have taken two months. What are they doing? What are they doing? This is not just a national security crisis. It is truly a humanitarian catastrophe. Last month alone, the remains of 43 people were tragically discovered along the Arizona border. Just your border. Nearly 100 migrant children were found stranded in the sweltering, Arizona desert, having been cruelly enticed to the United States by Biden's rhetoric. He said, Come in everybody, come in. And they heard that and they all started walking up and I said, You cannot come in. You will be stopped. And we have 28,000 Mexican soldiers that are there. I said to the president of Mexico, who I like a lot, and he actually likes me. He is from a different persuasion. He is a socialist, but he is a great gentleman. And I said, Mr. President, you are going to have to stop them because we are building the wall and they are coming in. And I worked out a deal. I said, I will not put tariffs on the thousands and thousands of cars you send over on a daily basis, but you have to put 28,000 soldiers on our border free of charge. And he said, I will do that. Now they are gone. And now they are all gone. And those soldiers knew what they were doing. I will be honest with you, there were no games. There were no games. We did a great job during the construction of the wall. Once the wall was up, you did not need them, but you have to finish the level empty areas of the wall. The flood of illegal immigrants is also placing a crushing burden on communities across the state and throughout the nation, depleting your already overcrowded schools and hospitals and public services of critical resources, you know that. They are so crowded now because there're so many people, many of them cannot speak English. The whole thing is a catastrophe. Your kids are saying, What the hell is going on? Even before the Biden border crisis, Arizona taxpayers were spending a staggering $2.3 billion a year to pay for the welfare education justice system, course and illegal immigration, $1,000 per Arizona household every year. And that is now going to be doubled and tripled. In our movement, we believe that your taxpayer dollars should go to support truly needing Americans. You have to take care of American citizens. And look, we all have a heart. I see the same thing as you do, and we want to help people. But when you say, Come up, come up, come to America, our country cannot afford it. Our system is breaking down. We cannot afford it. You just cannot afford it. The whole world. This is in Mexico and Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador. They are coming in from Yemen. They are coming in from all over the Middle East. They are coming in from Haiti. Large numbers are coming in from Haiti. They are coming in from all parts of Africa. numbers are coming in from Haiti. They are coming in from all parts of Africa. They are coming in from Europe, they are coming in from all over the world. And our country's not, no country is set for that. Number one, you cannot afford it. Number two, on a human basis and even on a common sense basis, it is going to destroy it. They are destroying our country. They are destroying our country. Under my Administration, America was respected again and respected like never before. We withdrew from the United Nations corrupt We withdrew from the United Nations corrupt Human Rights Council. So corrupt, which seemingly existed to criticize Israel and the United States. That is all they did was criticize us. But not only is Joe Biden, reentered the shameful and ridiculous international tribunal, but just this month you saw this, the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, sent them a pandering and very, very strange letter begging to United Nations to come and investigate America for its alleged systematic racism. So you have systemic racism. He says he wants it to be investigated. Systemic racism. I said, That did not happen. Did it? I thought there is nothing, it is a joke about it. But I said, That is not serious, right? Systemic racism, please come and investigate the United States. The Biden Administration's action is an outrageous insult to the American people and to our country. The United States of America is the most just and virtuous nation in the world in the history of the world. And I will tell you, you are not going to have a country very much longer. You are not going to have a country. Always I talk about, we can do this, we can do that. Three and a half years is a long time. Two years is all they need. They are going to knock out the filibuster, you watch. I used to tell Mitch McConnell, you know what? You better knock out the filibuster and get everything approved, because they are going to do it. They will never do that, sir. Why will not they do it? Because it is bad for America. Do you think they care about America? They do not care. And the first day they announced that they are going to knock the hell out of it, you watch. The two senators are going to do a folder, and you are going to have a big problem, especially in light of all of the disasters that Biden has caused. We should not be apologizing to the world. We are apologizing for America, just like Obama apologized. Remember, he apologized. They should be apologizing to America for what they have done to it. That is who I think should be apologizing to. The Biden Administrations, America last philosophy because it is America last. It is America last. That is all it is, is also making a mockery of our country right here at home. Earlier this year, Biden signed an executive order pushing toxic, Critical Race Theory into our children's schools and into our military. How about our military? This poisonous left wing doctrine is flagrant racism, plain and simple. And it has no place in our schools, no place in our military and no place in our country. You remember, I ended it very rapidly with a very powerful executive order, but that executive order was immediately repealed and terminated by the radical left. A Republican Congress will defund it and ban it once and for all. They are going to ban it. They will get it done. In testimony before Congress, lightweight Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, actually defended the teaching of CRT, a Marxist ideology, to our men and women in uniform. Can you believe it? These soldiers, they are the greatest. They are hearing this stuff, they are saying, I cannot believe what I am hearing. The soldiers are saying it. He said he wanted to quote, understand white rage. He wants to understand white rage. What the hell is he talking about that for? Our generals should not be focused on learning left wing ideology. They should be focused on defeating America's enemies and winning our future wars. Hopefully we do not have them, but if we do, we have to win them. And I say it, and I will say it, whatever. The only reason I appointed Mark Milley in the first place is because two of the world's most overrated generals, James Mattis and John Kelly could not stand him, had no respect for him and would not recommend him under any circumstances. They even tried to send him to Europe so he would not get the job. So when they did not like him, I said, Let us give this guy a shot. Last summer, when rioters were threatening to destroy Washington, DC, Milley practically begged me not to send in the military to stop the destruction. I was thinking about it. It is a big step to do it. Insurrection Act, big step to do it, but I was getting close, but he did not want to do it. He did not want to do that. Why would we ever want to do a thing like that? After walking, and I did plenty, I signed a executive order on statues. You knock down any of us statues, you go to jail for 10 years and it all stopped. It was a miracle. Right, Andy? It all stopped. Paul, that was great. We stopped it. When they were pulling down statues and then it got crazy. They start pulling down statues of Abraham Lincoln. It would have never stopped, but I signed that order. And as soon as I signed that order, not one event took place. You get 10 years for even attempting to take it down. All stopped, amazing. It is amazing. After walking with me to the smoldering church, they tried to burn the church down the day before, the smoke was still coming out of it. Milley issued a groveling apology because he caved to the press. He was afraid of the press. And it was really in order to take off the pressure again, is what they do to these people is they come after them through the media, through every way they can. And they end up being weak people. All he had to do was say that I am proud to walk with anyone representing the President of the United States, and people would have understood that. He apologized. And that was the end of him when he did that apology, that was the end of him, nothing to do with me. It is the office that counts. As the radicalization campaign in our military illustrates. We are seeing almost every major institution in American life be taken over and weaponized by the extreme left, including law enforcement, the military, the corporate media. These people here just, you know, it is just I hope they are , more than anybody in this room, I hope they are listening because they are destroying our country. And especially the big tech companies, which are engaged in illegal censorship of the American people. It is a first step to restoring free speech in our country. This month, as you probably read, I filed a major class action lawsuit suit against big tech . If you want to join, you can. We are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google in Federal Court. And we will keep on fighting until we have reclaimed the sacred right of freedom of speech for every single citizen of this nation. What they do to the conservative voice, and again, they say private, but they have Section 230, which basically gives them immunity, that gives them no problems at all. We do not need lawyers. So once they do that, they have a right that nobody, Section 230, that no other company has anywhere in this country, so that no longer puts them in that category. And we can go after them and let us see what happens. But far worse than even big tech is the lame stream media, which is no longer free. And with few exceptions is totally corrupt and is truly the enemy of the people. That is all that you can say. You know that. And maybe I see it better because we can give them a statement that is so accurate and so proven. And then they write it the opposite. Whereas if you are a carpenter, you are an electrician, you are a worker, you are a lawyer, whatever you might do, you do not know that. You just think that what you are reading, they have the lowest rating right now, approval rating, in history, in the history of the rating business. They have their lowest rating, because people have gotten wise to them. And I think it is something that in terms of legacy, I am very proud of what we have been able to do. I am very proud of it. Nobody had any idea the level of deception and corruptness. The media does not report the news anymore. They only report bad things about us and make it worse. They report bad things and they make it worse and good things about them and they make it much better. And they make it much better. If there is anything bad about the other side, they never want to talk about it. Look at Hunter Biden. They do not want to, you do not see it. They do not want to talk about it. Can you imagine if that were a Republican, if that were a conservative in some high level? As an example, the network nightly newscasts hardly ever discuss the crime rate, which is at an all time high. The disaster taking place at the border or Joe Biden's very slow vaccine rollout is very slow, very slow. They actually tried to take credit for the vaccine and that did not work out too well. They do not blame Biden for anything, including the fact that the virus is making an unexpected comeback and ravaging countries throughout the world. Only in a short time ago, it looked like it was going to be good, but nobody says it is Biden, does anybody say it is Biden's fault? And I am not even blaming him, but does anybody say it? Because the job we did was so incredible. That is why we are in the position we are in today. So incredible. And that is all they wanted to talk about. They wanted to demean and it was a disgrace. The radical left is determined to ruin everything in America. That is what they are doing. Woke politics takes the life and joy out of everything. Woke-ism makes you lose, ruins your mind and ruins you as a person. You become warped. You become demented. The US Women's Soccer team is a very good example of what is going on. Earlier this week, they unexpectedly lost to Sweden, three to nothing, and Americans were happy about it. You proved that point before I even said it. Now the left is in the process of destroying our national pastime, baseball. First, we saw the embarrassing spectacle of the Commissioner of baseball, bowing to the radical left on voter fraud. You saw what they did. You saw they moved the All-Star game. Now one of the most beloved and storied franchises in baseball, all of baseball, I watched it as a kid at Yankee Stadium. The Cleveland Indians will be changing their name, a name that was filled with history and memories. The new name will be the Cleveland Guardians, which is terrible. The Cleveland Indians, if I were an Indian I'd sue. Sue them, Indians. I mean, what could be better? Especially if you have a good team, the Cleveland Indians, it is one of the greatest names. One of the most incredible logos. People love it. They are going absolutely crazy in Ohio over the name change. The Cleveland Guardians, what is that all about? The insanity of the left knows no bounds. And both Indians and baseball fan should be greatly insulted. They want to take away our history, our heritage, our culture, and everything that holds us together. By the way, remember when Bill Clinton was in Arizona, do you remember that? It was about 125 degrees out, sorry to bring that up. And he has a bad heart. And he said he was playing golf, but actually he was meeting on an airplane with the Attorney General discussing Hillary. I wonder what they were discussing. Remember he said, No, no. I was only there, I was only there to discuss my grandchildren and golf. Remember that? He said he was out there to play golf, but it was about 121 degrees that day, which is a little hot. What is happening to our country has sadly happened to so many others. We are at the beginning of a communist system. Radicals are seizing power and destroying everything we hold dear as Americans and it is happening. And I said it was going to happen. They dismantle the rule of law, censor speech, take over the free press, imprison political opponents. You see that is happening all over. Look at what I have been through for years. And of course, hold fake, phony elections. It was recently revealed that during the hand recount in Fulton County, Joe Biden had batches of ballots go for him. 100 for Biden, nothing for ENTITY. I got nothing. I got nothing. Give me one vote. One vote. Even Fidel Castro only got 99%. Okay. So many of our state and local offices have been overtaken by corruption. The radical left install partisan Democrat prosecutors who are not interested in equal justice, but political justice. It is happening at a level that we have not seen this happen in many, many years. They would wield law enforcement against political opponents, inventing that never had been prosecuted before, while murderers and criminals walk free without prosecution at all, all over the streets of our cities in particular. They have turned our cities into Banana Republics where the innocent are persecuted while crime soars. Just look at what they have done in New York city. Innocent people are beaten in the streets daily. People are shot in Times Square. Rapes and murders are totally out of control. And yet what are the leftists and the attorney general and district attorney's offices working on so diligently? This is what they are working on so diligently and with such passion, it is get ENTITY. They campaign on getting ENTITY. Their campaign, we are going to get ENTITY. We are going to take down ENTITY. They do not talk about the murderers. They do not talk about no cash bail. They do not talk about all these dangerous people walking the streets so people are afraid to come to New York. They are still coming after me because I will never stop fighting and winning for you. Going through it for five years, five years. From the very beginning of our movement, we have been fighting against some of the most corrupt, powerful and entrenched forces imaginable. The professional political class, the deep state, the fake news media, the Russia hoaxers, the globalists, the socialists, the communists, the lobbyists, the corporate special interests who are absolutely terrible. And now the Critical Race Theorists, all of them oppose our movement for a simple reason. We believe in putting America first. It is very simple. We believe in strong families, strong borders and strong sovereign nations. We believe in fair trade for the American worker. Look at what we did with the worst trade deal in the history of the world, NAFTA. Now we have the USMCA, and Mexico and Canada are not thrilled. That is a good sign by the way, but it is a great deal for us. And the stiff tariffs that I put on communist China, I tell you what, all they wanted to do is not have me put on tariffs. We were getting along absolutely great until COVID came. The China virus came, we were getting along great. We are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China in tariffs and what was happening, our farmers with the trade deal that I made with China were doing phenomenal. They are doing now phenomenally because China is buying numbers that nobody's ever seen before, corn and soybeans, everything they are buying. But you know what? Once the virus came in, I did not even talk about that trade deal. It meant nothing to me. It meant nothing to me. So sad for what is happened to our country. So said what happened to the world. So many people are dead and so seriously injured, and they are going to have to pay. We believe in low taxes, low regulations, unleashing American energy independence, and putting, we have to have independence with our energy. Think of what they are doing. Think of what they are doing. Look at what is happening at the pump. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. It is going up at a record pace, and you are going to be at $7 or $8 or $9 a gallon, and putting American jobs before the interests of foreign corporations. We believe in ending the endless foreign wars, rebuilding our military, supporting our warriors, taking care of our great veterans and bringing our troops back home, where they belong. Where they belong. And as you know, I started the move out of Afghanistan. I think it was impossible for him to stop it, but it was a much different deal. I told the Taliban, I spoke to the leader and I spoke. I said, let us call him Muhammad. I said, Muhammad, we are leaving and we are going to get along. But just in case, for any reason you decide to do something terrible to our country or beyond what is normal, because they have been fighting for a thousand years, in your country, we are going to come back and we are going to hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And I told him that. This was a telephone conversation, had a number of them. I said, We are going to get along great, but I just have to make that statement. We are going to hit you harder than any country. And he is a rough guy. This guy has been fighting from the time he is two years old. That is what they do. They fight. That is what they do. They fight. Russia did very poorly against them. Russia is Russia now, not the Soviet Union because of Afghanistan. Afghanistan. So they fight. I said, We are going to come back and hit you harder. Do you understand? He goes, Huh? He is a rough guy. I started off the conversation. I said, Muhammad, how are you? ENTITY. Uh. Not a lot of social grace, but he was being nice. I think he was being as nice as he could be, Andy, but they are rough. That is all they do is fight. But I said, We are going to come back and hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And your village, where I know you are and where you have everybody, that is going to be the point at which the first bomb is dropped I told him that, I told him. And he said to me, and I think he actually meant it. He said to me, I understand. I understand. And I believe beyond a deal, I believe we had a real understanding. And then we had the election rigged and stolen, and now they are going wild over there. That would not have happened if I were President, would not have happened. Too bad. Too bad. We believe in patriotic education for our children. And we strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America's youth. We are not going to let it happen. We are committed to defending innocent life, protecting our constitution, and to proudly upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our nation's founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctness. We do not like political correctness. And we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture. We believe in law and order, and we respect and support the men and women of law enforcement, and above all we live by the words of our national motto and it will never ever change, In God We Trust. Sustained by these timeless American values and powered by the strength of these unstoppable ideas, we will press forward. We will have victory after victory. Never forget the heart, soul, brilliance, passion and patriotism of the young people here today. They are young, great people. And Charlie, I want to thank you. What a joy you have done, what a job you have done. And to the devoted citizens all across our country, is so much greater than our opponents can even imagine. We are there. We have massive majorities and we are much stronger than them, much stronger than them. We are much stronger than they are, because unlike their agenda, our movement is not driven by the lust for control and domination of others. Our movement is driven by a love for America and an ironclad faith in the American people. I have that faith and you have that faith. We are not fighting for socialism, communism. We are not fighting for servitude. We are fighting for God, for country and we are fighting for freedom. We know in our veins that our American inheritance was passed down to us by generations of patriots who gave everything they had, their sweat, their blood, and even their very lives to build America into the most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are not going to let it be taken away from us by a small group of radical left, Marxist maniacs. So my fellow Americans, our movement is the greatest in American history. There has never been a movement like we have had. We won the most important election, 2016. We did more than any other administration has ever done. And we did it quickly. We are not going to let it be taken away from us. The 2022 midterms are the next phase of the battle and we will not stop there. We will keep on going until we have made America great again. With your help, we will take back the House. We will take back the Senate and we will take back that beautiful, gorgeous White House. And we will take back our country. So working together, we will make America powerful again. Thank you. Thank you. The whole country is watching, the whole country is watching what you have done. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you to Turning Point. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumpphoenixarizonarallyspeechtranscriptjuly24", "title": "Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Rally Speech Transcript July 24", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-rally-speech-transcript-july-24", "publication_date": "24-07-2021", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 614, "text": "Thank you, Dean Kleckner, and thank you all. And welcome to the White House. On Monday I met with the congressional leadership to discuss the drought that has afflicted so many thousands of acres of our farmland and that has already touched so many Americans' lives. Tomorrow I will be flying out to Illinois and Iowa to see the effects of the drought for myself. But when I heard that you were going to be here in Washington, I decided to take this day to meet with you, you who are in so many ways the leaders of American agriculture. First, let me say our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are necessary to protect America's farmers from excessive losses during this drought. Already we have taken a number of actions. We have formed an interagency drought policy committee to coordinate Federal action. The Army Corps of Engineers is working hard to keep traffic moving on the Mississippi River and elsewhere in spite of some of the lowest water levels in history. And in order to help livestock owners, Secretary Lyng has permitted grazing on set-aside lands. But needless to say, much more needs to be done. And now is the time to start work on legislation to help the many crop farmers who will suffer substantial losses. At my direction, Secretary Lyng has been working closely with the leadership of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees in an effort to draft timely legislation. We have sought to make this a bipartisan effort, and so far I am pleased by the cooperation that we have received. Permit me to outline the five points we are seeking in this drought legislation. First, relief should go to those who need it most. Creating windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving. Second, many of our farmers purchased Federal crop insurance, a sound business decision. They should not be penalized relative to farmers who-did not act with such prudence. Third, this legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable things. No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops. Fourth, drought relief spending has to be considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the Federal deficit; and according to the November 1987 bipartisan budget agreement that we reached with Congress, to put it very simply, we mustn't bust the budget. The automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending triggers would take back from farmers with one hand what we are providing in drought relief with the other. And finally, this humanitarian assistance should not be used as a means to other ends. Extraneous matters, such as rewriting the existing farm bill, will only deter our efforts to provide this much-needed aid. Now permit me to tell you just where our efforts stand. Yesterday, after long consultations with Secretary Lyng, bipartisan legislation that meets these goals was introduced in both the House and Senate. Secretary Lyng will continue to work with the House and Senate Agriculture Committees as they mark up the drought relief package to ensure that this bipartisan, bicameral cooperation continues. And yet, even as the drought continues, we would do well to look beyond it to the long-range future of American agriculture. We all know that American farmers are more than competitive in world markets-if only those world markets give our farmers the chance to compete fairly. And this is why, under Secretary Lyng and Ambassador Clayton Yeutters guidance, we are working to increase our agricultural exports by making world trade freer and much more fair. Last July we presented at the Uruguay round in Geneva a proposal that I described as-and by the way, that is one of the best parts of this job is that from time to time you get to quote yourself but I described our proposal as the most ambitious proposal for world agricultural trade ever offered. Our proposal calls for nothing less than a total phaseout by the year 2000 of all policies that distort trade in agriculture. This proposal reflects one of my abiding beliefs; I think it is a belief that you share: The solution to the world agricultural problem is to get government out of the way and let farmers compete. It is true, of course, that getting rid of all export subsidies, import barriers, and the like-all the things that make it harder for our farmers to compete in world markets-is a very tall order; but we are not backing down. At the economic summit in Toronto last month, we were able to persuade the heads of state that, at the Montreal midterm review meeting, their trade ministers must reach agreement on a goal and a timetable for completing the Uruguay round. And I can tell you after nearly 8 years of working with these heads of state, setting a deadline, a time when the talking has to stop and the action has to begin, is a very powerful instrument for getting things done. I know that you support our agricultural proposal for freer and fairer world markets. And I thank you for that support, just as I give you my heartfelt thanks for your support on a host of other things, including the textile bill and the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. And I ask you to continue to work to help the farmers who're suffering as a result of the drought. The productivity of American agriculture is one of the great success stories of our time, indeed, of all time. As recently as 1940, a single American farmer could feed 19 people for a year. Today a single American farmer feeds about 120 people for a year, and American products are shipped around the world. Through all these decades, despite drought and misfortune, the American farmer has continued to succeed. We will get over this drought. And, yes, we will succeed in making world markets fairer and more open. And the American farmer will continue to go from strength to strength. You know, tomorrow, when I meet with a group of those farmers right out there in the heart of the drought-I am thinking, you know, it never is very successful in saying-Did you ever hear the funny thing I said? So, I do not usually repeat those, but I am going to repeat one that I said some years ago. I was not in this job at the time, but I was out on the mashed-potato circuit. And I had been invited to address the Farm Bureau convention in Las Vegas. And on the way into the hall where the convention was taking place, one of those sharpers that inhabits Las Vegas for the gambling recognized me and said, What are you doing here? And I told him I was going in to address the Farm Bureau. And he said, What are a bunch of farmers doing in Las Vegas? And I could not resist. I said, Buster, they are in a business that makes a Las Vegas crap table look like a guaranteed annual income. Now, do not tell anyone I did this here today because I may want to do it tomorrow. But thank you again for coming here today, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthestatepresidentstheamericanfarmbureaufederation", "title": "Remarks to the State Presidents of the American Farm Bureau Federation", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-state-presidents-the-american-farm-bureau-federation", "publication_date": "13-07-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 798, "text": "Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Associated Press, Ladies, and Gentlemen: I am deeply gratified by the generous reception you have accorded me. It makes me look back with a touch of regret to former occasions when I have stood in this place and enjoyed a greater liberty than is granted me to-day. There have been times when I stood in this spot and said what I really thought, and I can not help praying that those days of indulgence may be accorded me again. I have come here to-day, of course, somewhat restrained by a sense of responsibility which I can not escape. For I take the Associated Press very seriously. I know the enormous part that you play in the affairs not only of this country but of the world. You deal in the raw material of opinion and, if my convictions have any validity, opinion ultimately governs the world. It is, therefore, of very serious things that I think as I face this body of men. I do not think of you, however, as members of the Associated Press. I do not think of you as men of different parties or of different racial derivations or of different religious denominations. I want to talk to you as to my fellow citizens of the United States, for there are serious things which as fellow citizens we ought to consider. The times behind us, gentlemen, have been difficult enough; the times before us are likely to be more difficult still, because, whatever may be said about the present condition of the world's affairs, it is clear that they are drawing rapidly to a climax, and at the climax the test will come, not only for the nations engaged in the present colossal struggle-it will come to them, of course-but the test will come for us particularly. Do you realize that, roughly speaking, we are the only great Nation at present disengaged? I am not speaking, of course, with disparagement of the greatness of those nations in Europe which are not parties to the present war, but I am thinking of their close neighborhood to it. I am thinking how their lives much more than ours touch the very heart and stuff of the business, whereas we have rolling between us and those bitter days across the water 3, 000 miles of cool and silent ocean. Our atmosphere is not yet charged with those disturbing elements which must permeate every nation of Europe. Therefore, is it not likely that the nations of the world will some day turn to us for the cooler assessment of the elements engaged? I am not now thinking so preposterous a thought as that we should sit in judgment upon them-no nation is fit to sit in judgment upon any other nation-but that we shall some day have to assist in reconstructing the processes of peace. Our resources are untouched; we are more and more becoming by the force of circumstances the mediating Nation of the world in respect of its finance. We must make up our minds what are the best things to do and what are the best ways to do them. We must put our money, our energy, our enthusiasm, our sympathy into these things, and we must have our judgments prepared and our spirits chastened against the coming of that day. So that I am not speaking in a selfish spirit when I say that our whole duty, for the present at any rate, is summed up in this motto, America first. Let us think of America before we think of Europe, in order that America may be fit to be Europe's friend when the day of tested friendship comes. The test of friendship is not now sympathy with the one side or the other, but getting ready to help both sides when the struggle is over. The basis of neutrality, gentlemen, is not indifference; it is not self-interest. The basis of neutrality is sympathy for mankind. It is fairness, it is good will, at bottom. It is impartiality of spirit and of judgment. I wish that all of our fellow citizens could realize that. There is in some quarters a disposition to create distempers in this body politic. Men are even uttering slanders against the United States, as if to excite her. Men are saying that if we should go to war upon either side there would be a divided America-an abominable libel of ignorance! America is not all of it vocal just now. It is vocal in spots, but I, for one, have a complete and abiding faith in that great silent body of Americans who are not standing up and shouting and expressing their opinions just now, but are waiting to find out and support the duty of America. I am just as sure of their solidity and of their loyalty and of their unanimity, if we act justly, as I am that the history of this country has at every crisis and turning point illustrated this great lesson. We are the mediating Nation of the world. I do not mean that we undertake not to mind our own business and to mediate where other people are quarreling. I mean the word in a broader sense. We are compounded of the nations of the world; we mediate their blood, we mediate their traditions, we mediate their sentiments, their tastes, their passions; we are ourselves compounded of those things. We are, therefore, able to understand all nations; we are able to understand them in the compound, not separately, as partisans, but unitedly as knowing and comprehending and embodying them all. It is in that sense that I mean that America is a mediating Nation. The opinion of America, the action of America, is ready to turn, and free to turn, in any direction. Did you ever reflect upon how almost every other nation has through long centuries been headed in one direction? That is not true of the United States. The United States has no racial momentum. It has no history back of it which makes it run all its energies and all its ambitions in one particular direction. And America is particularly free in this, that she has no hampering ambitions as a world power. We do not want a foot of anybody's territory. If we have been obliged by circumstances, or have considered ourselves to be obliged by circumstances, in the past, to take territory which we otherwise would not have thought of taking, I believe I am right in saying that we have considered it our duty to administer that territory, not for ourselves but for the people living in it, and to put this burden upon our consciences-not to think that this thing is ours for our use, but to regard ourselves as trustees of the great business for those to whom it does really belong, trustees ready to hand it over to the cestui que trust at any time when the business seems to make that possible and feasible. That is what I mean by saying we have no hampering ambitions. We do not want anything that does not belong to us. Is not a nation in that position free to serve other nations, and is not a nation like that ready to form some part of the assessing opinion of the world? My interest in the neutrality of the United States is not the petty desire to keep out of trouble. To judge by my experience, I have never been able to keep out of trouble. I have never looked for it, but I have always found it. I do not want to walk around trouble. If any man wants a scrap that is an interesting scrap and worth while, I am his man. I warn him that he is not going to draw me into the scrap for his advertisement, but if he is looking for trouble that is the trouble of men in general and I can help a little, why, then, I am in for it. But I am interested in neutrality because there is something so much greater to do than fight; there is a distinction waiting for this Nation that no nation has ever yet got. That is the distinction of absolute self-control and self-mastery. Whom do you admire most among your friends? The irritable man? The man out of whom you can get a rise without trying? The man who will fight at the drop of the hat, whether he knows what the hat is dropped for or not? Do not you admire and do not you fear, if you have to contest with him, the self-mastered man who watches you with calm eye and comes in only when you have carried the thing so far that you must be disposed of? That is the man you respect. That is the man who, you know, has at bottom a much more fundamental and terrible courage than the irritable, fighting man. Now, I covet for America this splendid courage of reserve moral force, and I wanted to point out to you gentlemen simply this: There is news and news. There is what is called news from Turtle Bay that turns out to be falsehood, at any rate in what it is said to signify, but which, if you could get the Nation to believe it true, might disturb our equilibrium and our self-possession. We ought not to deal in stuff of that kind. We ought not to permit that sort of thing to use up the electrical energy of the wires, because its energy is malign, its energy is not of the truth, its energy is of mischief. It is possible to sift truth. I have known some things to go out on the wires as true when there was only one man or one group of men who could have told the originators of that report whether it was true or not, and they were not asked whether it was true or not for fear it might not be true. That sort of report ought not to go out over the wires. There is generally, if not always, somebody who knows whether the thing is so or not, and in these days, above all over days, we ought to take particular pains to resort to the one small group of men, or to the one man if there be but one, who knows whether those things are true or not. The world ought to know the truth; the world ought not at this period of unstable equilibrium to be disturbed by rumor, ought not to be disturbed by imaginative combinations of circumstances, or, rather, by circumstances stated in combination which do not belong in combination. You gentlemen, and gentlemen engaged like you, are holding the balances in your hand. This unstable equilibrium rests upon scales that are in your hands. For the food of opinion, as I began by saying, is the news of the day. I have known many a man to go off at a tangent on information that was not reliable. Indeed, that describes the majority of men. The world is held stable by the man who waits for the next day to find out whether the report was true or not. We can not afford, therefore, to let the rumors of irresponsible persons and origins get into the atmosphere of the United States. We are trustees for what I venture to say is the greatest heritage that any nation ever had, the love of justice and righteousness and human liberty. For, fundamentally, those are the things to which America is addicted and to which she is devoted. There are groups of selfish men in the United States, there are coteries, where sinister things are purposed, but the great heart of the American people is just as sound and true as it ever was. And it is a single heart; it is the heart of America. It is not a heart made up of sections selected out of other countries. What I try to remind myself of every day when I am almost overcome by perplexities, what I try to remember, is what the people at home are thinking about. I try to put myself in the place of the man who does not know all the things that I know and ask myself what he would like the policy of this country to be. Not the talkative man, not the partisan man, not the man who remembers first that he is a Republican or a Democrat, or that his parents were German or English, but the man who remembers first that the whole destiny of modern affairs centers largely upon his being an American first of all. If I permitted myself to be a partisan in this present struggle, I would be unworthy to represent you. If I permitted myself to forget the people who are not partisans, I would be unworthy to be your spokesman. I am not sure that I am worthy to represent you, but I do claim this degree of worthiness-that before everything else I love America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheassociatedpressluncheonnewyorkcity", "title": "Address at the Associated Press Luncheon in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-associated-press-luncheon-new-york-city", "publication_date": "20-04-1915", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 553, "text": "Thanks so much. Well, good morning. Let me start by thanking Michael for his work and for that kind introduction. And I want to also thank Dawn Sweeny and everyone at the National Restaurant Association for having me here. It is a pleasure for me to be with you all. So today I am going to talk about food, which is something that all of you here today know a little bit about. Together, you represent 40 percent of the nearly one million restaurants in the United States, from the biggest chains to the smallest diners. You know what Americans like to eat and what they do not . You have seen how the ingredients we put in our bodies affect the way we feel and the way we feel about ourselves. And you also understand the unique role that food, and restaurants especially, play in our own lives and in the life of our nation. Restaurants have always been places to celebrate a special occasion or mark an important milestone, to bond with new friends and grow closer as a family. They provide a service to our communities unlike any other. And even as tastes and customs have changed over time, restaurants remain an incredibly dynamic part of our American story. And today, one out of every two dollars spent on food in this country goes towards meals outside the home -- and that is double what it was just 50 years ago. And one-third of all meals today are eaten in restaurants. So it is clear that eating out has become part of our American way of life. And while restaurants are still places where we go to mark a special occasion -- to celebrate a good report card, an anniversary, a job well done -- restaurants are not just for those who can afford to splurge anymore. Instead, they have grown to fit every lifestyle and every budget. And our eating habits have evolved over time as well -- both in restaurants and at home -- but not always in ways that are good for our health. And that is another reason I wanted to talk to you today -- about an issue that is near and dear to my heart not just as First Lady, but as a mother -- and that is the epidemic of childhood obesity in America today. Now, I know you are all familiar with the statistics: how one in three children in this country is overweight or obese. And you know the consequences for their health -- from hypertension and diabetes to heart disease and even cancer. And I know you are all aware of the economic impact: the billions of dollars we spend every year treating obesity-related conditions -- costs that you pay in the form of rising health insurance premiums. So it is clear that we are facing a problem that is really big. And it is also clear that this problem has a whole range of different causes. Our kids are spending less time outside and more time on the couch in front of the TV, video games, the Internet. At school, gym classes, recess, they have been eliminated or shortened. Portion sizes in this country have ballooned. In some areas, families are having a tougher time getting regular access to fresh produce. And kids these days are consuming more calories and eating more fat and sugar than ever before. And that is why, earlier this year, we launched Let us Move! This is a nationwide campaign with a simple but ambitious goal: We want to solve the problem of childhood obesity in a generation, so that kids born today can reach adulthood at a healthy weight. And Let us Move! is about attacking this problem from all different angles. It is about giving parents the information and the resources they need to make healthy decisions for their families. It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. But here is the thing. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice. And the truth is that while restaurants are offering more options and families take advantage of them more often, they are not always the healthiest choices. Research has shown that kids consume more saturated fat and less fiber and calcium when they eat out. And the meals they eat at restaurants have twice as many calories as the ones they eat at home. Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently. But when stores and restaurants do not offer healthy options, or when parents do not have the information to make the best choices for their families, that is easier said than done. And as America's restaurant owners, you are responsible for one-third of the calories our kids get on a daily basis. The choices you make determine what is listed on the menus, what is advertised on billboards, and what is served on our plates. And your decisions about how a dish is prepared, what goes into it and where is it placed on the menu, that can have a real impact on the way people eat. And that is why we need your help. And we need your help now, because when you see research showing that obese toddlers already display some warning signs for heart disease, it is clear that we just do not have the time to waste. And that is why I have been so pleased to hear about what some of you are doing already both in working with us and on your own. Here at the NRA, you have developed the Food and Healthy Living Initiative to give restaurants a strong foundation for making healthy changes. You have launched a website, Healthydiningfinder.com, to help consumers identify healthy menu options in their area. You are keeping your members up to date with the latest information and statistics about efforts to address childhood obesity. And you are working with other groups in the industry to meet the goal of doubling the amount of produce used in the food industry over the next 10 years. And across the country, individual restaurants and chains are also focusing on our children's health -- not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it also makes sense for their bottom line. Right now, many restaurants are making a point to offer fresh produce and healthy choices aimed at kids and adults. Others are serving more low-fat dishes, whole grain breads, fruit on the side. Some are even offering kid-size portions of the meals they serve on the main menu. And chefs across the country are partnering with local schools to help them make healthy choices. But as positive as these examples are, the reality is it is just not enough. Together we have to do more. We have to go further. And we need your help to lead this effort. Now, what I do know is that in the restaurant industry creativity is your lifeblood. It is what sets you apart from the competition, and it keeps customers coming back for more. And today I am asking you to use that creativity to rethink the food you offer, especially dishes aimed at young people, and to help us make the healthier choice the easier choice. First, it is important to reduce the number of empty calories that our families are consuming, calories that have no nutritional benefit whatsoever. And believe me, I know this is easier said than done. After all, we as humans, we are programmed to crave sugary, fatty, salty foods. And as people who work to meet those needs, I know it is tempting to respond by creating products that are sweeter, richer and saltier than ever before. But here is the catch. See, feeding those cravings does just respond to people's natural desires, it actually helps shape them. The more of these foods people eat, the more they are accustomed to that taste, and after a while, those unhealthy foods become a permanent part of their eating habits. But here is the good news: It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And today, no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is Italian, French, Mexican, American -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. One local survey found that 90 percent of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; 80 percent includes chicken fingers; 60 includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over 1,000 calories, and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for the entire day. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. Now, again, I know it is easier said than done. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just one token healthy option on the menu, or taking out one problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime. This philosophy also needs to apply to the rest of the food that you offer, because just as we eat out as a family, we also should be able to eat well as a family. And as a mother of two soon-to-be teenagers, I know that many kids, especially tweens and teens, eat off the same menu that their parents do. I am not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love. That could mean substituting wheat pasta for white pasta in your regular recipes, or taking out an existing -- taking an existing dish and cutting the amount of butter or cream -- not enough to sacrifice flavor -- we all like flavor -- but just enough to make a meaningful difference in the amount of calories and fat. It could mean serving 1 percent or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request -- which would hurt me deeply. I am a fry lover. And no matter what you do, it is also important, truly important, to keep portion sizes in check, because we all know that the size of a meal is just as important as the ingredients it is made of. But your role in helping address childhood obesity is not limited to what you put on your menus and how you label them for parents. It is also about how you market those products to our kids. Our kids do not learn about the latest fast-food creations on their own. They hear about them on TV, advertisements, in the Internet, video games, and many other places. And as any parent knows, this marketing is highly effective. As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids. A study last year found that only a small percentage of advertising aimed at kids promoted healthy foods, while most promoted foods with a low nutritional value. And let us be clear: It is not enough just to limit ads for foods that are not healthy. It is also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy. And if there is anyone who can sell healthy food to our kids, it is all of you, because you know what gets their attention. You know what makes a lasting impression. You certainly know what gets them to drive their poor parents crazy because they just have to have something. So I am here today to ask you to use that knowledge and that power to our kids' advantage. I am asking you to actively promote healthy foods and healthy habits to our kids. Again, I know many of you have said that you would offer and promote healthy options in a heartbeat if they were as popular as the healthy -- unhealthy options, because that is how business works, and I understand that. But I have yet to meet a single parent who does not understand the threat of childhood obesity. I have yet to meet a single parent who is not eager to buy healthier products. They just need more information. They need easier access to those products. And I have heard from more companies over the year that the market is starting to move in a healthier direction. Folks are beginning to ask for more fruits and vegetables and for smaller portions. So when it comes right down to it, this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again. That is why we are committed to helping increase that demand and making it easier for you to do what is right. And we have started by requiring chain restaurants to provide calorie counts on their menus and menu boards. And I am grateful for the support we have received from the NRA to get this done. And I want to encourage restaurants that are not providing calorie counts to join us in this effort. And because so many of the calories our kids consume come from school, we are also working to get more nutritious food into our lunchrooms and our vending machines. And, again, the NRA has been playing an important role in these efforts as well. As part of Let us Move, we are setting a goal of doubling the number of schools that participate in the Healthier US Schools Challenge by next year. And we are working with schools and food suppliers to offer more fruits and vegetables and to cut down on that fat, sugar and salt. And, finally, we are working with mayors and other local officials to make our cities and towns healthier and to highlight restaurants that agree to serve smaller portions and promote more nutritious options. So I hope that all of you will join with us in these efforts. Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice. We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity. And we can help create a culture -- imagine this -- where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them. See, after all, that is one of the core ideals this industry was founded on. I recently learned that the term restaurant actually comes from the French word for restore. And when the idea of the restaurant business spread across the ocean, some of the first true restaurants in this country emphasized their ability to make people healthier and to cure what ailed them. So today, you are all the heirs to that legacy. And you face a similar opportunity both as business owners -- but also as parents, not just to fulfill your obligations to shareholders, but to fulfill the obligation we all have to the next generation. So I hope that each of you will do your part to give our kids the future that we all know they deserve. And I want to truly thank you for what you have done, because you have done so much, and for what you are going to do. I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead. Good luck to you all and God bless you and your families. Take care.

{"id": 924, "text": "ENTITY gave a speech on July 3 at a Fourth of July firework event at Mt. Rushmore in South Dakota. Read the full speech transcript here. Well, thank you very much. Governor Noem, Secretary Bernhardt, we very much appreciate it. Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and a very special hello to South Dakota. As we begin this 4th of July weekend, the First Lady and I would wish each and every one of you a very, very happy Independence Day. Thank you. Let us show our appreciation to the South Dakota Army and Air National Guard and the Air Force for inspiring us with that magnificent display of American air power, and of course our gratitude as always to the legendary and very talented Blue Angels. Thank you very much. Let us also send you our deepest thanks to our wonderful veterans, law enforcement, first responders, and the doctors, nurses, and scientists working tirelessly to kill the virus. They are working hard. I want to thank them very, very much. We are grateful as well to your state's congressional delegation. Senator John Thune. John, thank you very much. Senator Mike Rounds. Thank you, Mike. And Dusty Johnson, Congressman. Hi, Dusty. Thank you. And all others with us tonight from Congress, thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it. There could be no better place to celebrate America's independence than beneath this magnificent, incredible majestic mountain and monument to the greatest Americans who have ever lived. Today we pay tribute to the exceptional lives and extraordinary legacies of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt. I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated, these heroes will never be defamed, their legacy will never ever be destroyed, their achievements will never be forgotten, and Mount Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers and to our freedom. We gather tonight to herald the most important day in the history of nations, July 4th, 1776. At those words, every American heart should swell with pride, every American family should cheer with delight, and every American patriot should be filled with joy because each of you lives in the most magnificent country in the history of the world and it will soon be greater than ever before. Our founders launched not only a revolution in government, but a revolution in the pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity. No nation has done more to advance the human condition than the United States of America and no people have done more to promote human progress than the citizens of our great nation. It was all made possible by the courage of 56 patriots who gathered in Philadelphia 244 years ago and signed the Declaration of Independence. They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said, All men are created equal. These immortal words set in motion the unstoppable march of freedom. Our founders boldly declared that we are all endowed with the same divine rights, given us by our Creator in Heaven, and that which God has given us, we will allow no one ever to take away ever. 1776 represented the culmination of thousands of years of Western civilization and the triumph of not only spirit, but of wisdom, philosophy, and reason. And yet, as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure. Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children. Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities. Many of these people have no idea why they are doing this, but some know what they are doing. They think the American people are weak and soft and submissive, but no, the American people are strong and proud and they will not allow our country and all of its values, history, and culture to be taken from them. One of their political weapons is cancel culture, driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees. This is the very definition of totalitarianism, and it is completely alien to our culture and to our values and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America. This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty must be stopped and it will be stopped very quickly. We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation's children from this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life. In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance. If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished. It is not going to happen to us. Make no mistake. This left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger, and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery, and progress. To make this possible, they are determined to tear down every statue, symbol, and memory of our national heritage. True. That is very true actually. That is why I am deploying federal law enforcement to protect our monuments, arrest the rioters, and prosecutors offenders to the fullest extent of the law. I am pleased to report that yesterday, federal agents arrested the suspected ringleader of the attack on the statue of the great Andrew Jackson in Washington, D.C., and in addition, hundreds more have been arrested. Under the executive order I signed last week pertaining to the Veterans Memorial Preservation Memorial and Recognition Act and other laws, people who damage or deface federal statues or monuments will get a minimum of 10 years in prison and obviously that includes our beautiful Mount Rushmore. Our people have a great memory. They will never forget the destruction of statues and monuments to George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionists and many others. The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets and cities that are run by liberal Democrats in every case is the predictable result of years of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism, and other cultural institutions. Against every law of society and nature, our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains. The radical view of American history is a web of lies, all perspective is removed, every virtue is obscured, every motive is twisted, every fact is distorted and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition. This movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on Mount Rushmore. They defiled the memory of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Today we will set history and history's record straight. Before these figures were immortalized in stone, they were American giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men, whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known. Tonight I will tell you and most importantly the youth of our nation the true stories of these great, great men. From head to toe George Washington represented the strength, grace, and dignity of the American people. From a small volunteer force of citizen farmers, he created the Continental Army out of nothing and rallied them to stand against the most powerful military on earth. Through eight long years, through the brutal winter at Valley Forge, through setback after setback on the field of battle, he led those patriots to ultimate triumph. When the army had dwindled to a few thousand men at Christmas of 1776, when defeat seemed absolutely certain, he took what remained of his forces on a daring nighttime crossing of the Delaware River. They marched through nine miles of frigid darkness, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. In the morning, they seized victory at Trenton after forcing the surrender of the most powerful empire on the planet at Yorktown, General Washington did not claim power but simply returned to Mount Vernon as a private citizen. When called upon again, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was unanimously elected our first president. When he stepped down after two terms, his former adversary, King George called him the greatest man of the age. He remains first in our hearts to this day, for as long as Americans love this land, we will honor and cherish the father of our country, George Washington. He will never be removed, abolished, and most of all, he will never be forgotten. Thomas Jefferson, the great Thomas Jefferson, was 33 years old when he traveled north to Pennsylvania and brilliantly authored one of the greatest treasures of human history, the Declaration of Independence. He also drafted Virginia's constitution and conceived and wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, a model for our cherished First Amendment. After serving as the first Secretary of State, and then Vice President, he was elected to the presidency. He ordered American warriors to crush Barbary pirates. He doubled the size of our nation with the Louisiana Purchase and he sent the famous explorers Lewis and Clark into the west on a daring expedition to the Pacific Ocean. He was an architect, an inventor, a diplomat, a scholar, the founder of one of the world's great universities and an ardent defender of liberty. Americans will forever admire the author of American freedom, Thomas Jefferson, and he too will never, ever be abandoned by us. Abraham Lincoln, the savior of our union, was a self-taught country lawyer who grew up in a log cabin on the American frontier. The first Republican president, he rose to high office from obscurity based on a force and clarity of his anti-slavery convictions. Very, very strong convictions. He signed the law that built the Trans-Continental Railroad. He signed the Homestead Act given to some incredible scholars as simply defined ordinary citizens free land to settle anywhere in the American West, and he led the country through the darkest hours of American history, giving every ounce of strength that he had to ensure that government of the people, by the people and for the people did not perish from this earth. He served as commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces during our bloodiest war, the struggle that saved our union and extinguished the evil of slavery. Over 600,000 died in that war, more than 20, 000 were killed or wounded in a single day in Antietam. At Gettysburg 157 years ago, the Union bravely withstood an assault of nearly 15,000 men and threw back Pickett's Charge. Lincoln won the Civil War. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He led the passage of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery for all-time and ultimately his determination to preserve our nation and our union cost him his life. For as long as we live, Americans will uphold and revere the immortal memory of President Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt exemplified the unbridled confidence of our national culture and identity. He saw the towering grandeur of America's mission in the world and he pursued it with overwhelming energy and zeal. As a Lieutenant Colonel during the Spanish-American War, he led the famous Rough Riders to defeat the enemy at San Juan Hill. He cleaned up corruption as police commissioner of New York City, then served as the Governor of New York, Vice President, and at 42 years old, became the youngest ever President of the United States. He sent our great new naval fleet around the globe to announce America's arrival as a world power. He gave us many of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon. He oversaw the construction of the awe-inspiring Panama Canal and he is the only person ever awarded both the Nobel Peace Prize and the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was American freedom personified in full. The American people will never relinquish the bold, beautiful and untamed spirit of Theodore Roosevelt. No movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured American legacies can possibly have a love of America at its heart. Cannot happen. No person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future. The radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice, but in truth, it would demolish both justice and society. It would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and it would turn our free and inclusive society into a place of a repression, domination, and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced. We will state the truth in full without apology. We declare that the United States of America is the most just and exceptional nation ever to exist on earth. We are proud of the fact that our country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles and we understand that these values have dramatically advanced the cause of peace and justice throughout the world. We know that the American family is the bedrock of American life. We recognize the solemn right and moral duty of every nation to secure its borders and we are building the wall. We remember that governments exist to protect the safety and happiness of their own people. A nation must care for its own citizens first. We must take care of America first. It is time. We believe in equal opportunity, equal justice, and equal treatment for citizens of every race, background, religion and creed. Every child of every color, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God. We want free and open debate, not speech codes and cancel culture. We embrace tolerance, not prejudice. We support the courageous men and women of law enforcement. We will never abolish our police or our great Second Amendment which gives us the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that our children should be taught to love their country, honor their history, and respect our great American flag. We stand tall, we stand proud, and we only kneel to Almighty God. This is who we are. This is what we believe and these are the values that will guide us as we strive to build an even better and greater future. Those who seek to erase our heritage want Americans to forget our pride and our great dignity so that we can no longer understand ourselves or America's destiny. In toppling the heroes of 1776, they seek to dissolve the bonds of love and loyalty that we feel for our country and that we feel for each other. Their goal is not a better America, their goal is to end America. In its place, they want power for themselves, but just as patriots did in centuries past, the American people will stand in their way and we will win and win quickly and with great dignity. We will never let them rip America's heroes from our monuments or from our hearts. By tearing down Washington and Jefferson, these radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War, they would erase the memory that inspired those soldiers to go to their deaths, singing these words of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, while God is marching on. They would tear down the principles that propelled the abolition of slavery and ultimately around the world ending an evil institution that had plagued humanity for thousands and thousands of years. Our opponents would tear apart the very documents that Martin Luther King used to express his dream and the ideas that were the foundation of the righteous movement for Civil Rights. They would tear down the beliefs, culture and identity, that have made America the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the earth. My fellow Americans, it is time to speak up loudly and strongly and powerfully and defend the integrity of our country. It is time for our politicians to summon the bravery and determination of our American ancestors. It is time. It is time to plant our flag and to protect the greatest of this nation for citizens of every race in every city in every part of this glorious land. For the sake of our honor, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our union, we must protect and preserve our history, our heritage, and our great heroes. Here tonight before the eyes of our forefathers, Americans declare again, as we did 244 years ago, that we will not be tyrannized, we will not be demeaned, and we will not be intimidated by bad, evil people. It will not happen. We will proclaim the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and we will never surrender the spirit and the courage and the cause of July 4, 1776. Upon this ground, we will stand firm and unwavering. In the face of lies meant to divide us, demoralize us and diminish us, we will show that the story of America unites us and - We will show that the story of America unites us, inspires us, includes us all, and makes everyone free. We must demand that our children are taught once again to see America as did Reverend Martin Luther King when he said that the founders had signed a promissory note to every future generation. Dr. King saw that the mission of justice required us to fully embrace our founding ideals. Those ideals are so important to us, the founding ideals. He called on his fellow citizens not to rip down their heritage, but to live up to their heritage. Above all, our children from every community must be taught that to be American is to inherit the spirit of the most adventurous and confident people ever to walk the face of the Earth. Americans are the people who pursued our Manifest Destiny across the ocean, into the uncharted wilderness, over the tallest mountains, and then into the skies, and even into the stars. We are the country of Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Frederick Douglas. We are the land of Wild Bill Hickock and Buffalo Bill Cody. We are the nation that gave rise to the Wright brothers, the Tuskegee airmen, Harriet Tubman, Clara Barton, Jesse Owens, George Patton, General George Patton, the great Louis Armstrong, Alan Shepard, Elvis Presley, and Muhammad Ali, and only America could have produced them all. No other place. We are the culture that put up the Hoover Dam, laid down the highways, and sculpted the skyline of Manhattan. We are the people who dreamed the spectacular dream, it was called Las Vegas in the Nevada desert, who built up Miami from the Florida marsh, and who carved our heroes into the face of Mount Rushmore. Americans harnessed electricity, split the atom, and gave the world the telephone and the internet. We settled the Wild West, won two World Wars, landed American astronauts on the moon. And one day very soon, we will plant our flag on Mars. We gave the world the poetry of Walt Whitman, the stories of Mark Twain, the songs of Irving Berlin, the voice of Ella Fitzgerald, the style of Frank Sinatra, the comedy of Bob Hope, the power of the Saturn V rocket, the toughness of the Ford F150, and the awesome might of the American aircraft carriers. Americans must never lose sight of this miraculous story. We should never lose sight of it. Nobody has ever done it like we have done it. So today, under the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I am announcing the creation of a new monument to the giants of our past. I am signing an executive order to establish the National Guard of American heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live. From this night, and from this magnificent place, let us go forward united in our purpose and rededicated in our resolve. We will raise the next generation of American patriots. We will write the next thrilling chapter of the American adventure. And we will teach our children to know that they live in a land of legends, that nothing can stop them, and that no one can hold them down. They will know that, in America, you can do anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Uplifted by the titans of Mount Rushmore, we will find unity that no one expected. We will make strides that no one thought possible. This country will be everything that our citizens have hoped for for so many years, and that our enemies fear, because we will never forget that the American freedom exists for American greatness. And that is what we have, American greatness. Centuries from now, our legacy will be the cities we built, the champions we forged, the good that we did, and the monuments we created to inspire us all. My fellow citizens, America's destiny is in our sights. America's heroes are embedded in our hearts. America's future is in our hands. And ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come. This has been a great honor for the First Lady and myself to be with you. I love your state. I love this country. I'd like to wish everybody a very happy Fourth of July to all. God bless you. God bless your families. God bless our great military, and God bless America. Thank you very much.

{"id": 963, "text": "Thank you, Ohio! Thank you, Cleveland! Thank you so much. Thank you very much, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. We have got some business to do today. Thank you very much. I love you back. Thank you. Before we get started I want to just acknowledge some outstanding public servants who are here. First of all, somebody who I believe is one of the finest governors in this country -- Ted Strickland is here. The lieutenant-governor and soon-to-be junior senator from the great state of Illinois -- or Ohio -- I was thinking about my own home -- Lee Fisher is here. I used to hear that line all the time about senator from Illinois -- that would be me. Outstanding mayor of Cleveland, Frank Jackson is here. The mayor of Parma, Dean DePiero. Somebody who is fighting for working families each and every day, Senator Sherrod Brown is here. And three of the hardest-working and finest members of the House of Representatives -- Dennis Kucinich, Marcia Fudge, and John Boccieri. Good afternoon, everybody. It is good to be back in Ohio. You know, in the fall of 2008, one of the last rallies of my presidential campaign was right here in the Cleveland area. It was a hopeful time, just two days before the election. And we knew that if we pulled it off, we'd finally have the chance to tackle some big and difficult challenges that had been facing this country for a very long time. We also hoped for a chance to get beyond some of the old political divides -- between Democrats and Republicans, red states and blue states -- that had prevented us from making progress. Because although we are proud to be Democrats, we are prouder to be Americans ---- and we believed then and we believe now that no single party has a monopoly on wisdom. That is not to say that the election did not expose deep differences between the parties. I ran for President because for much of the last decade, a very specific governing philosophy had reigned about how America should work: Cut taxes, especially for millionaires and billionaires. Cut regulations for special interests. Cut trade deals even if they did not benefit our workers. Cut back on investments in our people and in our future -- in education and clean energy, in research and technology. The idea was that if we just had blind faith in the market, if we let corporations play by their own rules, if we left everyone else to fend for themselves that America would grow and America would prosper. And for a time this idea gave us the illusion of prosperity. We saw financial firms and CEOs take in record profits and record bonuses. We saw a housing boom that led to new homeowners and new jobs in construction. Consumers bought more condos and bigger cars and better TVs. But while all this was happening, the broader economy was becoming weaker. Nobody understands that more than the people of Ohio. Job growth between 2000 and 2008 was slower than it had been in any economic expansion since World War II -- slower than it is been over the last year. The wages and incomes of middle-class families kept falling while the cost of everything from tuition to health care kept on going up. Folks were forced to put more debt on their credit cards and borrow against homes that many could not afford to buy in the first place. And meanwhile, a failure to pay for two wars and two tax cuts for the wealthy helped turn a record surplus into a record deficit. I ran for President because I believed that this kind of economy was unsustainable -- for the middle class and for the future of our nation. I ran because I had a different idea about how America was built. It was an idea rooted in my own family's story. You see, Michelle and I are where we are today because even though our families did not have much, they worked tirelessly -- without complaint -- so that we might have a better life. My grandfather marched off to Europe in World War II, while my grandmother worked in factories on the home front. I had a single mom who put herself through school, and would wake before dawn to make sure I got a decent education. Michelle can still remember her father heading out to his job as a city worker long after multiple sclerosis had made it impossible for him to walk without crutches. He always got to work; he just had to get up a little earlier. Yes, our families believed in the American values of self-reliance and individual responsibility, and they instilled those values in their children. But they also believed in a country that rewards responsibility; a country that rewards hard work; a country built on the promise of opportunity and upward mobility. They believed in an America that gave my grandfather the chance to go to college because of the GI Bill; an America that gave my grandparents the chance to buy a home because of the Federal Housing Authority; an America that gave their children and grandchildren the chance to fulfill our dreams thanks to college loans and college scholarships. It was an America where you did not buy things you could not afford; where we did not just think about today -- we thought about tomorrow. An America that took pride in the goods that we made, not just the things we consumed. An America where a rising tide really did lift all boats, from the company CEO to the guy on the assembly line. That is the America I believe in. That is the America I believe in. That is what led me to work in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant on the South Side of Chicago when I was a community organizer. It is what led me to fight for factory workers at manufacturing plants that were closing across Illinois when I was a senator. It is what led me to run for President -- because I do not believe we can have a strong and growing economy without a strong and growing middle class. Now, much has happened since that election. The flawed policies and economic weaknesses of the previous decade culminated in a financial crisis and the worst recession of our lifetimes. And my hope was that the crisis would cause everybody, Democrats and Republicans, to pull together and tackle our problems in a practical way. But as we all know, things did not work out that way. Some Republican leaders figured it was smart politics to sit on the sidelines and let Democrats solve the mess. Others believed on principle that government should not meddle in the markets, even when the markets are broken. But with the nation losing nearly 800,000 jobs the month that I was sworn into office, my most urgent task was to stop a financial meltdown and prevent this recession from becoming a second depression. And, Ohio, we have done that. The economy is growing again. The financial markets have stabilized. The private sector has created jobs for the last eight months in a row. And there are roughly 3 million Americans who are working today because of the economic plan we put into place. But the truth is progress has been painfully slow. Millions of jobs were lost before our policies even had a chance to take effect. We lost 4 million in the six months before I took office. It was a hole so deep that even though we have added jobs again, millions of Americans remain unemployed. Hundreds of thousands of families have lost their homes. Millions more can barely pay the bills or make the mortgage. The middle class is still treading water, and those aspiring to reach the middle class are doing everything they can to keep from drowning. And meanwhile, some of the very steps that were necessary to save the economy -- like temporarily supporting the banks and the auto industry -- fed the perception that Washington is still ignoring the middle class in favor of special interests. And so people are frustrated and they are angry and they are anxious about the future. I understand that. I also understand that in a political campaign, the easiest thing for the other side to do is to ride this fear and anger all the way to Election Day. That is what is happening right now. A few weeks ago, the Republican leader of the House came here to Cleveland and offered his party's answer to our economic challenges. Now, it would be one thing if he had admitted his party's mistakes during the eight years that they were in power, if they had gone off for a while and meditated, and come back and offered a credible new approach to solving our country's problems. But that is not what happened. There were no new policies from Mr. Boehner. There were no new ideas. There was just the same philosophy that we had already tried during the decade that they were in power -- the same philosophy that led to this mess in the first place: Cut more taxes for millionaires and cut more rules for corporations. Instead of coming together like past generations did to build a better country for our children and grandchildren, their argument is that we should let insurance companies go back to denying care for folks who are sick, or let credit card companies go back to raising rates without any reason. Instead of setting our sights higher, they are asking us to settle for a status quo of stagnant growth and eroding competitiveness and a shrinking middle class. Cleveland, that is not the America I know. That is not the America we believe in. A lot has changed since I came here in those final days of the last election, but what has not is the choice facing this country. It is still fear versus hope; the past versus the future. It is still a choice between sliding backward and moving forward. That is what this election is about. That is the choice you will face in November. Now, we have a different vision for the future. See, I have never believed that government has all the answers to our problems. I have never believed that government's role is to create jobs or prosperity. I believe it is the drive and the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs, our small businesses; the skill and dedication of our workers ---- that is made us the wealthiest nation on Earth. I believe it is the private sector that must be the main engine for our recovery. I believe government should be lean; government should be efficient. I believe government should leave people free to make the choices they think are best for themselves and their families, so long as those choices do not hurt others. But in the words of the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, I also believe that government should do for the people what they cannot do better for themselves. And that means making the long-term investments in this country's future that individuals and corporations cannot make on their own: investments in education and clean energy, in basic research and technology and infrastructure. That means making sure corporations live up to their responsibilities to treat consumers fairly and play by the same rules as everyone else. Their responsibility is to look out for their workers, as well as their shareholders, and create jobs here at home. And that means providing a hand-up for middle-class families -- so that if they work hard and meet their responsibilities, they can afford to raise their children, and send them to college, see a doctor when they get sick, retire with dignity and respect. That is what we Democrats believe in -- a vibrant free market, but one that works for everybody. That is our vision. That is our vision for a stronger economy and a growing middle class. And that is the difference between what we and Republicans in Congress are offering the American people right now. Let me give you a few specific examples of our different approaches. This week, I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. One of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in the United States. But for years, our tax code has actually given billions of dollars in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in Ohio, right here in the United States of America. And I am proposing that all American businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in 2011. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like Cleveland and Toledo and Dayton. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. But not to Mr. Boehner and his allies. For years, Republicans have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. Boehner was here in Cleveland he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like Ohio keep hundreds of thousands of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. Mr. Boehner dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. And I could not disagree more. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps America strong. And, Ohio, I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in America -- not that create jobs overseas. That is one difference between the Republican vision and the Democratic vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example. We want to put more Americans back to work rebuilding America -- our roads, our railways, our runways. When the housing sector collapsed and the recession hit, one in every four jobs lost were in the construction industry. That is partly why our economic plan has invested in badly needed infrastructure projects over the last 19 months -- not just roads and bridges, but high-speed railroads and expanded broadband access. Altogether, these projects have led to thousands of good, private sector jobs, especially for those in the trades. Mr. Boehner and the Republicans in Congress said no to these projects. Fought them tooth and nail. Though I should say it did not stop a lot of them from showing up at the ribbon-cuttings ---- trying to take credit. That is always a sight to see. Now, there are still thousands of miles of railroads and railways and runways left to repair and improve. And engineers, economists, governors, mayors of every political stripe believe that if we want to compete in this global economy, we need to rebuild this vital infrastructure. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the most modern airports -- we want to put people to work building them right here in America. So this week, I have proposed a six-year infrastructure plan that would start putting Americans to work right away. But despite the fact that this has traditionally been an issue with bipartisan support, Mr. Boehner has so far said no to infrastructure. That is bad for America -- and that, too, is what this election is all about. I will give you one final example of the differences between us and the Republicans, and that is on the issue of tax cuts. Under the tax plan passed by the last administration, taxes are scheduled to go up substantially next year -- for everybody. By the way, this was by design. When they passed these tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, they did not want everybody to know what it would do to our deficit, so they pretended like they were going to end, even though now they say they do not . Now, I believe we ought to make the tax cuts for the middle class permanent. For the middle class, permanent. These families are the ones who saw their wages and incomes flat-line over the last decade -- you deserve a break. You deserve some help. And because folks in the middle class are more likely to spend their tax cut on basic necessities, that strengthens the economy as a whole. But the Republican leader of the House does not want to stop there. Make no mistake: He and his party believe we should also give a permanent tax cut to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. With all the other budgetary pressures we have -- with all the Republicans' talk about wanting to shrink the deficit -- they would have us borrow $700 billion over the next 10 years to give a tax cut of about $100,000 each to folks who are already millionaires. And keep in mind wealthy Americans are just about the only folks who saw their incomes rise when Republicans were in charge. And these are the folks who are less likely to spend the money -- which is why economists do not think tax breaks for the wealthy would do much to boost the economy. So let me be clear to Mr. Boehner and everybody else: We should not hold middle-class tax cuts hostage any longer. We are ready, this week, if they want, to give tax cuts to every American making $250,000 or less. That is 98-97 percent of Americans. Now, for any income over this amount, the tax rates would just go back to what they were under President Clinton. This is not to punish folks who are better off -- God bless them. It is because we cannot afford the $700 billion price tag. And for those who claim that our approach would somehow be bad for growth and bad for small businesses, let me remind you that with those tax rates in place, under President Clinton, this country created 22 million jobs and raised incomes and had the largest surplus in our history. In fact, if the Republican leadership in Congress really wants to help small businesses, they will stop using legislative maneuvers to block an up or down vote on a small business jobs bill that is before the Senate right now. Right now. This is a bill that would do two things. It would cut taxes for small businesses and make loans more available for small businesses. It is fully paid for, will not add to the deficit. And it was written by Democrats and Republicans. And yet, the other party continues to block this jobs bill -- a delay that small business owners have said is actually leading them to put off hiring. Look, I recognize that most of the Republicans in Congress have said no to just about every policy I have proposed since taking office. I realize in some cases that there are genuine philosophical differences. But on issues like this one -- a tax cut for small businesses supported by the Chamber of Commerce -- the only reason they are holding this up is politics, pure and simple. They are making the same calculation they made just before my inauguration: If I fail, they win. Well, they might think that this will get them to where they want to go in November, but it will not get our country going where it needs to go in the long run. It will not get us there. It will not get us there. It will not get us there. So that is the choice, Ohio. Do we return to the same failed policies that ran our economy into a ditch, or do we keep moving forward with policies that are slowly pulling us out? Do we settle for a slow decline, or do we reach for an America with a growing economy and a thriving middle class? That is the America that I see. We may not be there yet, but we know where this country needs to go. We see a future where we invest in American innovation and American ingenuity; where we export more goods so we create more jobs here at home; where we make it easier to start a business or patent an invention; where we build a homegrown, clean energy industry -- because I do not want to see new solar panels or electric cars or advanced batteries manufactured in Europe or Asia. I want to see them made right here in the U.S. of A by American workers. We see an America where every citizen has the skills and training to compete with any worker in the world. That is why we have set a goal to once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. That is why we are revitalizing community colleges like this one. That is why we are reforming our education system based on what works for our children, not what perpetuates the status quo. We see an America where a growing middle class is the beating heart of a growing economy. That is why I kept my campaign promise and gave a middle-class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans. That is why we passed health insurance reform that stops insurance companies from jacking up your premiums at will or denying coverage because you get sick. That is why we passed financial reform that will end taxpayer-funded bailouts; reform that will stop credit card companies and mortgage lenders from taking advantage of taxpayers and consumers. That is why we are trying to make it easier for workers to save for retirement and fighting the efforts of some in the other party to privatize Social Security -- because as long as I am President, no one is going to take the retirement savings of a generation of Americans and hand it over to Wall Street. Not on my watch. That is why we are fighting to extend the child tax credit and make permanent our new college tax credit, because if we do, it will mean $10,000 in tuition relief for each child going to four years of college. And I do not want any parent not to be sending their kids, in good time or bad, to college because they cannot afford it. And finally, we see an America where we refuse to pass on the debt we inherited to the next generation. Now, let me spend just a minute on this issue, because we have heard a lot of moralizing on the other side about this -- government spending and debt. Along with the tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they will stop government spending. Now, it is right to be concerned about the long-term deficit. If we do not get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it is time for government to show some discipline, too. But let us look at the facts. When these same Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down. These same Republicans turned a record surplus into a record deficit. When I walked in, wrapped in a nice bow was a $1.3 trillion deficit sitting right there on my doorstep. A welcoming present. Just this year, these same Republicans voted against a bipartisan fiscal commission that they themselves had proposed. Once I decided I was for it, they were against it. And when you ask them what programs they'd actually cut they do not have an answer. That is not fiscal responsibility. That is not a serious plan to govern. Now, I will be honest -- I refuse to cut back on those investments that will grow our economy in the future -- investments in areas like education and clean energy and technology. I do not want to cut those things. And that is because economic growth is the single best way to bring down the deficit -- and we need these investments to grow. But I am absolutely committed to fiscal responsibility, which is why I have already proposed freezing all discretionary spending unrelated to national security for the next three years. And once the bipartisan fiscal commission finishes its work, I will spend the next year making the tough choices necessary to further reduce our deficit and lower our debt -- whether I get help from the other side or not. Of course, reducing the deficit will not be easy. Making up for the 8 million lost jobs caused by this recession will not happen overnight. Not everything we have done over the last two years has worked as quickly as we had hoped, and I am keenly aware that not all of our policies have been popular. So, no, our job is not easy. But you did not elect me to do what was easy. You did not elect me to just read the polls and figure how to keep myself in office. You did not elect me to avoid big problems. You elected me to do what was right. And as long as I am President, that is exactly what I intend to do. This country is emerging from an incredibly difficult period in its history -- an era of irresponsibility that stretched from Wall Street to Washington, and had a devastating effect on a lot of people. We have started turning the corner on that era. But part of moving forward is returning to the time-honored values that built this country: hard work and self-reliance; responsibility for ourselves, but also responsibility for one another. It is about moving from an attitude that said What is in it for me? to one that asks, What is best for America? What is best for all our workers? What is best for all of our businesses? What is best for all of our children? These values are not Democratic or Republican. They are not conservative or liberal values. They are American values. As Democrats, we take pride in what our party has accomplished over the last century: Social Security and the minimum wage; the GI Bill and Medicare; civil rights and worker's rights and women's rights. But we also recognize that throughout our history, there has been a noble Republican vision as well, of what this country can be. It was the vision of Abraham Lincoln, who set up the first land grant colleges and launched the transcontinental railroad; the vision of Teddy Roosevelt, who used the power of government to break up monopolies; the vision of Dwight Eisenhower, who helped build the Interstate Highway System. And, yes, the vision of Ronald Reagan, who despite his aversion to government, was willing to help save Social Security for future generations -- working with Democrats. These were serious leaders for serious times. They were great politicians, but they did not spend all their time playing games or scoring points. They did not always prey on people's fears and anxieties. They made mistakes, but they did what they thought was in the best interests of their country and its people. And that is what the American people expect of us today -- Democrats, independents, and Republicans. That is the debate they deserve. That is the leadership we owe them. I know that folks are worried about the future. I know there is still a lot of hurt out here. And when times are tough, I know it can be tempting to give in to cynicism and fear and doubt and division -- and just settle our sights a little bit lower, settle for something a little bit less. But that is not who we are, Ohio. Those are not the values that built this country. We are here today because in the worst of times, the people who came before us brought out the best in America. Because our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents were willing to work and sacrifice for us. They were willing to take great risks, and face great hardship, and reach for a future that would give us the chance at a better life. They knew that this country is greater than the sum of its parts -- that America is not about the ambitions of any one individual, but the aspirations of an entire people, an entire nation. That is who we are. That is our legacy. And I am convinced that if we are willing to summon those values today, and if we are willing to choose hope over fear, and choose the future over the past, and come together once more around the great project of national renewal, then we will restore our economy and rebuild our middle class and reclaim the American Dream for the next generation. Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "clevelandcomopen201009transcriptofpresidentobamas1html", "title": "Transcript of President Obama's speech at Cuyahoga Community College", "source": "https://www.cleveland.com/open/2010/09/transcript_of_president_obamas_1.html", "publication_date": "", "crawling_date": "02-07-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 624, "text": "Hello, everybody! Well, it is wonderful to see all of you here today. Happy Thanksgiving, and welcome to the White House. Tomorrow is one of the best days of the year to be an American. It is a day to count our blessings, spend time with the ones we love, and enjoy some good food and some great company. But it is also one of the worst days of the year to be a turkey. They do not have it so good. The rare exception, of course, are the two birds who've joined me today. Now, is Peace here or just Liberty? Just Liberty is here, but Peace is back here somewhere. Some of you may know that recently I have been taking a series of executive actions that do not require congressional approval. Well, here is another one. We cannot wait to pardon these turkeys. Literally. Otherwise they'd end up next to the mashed potatoes and stuffing. I want to thank Richard Huisinga, the chairman of the National Turkey Federation, and his wonderful family for donating this year's turkey from his farm in Willmar, Minnesota. The turkey's name is Liberty--there he is--and along with his understudy named Peace, he has the distinction of being the luckiest bird on the face of the Earth. Right now he is also probably one of the most confused. Liberty was chosen from a flock of about 30 other contestants for the honor of being here today. And for the first time in history, these two turkeys were raised by four students from nearby Willmar High School. Now, I am told that in order to prepare Liberty and Peace for their big day, the students exposed them to loud noises and flashbulbs so that they'd be ready to face the White House press corps. This is actually true. They also received the most important part of their media training, which involves learning how to gobble without really saying anything. So Liberty is ready for his turn in the spotlight. And after he finishes a round of cable hits and a few Sunday shows, he is going to retire to a life of leisure at Mount Vernon, the same place where George Washington spent his golden years. And later today Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and I will also be taking two unnamed turkeys, who were not so lucky, to a local food bank here in DC that helps those in need. And I want to thank the folks at Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Orefield, Pennsylvania, for donating these dressed birds for the third year in a row. A great writer once called Thanksgiving the one day that is ours . . . the one day that is purely American. When we gather around our tables tomorrow to share the fruits of our blessings, let us remember what that means. Let us be grateful for what we have. Let us be mindful of those who have less. Let us appreciate those who hold a special place in our lives and make sure that they know it. And let us think about those who cannot spend the holiday with their loved ones, especially the members of our military serving overseas. I'd like to thank all our men and women in uniform and their families for their incredible service and devotion. And that is what being an American is all about. Even when times are tough, we look out for each other. We lift each other up. And we remind ourselves just how lucky we are here, together, in the greatest country on Earth. So from our family to yours, I want to wish everybody a wonderful and happy and healthy Thanksgiving. And now, since Liberty and Peace have been so patient, it is my privilege to grant them the official pardon. And I am going to--I have got to give them a little symbol. You are hereby pardoned. Give him a round of applause.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthethanksgivingturkeypresentationceremony10", "title": "Remarks at the Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation Ceremony", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-thanksgiving-turkey-presentation-ceremony-10", "publication_date": "23-11-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 922, "text": "Thank you all. Thanks for coming. Please. Windy, thank you very much. I am proud of you. I am proud of your dedication. It is a great country where Windy can come from a Head Start program and is now a leader in the movement to make sure Head Start fulfills the promise of the program. First, I want to thank the good folks here at Highland Park Elementary School for letting me come by and see a program which works. I do not know if the people in the State of Maryland know this-I know the Governor does-that the teachers here and the program here uses a strategy, what they call a Center for Improving Readiness for Children, Learning, and Education, C.I.R.C.L.E., which is a model program. It is a program that incorporates profound and simple reading lessons necessary to lay the foundation for future readers. And it is a program that is working. There is a strong emphasis on learning. There is obviously the continued Head Start focus on good nutrition and health care. This program also works well because the parents are involved. So, I have really come to say a couple of things. One, I want to thank the good folks at this learning institution for your focus and dedication. I also want to say that this is possible, this program is possible, to be spread around the country. I mean, this is what we need to do. That is what we are here to talk about. We are really here to talk about how to make sure Head Start works. I will never forget the lady in Houston, Texas, who stood up at one time and she said, Reading is the new civil right. Her point was, is that if you cannot read, it is hard to access the greatness of America. And if reading is the new civil right, a good place to start with civil rights is at the Head Start programs all across the country. And that is what we are here to talk about, how to make then work better. They are working okay. We want better than okay in America. We want excellence. Windy understands that, and I want to thank her for working with my Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson. I appreciate you coming, Tommy. And I appreciate my friend Rod Paige. He is the Secretary of Education. If you noticed, the two Secretaries are here, Health and Human Services and Education. The idea is to combine both focuses, both Departments into one when it comes to Head Start. The Head Start program will stay under Tommy's purview, but we want it to become an Education Department as well. I mean, after all, you have got a million kids gathered together at one time during the day. If you have got a million kids that may be, as they call them in the education world, at-risk readers, let us get it right early then. That is what we are saying. And that is what this initiative is attempting to do. I appreciate Bob Ehrlich, the Governor of this great State. He knows what he is doing when it comes to education. He is got a great wife, the first lady, Kendel, with us as well. Governor Ehrlich sets high standards. He challenges what I call the soft bigotry of low expectations. He understands if you lower the bar, assign certain kids to failure based upon demographics, that is precisely what you will get in the State of Maryland. So he said, We ought to raise the bar. He believes every child can learn. And so does the Lieutenant Governor, Michael Steele. They understand that high standards will yield high results. And the best place to start in achieving high standards is with the littlest of children. I want to thank very much Congressman John Boehner for coming today. The Congressman is not from Maryland; he is from Ohio. But he is an important figure since he is the chairman of the House Education Committee which is marking up legislation which will help us spread excellence to the Head Start programs all across the country. Congressman, thanks for coming. I look forward to continuing to work with him. He also is one of the authors of what we call the No Child Left Behind Act, which I will talk about a little bit later. But the No Child Left Behind Act essentially says we expect every child to learn, and there is going to be high standards and strong accountability measures to every State in the Union. In return for increased Title I funding and in return for an increase in the Federal budget of elementary and secondary schools act money, we expect results. You see, we are not going to just spend money and hope something positive happens. We are going to spend money and see results. Well, if you believe in high standards and accountability, then it is really important to get the young kids up to the starting line at the same time. And that is why the Head Start reforms we are going to talk about are important, the reforms which John and his committee are carrying to the floor of the House relatively soon. I want to thank Nancy Grasmick, who is the State superintendent of schools in Maryland. I am honored that you are here. Thank you for coming, and thank you for taking on a tough job. I appreciate Andre Hornsby as the superintendent of schools, an even tougher job. Government closest to the people is sometimes government that is the hardest. And I want to thank Guylaine Richard, who is the program director for the Head Start. I appreciate, Guylaine, you opening up this chance for me to come and see a program which works. I want to thank Lori Ellis, the principal. When we leave, she can take a deep breath and relax and say, Thank goodness the entourage has departed. I appreciate the-Tonya Riggins, who is the Highland Park Head Start Center coordinator. I want to thank Lisa Dunmore and Alice Williams, the two fine teachers we had to meet. For the teachers who are here, thank you for doing what you are doing. You are a part of a noble profession, an incredibly important profession for the future of this country. You know what I know, that reading is the key to all learning. It is where you have got to start. And the research-I see some of my friends from the National Research Council, National Institutions of Child Health who are here. Reid Lyon is an expert. He is not a political person. He is a scientist. He understands how the brain works, and he is spent a lot of time analyzing what works and what does not work. He caught my attention when I was the Governor of Texas. I would ask him a question, Are you sure we can teach kids, you know, the so-called impossible-to-teach? He said, Sure, I know it. I am absolutely certain. And so he started doing research to convince the people about the real future. And he says that-he and his fellow researchers-that preschoolers can learn much more than we ever thought possible about words and sounds. In other words, society limited how much a certain-how much a preschooler could learn. At least our imaginations were not very open. It kind of felt like certain things were impossible to-certain knowledge was impossible to impart to our children, particularly the young. And so I want to thank Reid and the good folks who are focusing on science, who have opened up a tremendous realm of possibility now to achieve that which we want, a literate America. He also says there-he and other researchers say, and this is just as important, kids love to learn. They love to learn to read. Even the youngest child can learn that we read words and letters from left to right or that letters are associated with sounds; even the youngest of toddlers can figure that out over time. In one exercise, children clapped for each syllable in a word. They can trace letters on the page to begin to understand the movements we use to write. They can play word games and learn rhymes and songs that help them to develop their own vocabulary. That sounds like a simple curriculum, but it is research-based, all aimed at laying the foundation for children to become good readers. These are what we call the building blocks, and these building blocks need to be a part of Head Start programs all across America. That is the mission. That is the goal. Research also shows that if children do not develop these skills before they reach kindergarten, they will struggle to achieve success in their lives. Now, we need to listen to that kind of research in America. If the scientists come together and say, If we fail in our mission to give children the foundation necessary for reading, they will fall behind and may not be able to develop the skills necessary, so they have to struggle in life, we got a-this is an opportunity that we better not miss. We cannot let our children down. Now look, Head Start is a great opportunity to provide the foundation for reading. And first, I just want everybody to understand, Head Start does a good job of giving children nutrition and medical care. That has been primarily the focus, and the program needs to be applauded for meeting that goal. And nobody in this room wants Head Start to change that focus. We just want an additional focus to Head Start, and the Head Start focus is teaching the basics for reading and math. That is the new focus, along with health and nutrition. The Department of Health and Human Services did a report, and here is what it said: Even though most children in Head Start make some educational progress, most of them still leave the program with skills and knowledge levels that are far below what we expect. Now, in my line of work, if you see a problem, you address it. And I see that as a problem. If we are not meeting expectations, if we are not challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, let us start right now in America. We want Head Start to set higher ambitions for the million children it serves. And so I laid out a plan. Every Head Start center must prepare children to succeed by teaching the basics of learning and literacy. That is the cornerstone of the plan. And every Head Start teacher must have the skills necessary to do so. And so we started last year when we launched the Strategic Teacher Education Program, STEP, to train 3,300 Head Start teachers and supervisors in the C.I.R.C.L.E. program, which is used right here at this school. In other words, it is a go-by. It is a curriculum. It is easy to understand. It is easy to teach. It is easy to implement. It is not a difficult chore for a teacher to take the basic learning from the C.I.R.C.L.E. program developed by the scientists and implement it at the Head Start program in which he or she teaches. Tonya Riggins, the assistant Head Start supervisor at Highland Park, was one of the teachers in the program. Tonya and thousands of other trained teachers went back to train other teachers at the program. So it is going to-we started with 3,300. Those 3,300 went back to their local communities and talked to teachers with whom they teach how to teach a basic curriculum. It is a-and by the way, as new teachers are added, they too will be given the tools necessary to teach the program. Now, in order to make sure that the C.I.R.C.L.E. program is-and other curriculums which work-are being used, is working, I believe there needs to be an evaluation program. And after all, if we are spending a lot of taxpayers' money, which we are, it makes sense to determine whether or not these programs are, in fact, laying the foundation for reading. Now, I fully understand a 4-year-old child is not going to take a standardized test. That would be absurd. That we would-we would be defeating the purpose of accountability before we even began if we said, Okay, we will give standardized tests to 4-year-olds. But we can have children assessed by asking simple questions. You know, words go left to right. Are you able to identify certain sounds? Are they developed by-developing the key skills necessary? And I think what needs to happen is- and I hope Congress agrees-that the simple evaluations at the beginning of the year and the end of the year will tell us whether or not progress is being made in developing a curriculum necessary to teach children how to read. And if they are, we ought to be praising the programs, and if they are not, something else ought to happen. We cannot miss the opportunity much longer in America. Otherwise, children will be left behind. And so Boehner is here because his committee and the Congress is considering legislation that would put a new emphasis on language skills and literacy skills in Head Start programs. In other words, we are going to codify into law that which we have started through the teacher training program. The legislation will require Head Start providers to teach language, reading, and writing skills, as well as early math skills. In other words, it now becomes a part- when they pass the law that says the Head Start mission is further defined as an educational mission. And those programs that are used must be proven by scientific research. The legislation would hold Head Starts accountable for getting the job done. Now look, as I mentioned before, the No Child Left Behind Act says every child can learn. We are going to have high standards. We are going to trust the local people to develop the curriculum, but in return for Federal money, we want you to measure to tell us whether or not children are learning to read and write. And that is a heavy lift for some communities, because there has not been a proper focus on the little children. And therefore, we are asking people to develop an accountability system without everybody being at the same starting position. And that is why it is so important for preschool programs to be focused on literacy, so that when the accountability systems kick in in Maryland or Texas or anybody else, we can truthfully say that every child has been given the tools necessary to be at the starting line at the same time, so that we have true accountability, true measurement. And that is why the Head Start program is important. Now, there is Governors around the State, the country that have said, Look, give us the flexibility to be able to dovetail the Head Start program into our preschool programs so that all students-so we have a better control over whether or not the students are given the skills necessary so that when you hold us to account, we can achieve that which we want to achieve, which is excellence in the classroom. I appreciate the desire for flexibility. I support the Governors' desire for flexibility so long as, one, Federal monies going to the States are used only for Head Start. In other words, what we really do not want to do is say we are going to focus on Head Start; the Head Start money goes for, you know, a prison complex. I know that will not happen with Governor Ehrlich, but there needs to be a guarantee that the Federal money spent on Head Start only go to Head Start. Secondly, States and local governments must put money into the program, which would lock in the Head Start money for Head Start. So, in other words, the flexibility given to the State would not allow the States budget flexibility. It is management flexibility to be able to take the Head Start program, dovetail into the preschool program, then the kindergarten program, and then into the elementary school program. Governors ought to have that flexibility to-hope that Congress will provide that flexibility so that when the accountability systems kick in, fully kick in, that a Governor can truthfully say, Well, I have had the tools necessary to make sure the Head Start program fits into an overall comprehensive plan for literacy and math for every child in the State of Maryland, in Governor Ehrlich's case. This is a very important initiative I am talking about. It is-it seems like to me a fantastic opportunity for the country to make sure that the desires of this country are met, and that is, every child become a good reader. If reading is the new civil right and human dignity and freedom is what this country is all about, let us make sure every child learns to read. So I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come today. We know what works. We have got the pros and the experts that have laid out a curriculum that will help us achieve a goal. We have got a million kids anxious to learn, showing up on a daily basis at Head Start programs all across the country. We have got teachers who want to teach. We are writing the checks for the local governments and the local Head Start programs. Let us combine it all into a comprehensive strategy that will allow us all to say, We have done our duty for future generations of children by laying the most important foundation of all, and that is the ability for each child to learn to read. I know it can happen. There is no doubt in my mind. I want to thank those of you who are working on the frontlines of education. I appreciate your willingness to accept a new mission to be incorporated with the old mission. And I appreciate your willingness to work hard, to see to it that not one single child in America is left behind. May God bless your work. And may God continue to bless America. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 655, "text": "Congresswoman Holt asked me how I knew all the names. I know a lot more about you all than you think I do. This morning I will be signing a proclamation to implement the terms of the registration act that the Congress recently passed. I would like to say at the beginning that this is a very wise decision that the Congress has made. And I would like to emphasize that the registration act-which has now been passed and will go into effect-is not to threaten war, but is to preserve peace. The action taken by our country and almost all other nations in the democratic world is designed to preserve peace. We are deeply concerned about the unwarranted and vicious invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and occupation by them of this innocent and defenseless country, which is completely unwarranted. We have taken a series of steps-economic, diplomatic, political, military steps-in order to convince the Soviet Union that their action is ill advised and, of course, encouraging them to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and also to prevent further aggression if they should be tempted to do so. All of the action we have taken is peaceful in nature, and we will stay committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes. The freedom-fighters in Afghanistan, who are striving for the liberation of their country, deserve the admiration of the entire world, and their courage and persistence in fighting for freedom is the greatest single deterrent to the Soviet aggression being successful. I would like to emphasize that the registration act is not a draft; I am not in favor of a peacetime draft. This registration act will do a great deal to marshal our own Nation's resistance to succumbing to temptation which might lead to war, and therefore lead to a mandatory draft. The only time that I envision a mandatory draft law being advocated to the Congress would be in time of war or in time of national emergency, and in a case of that kind, when our Nation's security is threatened, separate legal action would be required by Congress, a separate law, to initiate a draft under those circumstances. I might say that we will continue to rely on voluntary enlistment by the military forces to defend our country. As a matter of fact, in the 1981 budget and through legislation initiated by some of the Members of Congress behind me, and by us, we will add approximately $1 billion to the military budget, to encourage additional enlistment of highly qualified young men and women, and also to make retention of those highly trained military personnel more effective. In closing, let me say that following the signing of this proclamation, young men who were born in 1960 and in 1961 will be required to register at the post offices in their local communities. This will not mean that they are being drafted. It means that we are expediting the process by which, if our Nation enters a time of emergency or a threat to our national security or a time of war in the future, the marshaling of our defense mechanisms can be expedited. It is a precautionary measure; it is designed to make our country strong and to maintain peace. I would like to ask the support of all Americans for this move: Americans in the age that will be registered and Americans of all ages who believe in a strong country, who believe in patriotism, who believe in maintaining peace through strength. At this time I'd like to sign the proclamation that will implement the registration act. And I'd like to express my thanks to the Members of Congress who have wisely and courageously passed this law. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningproclamation4771registrationunderthemilitaryselectiveserviceact", "title": "Remarks on Signing Proclamation 4771 on Registration Under the Military Selective Service Act", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-proclamation-4771-registration-under-the-military-selective-service-act", "publication_date": "02-07-1980", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 862, "text": "Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Cuomo, honored guests, families of the fallen: In those awful moments after the South Tower was hit, some of the injured huddled in the wreckage of the 78th floor. The fires were spreading. The air was filled with smoke. It was dark, and they could barely see. It seemed as if there was no way out. And then there came a voice: clear, calm, saying he had found the stairs. A young man in his twenties, strong, emerged from the smoke, and over his nose and his mouth, he wore a red handkerchief. He called for fire extinguishers to fight back the flames. He tended to the wounded. He led those survivors down the stairs to safety and carried a woman on his shoulders down 17 flights. And then, he went back, back up all those flights, then back down again, bringing more wounded to safety. Until that moment when the tower fell. They did not know his name. They did not know where he came from. But they knew their lives had been saved by the man in the red bandana. Again, Mayor Bloomberg; distinguished guests; Mayor de Blasio; Governors Christie and Cuomo; and the families and survivors of that day; to all those who responded with such courage: On behalf of Michelle and myself and the American people, it is an honor for us to join in your memories. To recall and to reflect. But above all, to reaffirm the true spirit of 9/11 love, compassion, sacrifice and to enshrine it forever in the heart of our Nation. Michelle and I just had the opportunity to join with others on a visit with some of the survivors and families, men and women who inspire us all. And we had a chance to visit some of the exhibits. And I think all who come here will find it to be a profound and moving experience. I want to express our deep gratitude to everybody who was involved in this great undertaking: for bringing us to this day, for giving us this sacred place of healing and of hope. Here, at this memorial, this museum, we come together. We stand in the footprints of two mighty towers, graced by the rush of eternal waters. We look into the faces of nearly 3,000 innocent souls, men and women and children of every race, every creed, from every corner of the world. And we can touch their names and hear their voices and glimpse the small items that speak to the beauty of their lives: a wedding ring, a dusty helmet, a shining badge. Here we tell their story so that generations yet unborn will never forget: of coworkers who led others to safety; passengers who stormed a cockpit; our men and women in uniform who rushed into an inferno; our first responders who charged up those stairs; a generation of servicemembers our 9/11 generation who have served with honor in more than a decade of war. A nation that stands tall and united and unafraid, because no act of terror can match the strength or the character of our country. Like the great wall and bedrock that embrace us today, nothing can ever break us; nothing can change who we are as Americans. On that September morning, Alison Crowther lost her son Welles. Months later, she was reading the newspaper, an article about those final minutes in the towers. Survivors recounted how a young man wearing a red handkerchief had led them to safety. And in that moment, Alison knew. Ever since he was a boy, her son had always carried a red handkerchief. Her son Welles was the man in the red bandana. Welles was just 24 years old, with a broad smile and a bright future. He worked in the South Tower on the 104th floor. He had a big laugh, a joy of life, and dreams of seeing the world. He worked in finance, but he had also been a volunteer firefighter. And after the planes hit, he put on that bandana and spent his final moments saving others. Three years ago this month, after our SEALs made sure that justice was done, I came to Ground Zero. And among the families here that day was Alison Crowther. And she told me about Welles and his fearless spirit, and she showed me a handkerchief like the one he wore that morning. And today, as we saw on our tour, one of his red handkerchiefs is on display in this museum. And from this day forward, all those who come here will have a chance to know the sacrifice of a young man who, like so many, gave his life so others might live. Those we lost live on in us: in the families who love them still, in the friends who remember them always, and in a nation that will honor them, now and forever. And today it is my honor to introduce two women forever bound by that day, united in their determination to keep alive the true spirit of 9/11: Welles Crowther's mother Alison and one of those he saved, Ling Young.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalseptember11memorialmuseumdedicationceremonynewyorkcity", "title": "Remarks at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum Dedication Ceremony in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-september-11-memorial-museum-dedication-ceremony-new-york-city", "publication_date": "15-05-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 641, "text": "Thank you very, very much. Michael, thank you and all the others at the Chamber. Thank you for that introduction. Let me just explain what Michael was talking about. There has been this hurricane down in Florida, and so we leave right from here to go down to Newark, take the plane, and head on down to look at that damage and express our concerns to the people there. But I am just delighted to be here. A warm reception coming into town. I want to thank David Rifkin and especially the Mayor Thomas Hallihan. Let me also mention an old friend and a good man, Gary Franks, who is the Congressman here. I am so indebted to him. And another that you all know so well in this valley, John Rowland, he is a great man, and I want to see him do more. I was touched by the Reverend Father Weiss' invocation. And I want to ask today that we now take a little political look ahead to the fall. I will tell you something. I came out of that Houston convention, and the whole spirit around this country is different. I am determined to win this election, and I am determined to do it fair and square. If I had not been fired up when I walked in here, the Company, that great music, would have got it going, I will tell you. That was fantastic. I do not even know where they are. But anyway, we are looking ahead to a great classic that takes place this fall. I am not talking about Ansonia versus Derby -- -- I am talking about the November 3d contest. That does have a lot to do with the direction of this country and also the new century beyond. I heard my grandson speak at our convention, and I was so very proud of that young kid. It just reminded me on a very personal basis of what the Reverend Father was talking about and the job that lies ahead of us, to make life better for all. Now, we have witnessed, as I pointed out down there, a world of change from Managua to Moscow. Millions of men and women now turn towards freedom. They are celebrating a new birth of freedom. I believe people right here in the valley, many of whom came here from other countries, many of whose family came here, understand what I am talking about when I say this Nation can take pride in the freedom of others. Many right in this room, because of family, not just because of freedom and democracy, because of family, prayed for this day of freedom to come to Eastern Europe, to Russia, to the countries south of our border. We have witnessed this remarkable change, and this miracle has come true. So now the challenge for this country is to bring that spirit home from Warsaw, Poland, to Warsaw Park and to focus this great Nation on the mission ahead. We have literally changed the world with the help of the taxpayer, Presidents that preceded me, fighting men and women that have served this great country with distinction. We have changed the world, and now we must change America for the better. Our challenge quite simply is to win the global economic challenge, to win the peace, be a military superpower, an economic superpower, an export superpower. In this election you are going to hear two very different visions of how to do this. Theirs is to turn inward and protect; and ours is to look outward and open new markets and prepare our people to compete, to restore social fabric, to save and invest. When I am talking about investment, I do not mean more taxpayer money going into Government investment. I mean more private investment, small business investment. I do not want to get too personal in this wonderful area that I understand has some wonderfully smart Democrats, because I need you guys in the fall. But let me say this, that my opponent has spent most of his adult life in government, and that is pretty much, I think, all he knows about. But his idea about creating jobs is to have Government jobs, public payroll jobs. And I come at things a different way. I spent, I computed it the other day, half of my adult life in government service, one kind or another, and half in the private sector. Long before I was in the public sector, I worked for a living out in the oilfields of west Texas, built a company, and did what many here has in small or larger operations, I met a payroll. I took risks, and I made it work. I happen to think having held a job is not a bad qualification even for ENTITY. Look, the world economy is changing, and we have got to be in the lead of that change. Think of the economic changes you have seen right here in Ansonia, from moving from that brass and copper age in the mills along the Naugatuck to the new corporate headquarters in the industrial parks across the valley. Right now one in every six American manufacturing jobs is tied directly to exports. That does not count the economic ripple effect created when those workers pay mortgages or buy a car or feed the kids. Since '88, since 1988, three-fifths of the economic growth has come from people in other countries buying what we do best, the products we make right here in America. We are the best manufacturers in the world, and do not let anybody tell you, do not you let that gloomy opposition tell you we cannot compete or say that we are a nation in decline. We are not. As President, I am working now to create jobs, new markets, markets in Moscow, markets in Mexico City that mean new American jobs. I am convinced that the answer is not to build a wall around our economy, not to put the Government in charge but to use the Government to help you literally go back to work in this country. That is what I want to tell you, how I am going to do it. Here are some of what we stand for: open markets for American products. Here is one we have a big difference on: lower Government spending and tax relief, not spend and tax; tax relief and less Federal Government spending. And the other one is opportunities for small business. We have got to do better getting the regulatory burden off the back of these mom-and-pop, these small operators. We are going to keep doing it until we get that job done. You know my feeling about too many lawsuits in this country. I have been fighting to change that, blocked by this gridlocked Congress. We sue each other too much. We care for each other too little. We have got to break the back of those that are breaking this country with these damn lawsuits. New schools -- and I know we have got some teachers here, and God bless them. But I will tell you something. We need new schools to back up these teachers, new ideas. Our whole program, America 2000, is a good program to literally revolutionize how we bring our kids into the next century. It is exciting program. I might say, we have got to win this fight on narcotics. Teenage use of cocaine is down, but we have just begun to fight. We have got to win it, clean out these schoolyards. You know, a big difference is, a big one, I do believe that they are too big in Government and spend too much. Last week I offered an idea to get the deficit down. We will give you a special box -- I believe that people should have it -- a special box on that tax return to check so that up to 10 percent of your income tax can go for one purpose, and that is to reduce the budget deficit. If Congress does not like it -- all these editorials that you read around here on some of these sophisticated journals do not like it -- but the Congress has failed to do it. So let us get the people a chance to check that box, and then we have to live with it. Then there is something that is very important to the valley that I talked about today in Union, New Jersey, a dramatic new approach to job training: To help young people find that first job, a program we call the Youth Training Corps, to get inner-city kids off the mean streets and get them a second chance to build the skills they need to succeed. For older workers who have lost their job or worry that next pay envelope may have a pink slip, we have developed a new concept called skill grants, vouchers worth $3,000 to be used towards the training program of their choice. Our plan is based on empowering people to get the kind of training they want, not empowering the bureaucracies to hire more people. That is a very different approach than the approach the others are taking toward job training. The Governor of Arkansas says he is all for free enterprise. Then he proposes right out of the box the largest tax increase in history, much of it on the back of small business. I learned the hard way, holding out my hand to that gridlocked Congress, and they bit it off. Once you make one mistake you do not make it again. I am not going to go forward and go with this program of spending and taxes. We have literally proposed, and it is before Congress right now, eliminating over 200 programs and 4,000 projects. It is there; it is put down in detail. It is before this gridlocked Congress. We have got to do something about changing the Congress. If we had more people like Gary Franks, we would not have a gridlock problem. But the Congress has been controlled, they have been controlled by the same party for 38 years. Everything else has changed in the country; not the House of Representatives. Help me change the House. Clean it. Clean the House. My opponent says he is for fiscal responsibility. He is against a balanced budget amendment. Says he is for a line-item veto, but the gridlocked Congress refuses to give it to ENTITY. I stand for something different. I want to see us cut that Federal spending with the help of a new Congress, get the taxes down so we can get the economy stimulated and let people keep a little more of what they earn. It is a big philosophical difference between the Bush-Quayle ticket on the one hand and Clinton-Gore on the other. Look at it. It is fundamentally different. Now, in this campaign, we have got to call it as we see it. This year I believe the choice is very clear. We have got two different, fundamentally different approaches. I believe in the Government. You get all this talk: Government, Government, of the Government, by the Government, for the Government. That is not going to get the job done. We are fighting against that because we happen to believe still that the power should flow from the people, so it is of the people, by the people, and for the people. Really, what is at stake here is the future of this country. We are in choppy waters. I heard the Reverend. I know it. People that are hurting and cannot find jobs when they need it. I will tell you another area we have got a big difference: on the defense spending. I have cut defense, but we are not going to cut into the muscle of the defense. The other side wants to take $60 billion more than Colin Powell and Cheney tell me is the right level. We still have a tough world out there. We must still be strong. While you are thinking about it, we do not needlessly need to throw another million defense workers out of work by cutting back on defense below the levels needed for national security. Let me just tell you, I wish Barbara Bush were here. This would be great for her morale. This would be great for her spirits. But I will tell you something. I want to be serious about this one point. When I drove in here today -- and I have been here as some of you know many, many times. My dad was a Senator from this State, and we grew up down the way. Leave out the politics for just a minute. When I came in here this morning, a lot of the people out there were waving. I am sure they were not for me. They were there because I am privileged to be the President of the United States of America. But you sense something else out there along the highway. You sense this community feeling and this feeling of family. I want to tell you something. The cynics, the liberal theoreticians, they can ridicule me all they want when I talk about family values. But this one transcends Democrat. It transcends Republican. It gets to the heart of what our community is about. The community has been diminished by the decimation and sometimes the decline of the American family. I saw it today, that family spirit is still strong. And I just want to pledge to you, I am not going to get off talking about that because we must find ways -- whether it is welfare reform, whether it is making the fathers that run away stay there, whether it is helping, as Barbara does, hold someone in the arms to demonstrate the compassion and love we feel for our fellow man -- we have got to find ways to strengthen the American family. It is not demagoguery. It is fundamental to America. She and I will continue to try to do our level-best to set a level of decency and honor and, hopefully, trust there in the Oval Office and there in the White House. Thank you very much for this wonderful reception. May God bless the Naugatuck Valley, and may God bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthechambercommerceansoniaconnecticut", "title": "Remarks to the Chamber of Commerce in Ansonia, Connecticut", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-chamber-commerce-ansonia-connecticut", "publication_date": "24-08-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 892, "text": "It is a pleasure to be here today at the first Italian-American Conference on Private Sector Initiatives. Yesterday we concluded this year's economic summit. I looked around that table at the leaders of some of the world's great democracies, and I could not help thinking how precious our common heritage is. It was a great Italian who said, the natural rights of personality, family, and society exist before the state. Those words, spoken by an Italian, are as American as the Declaration of Independence-for that matter, as British as the Common Law and as French as the writings of Montesquieu. They could be called the common credo of every democratic nation across the Earth. Yet if freedom, democracy, and the rights of man are to be preserved through the ages, free men and women must accept the responsibilities that go with their freedoms. And this is why I wanted to take some time out after the summit to meet with you, because as business men and women, as citizens, you have been leaders in taking up the responsibilities of liberty. Again and again, over the years, all of you have volunteered yourselves and your corporations to causes that have helped make life better for the people of both Italy and America and of people all over the world. When you have seen a need to be filled, a job to be done, you have not waited for government to lead the way; you have set out and got the work done yourselves. And let me say that we can see all around us testimony to the strength here in Italy of voluntarism and of private giving, of what we in America sometimes call private sector initiatives. It was a private sector initiative by Fiat that restored this magnificent building, the Palazzo Grassi. And just down the Grand Canal are the noble horses of St. Mark's Basilica, which through an initiative by Olivetti have toured the world, showing something of the beauty of Venice to many who will not have the opportunity to come to this great city. Yes, in country after country, private sector initiatives are teaching children, caring for the sick, helping the poor build better lives for themselves, and searching for ways to cure disease. Whether people are in sickness, sorrow, or in need, private sector initiatives have been created to answer the call. Last November in Paris, at the International Conference on Private Sector Initiatives, men and women from seven nations showed that yours is an international movement. Yesterday in Milan you continued the work you began in Paris with a new exchange of ideas. In the meantime, of course, I have been meeting here in Venice with the leaders of the six leading industrial democracies. We have held productive discussions on subjects ranging from East-West relations to terrorism to economic policy and free trade. These meetings are important, and they have received, as they should, a great deal of attention from the press. And yet I cannot help thinking that any true history of our times will show that your work, and that of millions of free men and women all around the world, has done as much to build the future of our civilization as have all the statesmen in all the summits over the years. History has shown that governments alone cannot possibly meet the challenges of a growing world. I believe that private sector initiatives will provide many solutions to the challenges of the 21st century. They are already giving us lasting symbols of the friendships between democratic peoples and countries on which European and American peace and prosperity have been built over the last 40 years. In this regard, I am pleased to commend the National Italian-American Foundation for their efforts in restoring a magnificent garden here in Venice. This Italian-American Friendship Garden will be a lasting reminder of this meeting in Venice. And Jim Robinson has just announced another step in Italian-American friendship. This innovative program will contribute to the restoration of other Italian national treasures. It is a fine example of private sector initiatives at work. I want to thank all those involved in these projects as well as the members of my board of advisors on private sector initiatives and their Italian counterparts, who have made this conference possible. By shouldering the responsibilities of freedom, you are helping to preserve freedom, to preserve this great hope for all mankind that our countries represent. And the voices that thank you come not just from Italy and America, not just from Europe, but from throughout the world. And Frank, I have to tell you, in giving me this honor, which you have just given me, kind of makes things all right for the industry that I once was in, the motion picture industry. We had an actor there who was only being an actor in Hollywood long enough to get the money to come to Italy, because he aspired to an operatic career. And he went to Milan, and he studied. And then he was asked to sing in Pagliacci, the very spiritual fountainhead of opera. And he did an aria, and he received such thunderous and sustained applause that he had to repeat the aria as an encore. And again the same sustained, thunderous applause, and again he sang Vesti la Giubba. And this went on until finally he motioned for quiet, and he tried to tell them how full his heart was for this reception. But, he said, I have sung 'Vesti la Giubba' now nine times. My voice is gone; I cannot do it again. And a voice from the balcony said, You will do it until you get it right. You know, all that we talked about, I just have to tell you one last little incident here that is really true of what brings us together here-private initiative. I am sure that our people have told you that there in Washington now, we have in the computers some 3,000 programs where some little hamlet or village or town has found a problem and a way to solve it themselves. And we keep this, because then when inquiries come from people that say what could we do about it, we go to the computers and are able to tell them how a program was set up privately by the people and made to work. A little town in Texas had something for several years called Christmas in April. All year long the people of that town kept track and watched for homes of elderly people or homes of people that were handicapped or very poor; and if there were things like leaking roofs and plumbing that did not work and so forth, they made a list during all the year. And then on April 1st the merchants that dealt in the products they needed-building materials and paint and so forth-would donate. But citizens of every calling, as volunteers, would show up on that April 1st, knock on the door, and say we are here to put a new roof on your house or paint your house or fix the plumbing or do what has to be done. That went on in that little town in Texas. Well, a couple of years ago, I was amazed to see some people that did not look like ordinary workmen in Washington, DC, nailing shingles on a roof and others painting a porch and so forth. I recognized a couple of judges among them. There were some professional people, some medical personnel and all. Believe it or not, Washington, DC, had discovered from that little town in Texas private initiative, and now had Christmas in April for the people, the poor that might be there in the Capital. So, what is ahead for all of you, I think you are going to find, is most exciting, most wonderful, and just a blessing of freedom that a number of people in the world cannot have unless they see the error of their ways and turn to our way of life. Thank you all. God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheitalianamericanconferenceprivatesectorinitiativesveniceitaly", "title": "Remarks at the Italian-American Conference on Private Sector Initiatives in Venice, Italy", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-italian-american-conference-private-sector-initiatives-venice-italy", "publication_date": "11-06-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 781, "text": "This is what they call a cameo appearance. I am here very briefly before rushing off to the Hilton Hotel, but I just cannot tell you how pleased I am to be with you. I told Abe Foxman here, Why, we are practically going steady! Because he was down here just last -- was it Thursday of last week with the head of a lot of these most prominent organizations. And I am delighted to be here with all of you today. I do not want to speak too long because Bobbie Kilberg, I think, is next, and she will kill me. But I might say she is doing an outstanding job -- a friend of longstanding and now in an outreach capacity here, high level at the White House, and performing with the expertise that we have come to expect of her. I understand that Secretary Kemp is coming, or maybe -- has he been, or coming over -- and Dick Thornburgh, I think, and our Chief of Staff. So, you will have a full program. But I am pleased to be here. I look at these briefing sessions as a two-way street. I hope that you will have a chance to exchange views, get questions and answers with some -- but in any event, an opinion at a forum for sharing of information and ideas. Certainly, the meeting that we had with Abe and those from the organization of presidents was that kind of meeting. And as I look around the room, I see many familiar faces and am delighted to be here. For three quarters of a century, the Anti-Defamation League has played a central role in preserving and protecting that sacred right of religious freedom. And there is no single greater contribution that one organization can make to the Nation, and for that you have earned our gratitude, certainly my respect. From the time the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, the principle of religious freedom and the notion of America as a haven for those who seek to exercise that freedom has been deeply rooted in the American heritage. But the ADL knows well that, however well-established religious freedom may be, it can never be taken for granted. And our national conscience must take note whenever that freedom is violated, and all Americans then must rush in to the defense of that freedom. As one of our forefathers wrote nearly 200 years ago, the Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance. May the children of the stock of Abraham sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there should be none to make him afraid. I know that the ADL recently issued its annual report, detailing rising incidents of anti-Semitism in 1988. And I want to come over here to tell you that we must condemn all attacks on the Jewish religion, the Jewish heritage -- clearly, unequivocally, and without exception. This Nation must stand for tolerance, for pluralism, and a healthy respect for the rights of all minorities. And I know many of you, and we have worked together in various common causes many times over the years, and I hope you know how deeply I cherish the principle of religious freedom. And I know how hard you have fought not only for your own beliefs but to protect the principle that recognizes the rights of all men and women to worship as they believe right. So, we must continue to work together as we have in the past to zealously protect these rights for all Americans. Rest assured that my administration will work to uphold this principle as the very cornerstone of our freedom. And sometimes they question the power of the President, and I understand that. But they should never question the President's willingness to use the bully pulpit of the White House, as Teddy Roosevelt called it, to speak out for what is just and right. I have concentrated today here on just these brief remarks on antidiscrimination or other subjects of enormous concern. I wish you could have been there yesterday in the Oval Office to hear a representative of the Ethiopian Jews, a man who is living in Israel now, make this plea from the heart to continue the flow of the people there who are still not able to join their families in Israel. There is that subject. We had a fascinating meeting with Mr. Arens yesterday where I reassured him of the United States commitment to Israel as a strategic ally and, of course, a lasting friend. And I think he understands that. I hope that when the Prime Minister of Israel comes here that we can move forward in some way toward the peace that everybody here really hopes that Israel and its neighbors will achieve. So, we are moving. Thank you for letting me drop in in this cameo appearance. And keep up your commitment, keep up that commitment to fight against bigotry wherever it may surface.

{"id": 980, "text": "Well, it is good once again to be with my friend, Prime Minister Abe, and the Japanese delegation. We have been able to forge, I think, an excellent relationship on a whole host of issues and this gives us an opportunity to continue to discuss both our security cooperation and our economic cooperation. The United States-Japanese alliance is one of the linchpins of our security as well as Japan's, and this gives us an opportunity to continue to deepen that relationship, building off the discussions we have had in Washington. It includes the realignment in Okinawa. I want to congratulate Prime Minister Abe on his recent legislation related to bolstering Japanese defense capabilities, and it will give us a chance to talk about a wide range of threats, both regionally and internationally. I also want to express my appreciation for the hard work that Shinzo has been involved with in building up stronger regional understandings. The trilateral meetings that have been taking place between Japan, China, and South Korea I think are especially important. And Shinzo and I both share an interest in continuing to foster rule of law, supporting international norms in areas like navigation-freedom of navigation and maritime law. And again, this bilateral gives us an opportunity to examine how we can work with some of the regional organizations like ASEAN in order to continue to maintain the stability and-that has been the hallmark of this region and has allowed for extraordinary prosperity and growth. And finally, we will be discussing a wide range of economic issues coming out of our meeting at the G-20. Both of us are interested in ratifying and implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has been a major topic of conversation here at APEC and the G-20. There is a recognition that these kinds of high-standard rules that provide enforceable protections for labor and the environment are the wave of the future and could not have been done without Shinzo's leadership. We will also be talking about the climate change conference in Paris, and the importance of all of us working together in order to achieve a strong agreement that can protect the planet for future generations.

{"id": 737, "text": "I am very grateful to all of you for your kind words and for this magnificent gift. We will have a conflict in registration, because we no longer use the branding iron in our country except as ornaments or in our museums. But we now write the numbers on the horns of our cattle instead of placing the brand on their hip. I have collected some of the irons dating back to my grandfather's day, when he used to drive the cattle up the trail from Johnson City to Abilene. I do not think there was any particular significance to that in those days. But it is interesting that they went from Johnson City to Abilene and I now go out to Walter Reed to see the gentleman from Abilene a good deal. There is a great deal of iron beneath the gold of your gift and I find that symbolic of the purpose that we all share. All across this Nation of ours, there are people good people, prudent people, patriotic people-who know what it means to work and to save and to get ahead. Those people buy savings bonds and Freedom Shares. They hold on to them, because they know it is good for them and good for their country. For 27 years now, we have seen the people's prosperity and the savings bonds program grow hand in hand. So as we meet here this morning, we see a remarkable total of more than $52 billion outstanding that is owned by millions of Americans in all walks of life. Now, I do have a personal problem. I made a commitment to myself to buy a savings bond every month as long as I could, for my grandson. Now I have another grandchild coming up. And I am going to have to make another commitment. That is going to involve some problems, because I am going to be out of a job on January 20. I will be out of a job, but I will have another commitment. So I may have to go see Secretary Fowler, who handled monetary problems so well for me, to get his help and judgment on how I can keep up my commitments. But I am going to keep them up, because I believe that you business and labor leaders and 'professional men who have made your own commitments are delivering a great service for this country. We ask some 4 1/2 million people to serve us in the Defense Establishment of this Nation, to give their all and a good many of them give their lives. I just saw a story about a young Marine lieutenant, a son of a general, out at Danang, who had lost both legs in a booby mine while he was there protecting your freedom and trying to serve your national interests. If they can go through the horrors of hell in order to protect freedom in our land, the least we can do is to sacrifice enough to try to make a little investment in a Freedom Share or savings bond. I wish that not only every one of those 4 1/2 million people in the service and I believe incidentally they have about the best record of any group for buying savings bonds but I wish every one of the 200 million Americans could, not only for their country's sake but their own sake, arrange a systematical method of saving and investing to help their Nation with its financial problems. To each of you individually, I express my personal appreciation and my gratitude. I hope I will not have to sell that iron to keep up my commitment. But it seems like it would buy several baby bonds itself. I thank you for giving me a very delightful memento before I leave.

{"id": 897, "text": "Mr. President, Senora, President o/the Permanent Commission o/the Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, the foreign Minister, ladies and gentlemen. I want to express our very warm appreciation to you for your presence here today. First, I would like to express our thanks to the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, who are giving up their summer by spending their tour in Mexico. Those kinds of sacrifices should be appreciated. Do you want to stand up and we will applaud. We want to thank you very much. First, I want to say that I have been speaking through some extraordinary, in fact, both my wife and myself have been speaking through some very gifted interpreters in the last 24 hours to the people of this city and country, and we want to express ourselves more directly to them. After some debate and protest, it was decided that I would not make the speech in Spanish, but, instead, that Mrs. Kennedy would say a few words in behalf of both of us. So, ladies and gentlemen, Senora Kennedy. Ladies and gentlemen, if anyone wishes that speech to be translated, they should call Ambassador Mann on the phone on Monday morning, and he will give the whole thing. I want to express our very warm thanks to all of you and through you to the people of Mexico. I had not realized how radical was the Mexican Revolution until I heard its slogan, which was Universal Suffrage, No Re-election. We have a good deal in common, but I am glad to say not everything. I also realize that there are many who feel that state visits are really in a sense parades, and the people are there, and the noise, and the parade passes, and then there is wind and dust and confetti, and days go on as they were before. But I am not sure that is altogether true. This visit, it seems to me, has had three very definite results. In the first place, it has given me a chance to meet your distinguished President, and, therefore, in the future, on those matters which concern our countries-and there must be many, because we have great interests in common, and we have a common concern for the welfare of this hemisphere--it will be so much easier for us to work together for the common cause. And, therefore, for that reason alone this visit has been most rewarding to us in the United States, and I hope to Mexico. The second great advantage is that it has turned the attention of the United States Government, all of us, the Secretary of State, Senator Mansfield, the Majority Leader, those of us who work with a good many matters which pour across any President's desk or any political leader's desk--it has turned the attention of the United States Government, this visit, 'very directly to those matters which are of mutual concern to Mexico and the United States. So that I regard this visit as most useful and fruitful for that reason alone. We are far more conscious than we have been in the past of the necessity of maintaining those relations which really make, in a very true sense, good neighbors, and I think that this has been most educational for us, and I hope in that sense also useful to the Government of Mexico. And third and last, both my wife and 1, and I think all members of the Government and all those Americans who came with us, go back with an extraordinary sense not only of the warmth and friendship of the people of this city and country but also the vitality and life and vigor and sense of hope and sense of future which marks so much the American people and, I believe, the people of Mexico. This is really the most important quality of all, a sense not of resignation but a sense of participation in the great movements of history of this country. And it is that impression that I will carry with me, not only as long as I am ENTITY but also always of this city and country. Muy muchas gracias, amigos. I ask all of you to join in drinking with me to the very good life of the people of Mexico, and the very good health of the President of Mexico and his charming wife.

{"id": 740, "text": "Dr. Cahill, I thank you and all those who are responsible for this great honor. And I want to say that I happen to know that there is one among us here who has known, also, today, the same joy and even greater, if possible, than I could feel. And that is Dr. Cahill, himself, who this morning was presented by Cardinal Cooke, on behalf of the Pope, the Grand Cross Pro Merito Melitensi. He is the first American to ever receive this award. Your Eminence, the other clergy here at the head table, the other distinguished guests, and one in particular that I might pick out and mention, Teddy Gleason of the International Longshoremen's Association. And I mention him because on Sunday he is going to celebrate the 42d anniversary of his 39th birthday. Teddy, I have found that for some time, that makes it much easier to greet each one of these annual occasions. But I do thank you very much. You know, there is the legend in Ireland of the happy colleen of Ballisodare who lived gaily among the wee people, the tiny people, for 7 years, and then when she came home discovered that she had no toes. She had danced them off. I feel happy enough-when I get home tonight I am going to count mine. Nancy is sorry that she could not be here, and so am I. She sent her warm regards and her regrets. Unfortunately, on the last trip into town she picked up the bug. Now, I am happy to say that is not a situation for me, like the two sons of Ireland, who were in the pub one evening and one asked the other about his wife. And he said, Oh, she is terribly sick. He said, She is terribly ill. And the other one says, Oh, I am sorry to hear that. But he said, Is there any danger? Oh, he said, No. She is too weak to be dangerous anymore. A writer for the Irish press who was based in Washington, a correspondent for the press there, stated to me the other day or stated the other day about me-that I have only recently developed a pride in my Irish heritage or background, and that up till now I have had an apathy about it. Well, let me correct the record. That is not so. I have been troubled until fairly recently about a lack of knowledge about my father's history. My father was orphaned at age 6. He knew very little about his family history. And so I grew up knowing nothing more beyond him than an old photograph, a single photo that he had of his mother and father, and no knowledge of that family history. But somehow, a funny thing happened to me on the way to Washington. When I changed my line of work about a year ago, it seemed that I became of a certain interest to people in Ireland, who very kindly began to fill me in. And so I have learned that my great grandfather took off from the village of Ballyporeen in County Tipperary to come to America. And that is not the limit to all that I have learned about that. Some years ago, when I was just beginning in Hollywood in the motion picture business, I had been sentenced for the few years I'd been there to movies that the studio did not want good, it wanted them Thursday. And then came that opportunity that every actor asks for or hopes for, and that was a picture that was going to be made and the biography of the late Knute Rockne, the great immortal coach of Notre Dame. Pat O'Brien was to play Rockne. And there was a part in there that from my own experience as a sports announcer I had long dreamed of, the part of George Gip. And generously, Pat O'Brien, who was then a star at the studio, held out his hand to a young aspiring actor, and I played Gip. Pat playing Rockne, he himself will say, was the high point of his theatrical career. My playing The Gip opened the door to stardom and a better kind of picture. I have been asked at times, What is it like to see yourself in the old movies, the reruns on TV? It is like looking at a son you never knew you had. But I found out in learning about my own heritage, going back to Ballyporeen that, believe it or not, what a small world it is, Pat O'Brien's family came from Ballyporeen. But I have been filled-in much more since. An historian has informed me that our family was one of the four tribes of Tara, and that from the year 200 until about 900 A.D., they defended the only pass through the Slieve Bloom Mountains. They held it for all those centuries and adopted the motto, The Hills Forever. And that, too, is strange, because for the better part of 9 months now, I have been saying much the same thing, only in the singular: The Hill Forever. Capitol Hill, that is. I do remember my father telling me once when I was a boy, and with great pride he said to me, The Irish are the only people in the country, in America, that built the jails and then filled them. I was a little perturbed even then, at that tender age, because at the sound of pride in his voice and from the way I'd been raised, I could not quite understand why that was something to be proud of, until I then later learned, which he had never explained to me, that he was referring to the fact that the overwhelming majority of men wearing the blue of the police department in America were of Irish descent. You know, those were not the only jobs that were open to the Irish. Back in the high day of vaudeville, long before sound pictures drove it out, there were, very popular in this country, comedians who would reach great stardom in vaudeville with a broad German accent. German comedians coming on Ach und Himmel Sic der. What is little known in show business is that almost without exception, they were Irish. Their wit and humor that made them comedians, they came by naturally and honestly. I was on a mission to England for our government some 10 years ago. I should say to Europe, to several countries, and finally wound up and the last country was Ireland. On the last day in Ireland, I was taken to Cashel Rock. I did not know at that time that it is only 25 miles from Ballyporeen. But I do know that the young Irish guide who was showing us around the ruins of the ancient cathedral, there on the rock, finally took us to the little cemetery. We walked with great interest and looked at those ancient tombstones and the inscriptions. And then we came to one and the inscription said: Remember me as you pass by, for as you are, so once was I. But as I am, you too will be, so be content to follow me. And that was too much for the Irish wit and humor of someone who came after, because underneath was scratched: To follow you I am content, I wish I knew which way you went. But the Irish, like many, a great many of the people and like my grandfather, great-grandfather, were driven to the New World by famine and by tragedies of other kinds. The Irish they built the railroads, they opened the West wearing the blue and gold of the United States Cavalry. There was John L. Sullivan, the heavyweight champion of the world, writers like Eugene O'Neill, clergy like Cardinal Cooke, and even physicians to the Pope like Dr. Cahill. And it goes all the way back in our history. George Washington said, When our friendless standard was first unfurled, who were the strangers who first mustered around our staff?. And when it reeled in the fight, who more brilliantly sustained it than Erin's generous sons? And a century and a half later, who else than George M. Cohan would write of the Grand Old Flag, the Stars and Stripes, and Yankee Doodle Dandy with the line, I am a real live nephew of my Uncle Sam. There must have been a Divine plan that brought to this blessed land people from every corner of the Earth. And here, those people kept their love for the land of their origin at the same time that they pledged their love and loyalty to this new land, this great melting pot. They worked for it, they fought for it and, yes, they died for it and none more bravely than Erin's generous sons. Tragedy, as I have said, very often was the impetus that sent many to America. Today, as has been said here already tonight, there is tragedy again in the Emerald Isle. The Cardinal prayed and His Holiness, the Pope, plead for peace when he visited Ireland. I think we all should pray that responsible leaders on both sides and the governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland can bring peace to that beautiful Isle once again. And once again, we can join John Locke in saying, O Ireland, is not it grand you look Like a bride in her rich adornment? And with all the pent-up love in my heart, I bid you top o' the mornin'! No, I have no apathy, no feeling at all, I am just so grateful that among the other things that happened when I was allowed to move into public housing I had a chance, finally, to learn of the very rich heritage that my father had left me. And I can only say once again, with heartfelt thanks, I wear this and take it home with a feeling of great honor, and say something that I know to all of you is as familiar as top o' the mornin' or anything else. That is: May the road rise beneath your feet, the sun shine warm upon your face, and the wind be always at your back, and may God, until we meet again, hold you in the hollow of his hand.

{"id": 1049, "text": "Hello, everybody! Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat, especially Tom McMillen and Dikembe Mutombo. Every time I stand next to them I look like a little kid. I want to thank three people who are just extraordinarily important to the project of rebuilding our country and have just been great friends of mine, great friends of the Democratic Party--you already heard from one--please give it up for Governor Tim Kaine; our DNC finance chair, Jane Stetson, who is racking up a lot of frequent flier miles; and Andy Tobias, our DNC treasurer--hey, Andy. It is great to see all of you here tonight, wonderful to see so many good friends, many of you who were there from the beginning of this campaign. And I want you to all know that I appreciate everything that you have done, not just for the campaign, but also what you have done for the country and what you have done for the party. Many of you were invested in this campaign at the very beginning when nobody could pronounce my name. And you'd tell your friends, There is this young guy, I really think he is got something. What is his name? Barack Obama? Yes. So you had to confront a lot of skepticism, a lot of confusion. Some of you were involved in a campaign for the first time, and some of you got involved for the very first time in a very long time, because you believed that we were in a defining moment in our history and that your voice could make a difference. Not a single day goes by where I do not think about all the time and the energy, the money, the commitment, the unyielding faith that you put into our campaign, because it was not just about winning an election, it was about changing a country. Last year, we asked you to take on something new. We asked you to help us keep the promises that we made in the campaign, help to bring about the changes that we had talked about together. And a lot of you have worked hard to do that. You have continued to be engaged in education policy, in foreign policy, and helping us at a grassroots level and continuing to finance our ability to get our message out. And it matters. It is made the successes of the last year possible. Sometimes I think we got so many things done so quick that people forgot. But let us just think about this: We upheld the principle of equal pay for equal work. We lifted the ban on stem cell research and restored science to its rightful place in America. We provided health care to 4 million children who now have it who did not have it before. We passed the strongest veterans budget in decades. We protected families from getting ripped off by credit card companies and children from being targeted by big tobacco, and helped consumers deal with the twin plagues of mortgage fraud and predatory lending. We appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. We passed a service bill named for Ted Kennedy that is giving young and old a chance to serve their country and their communities. We are working with Congress to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. Oh, by the way, and in the meantime, we prevented the worst financial crisis from getting even worse, turned the economy from contraction to expansion, made the largest investment in clean energy in history, the largest investment in education in decades, expanded the Pell grant program, dealt with a H1N1 virus on the side. That is what your support has helped us do at home. Abroad, we have begun a new era of engagement. We are working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking a world free of them. We are working with other nations to confront climate change. We are now a leader and not a follower in that critical mission. We banned torture. We are rebuilding our military. We are reaffirming our alliances. We have begun to leave Iraq to its own people, as I committed to doing in the campaign. And we have charted a new way forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are making progress every single day in taking the fight to Al Qaida and across the globe. And I went to Cairo on behalf of the American people to begin a new dialogue with the Muslim world. We are living up to our obligations as a wealthy nation, helping to promote food security around the world, helping to deal with diseases around the world. We are living up to a moment that demands American leadership by standing with the people of Haiti as we speak. So in ways large and small, we have begun to deliver on the change that we talked about, the change that you believed in and that you campaigned hard for. But the reason that you and I are here tonight is because we are not done. We have got a lot more work to do. As I said, the day we took office, we confronted a financial system on the verge of collapse; we were losing 700,000 jobs per month; a $1.3 trillion deficit; two wars that frankly had not been paid for and were costly in every sense of the word. A lot of the solutions we proposed, the decisions we took, they were not quick, they were not easy, and they were not popular. But we decided we were going to go govern, we were going to put politicking on hold to get this country out of the mess it was in. I mentioned this to a group I spoke to earlier. You know, pundits act surprised about the fact that we spent so much political capital. Well, you know, I did not get elected to play it safe. And I did not govern, and I do not govern, by checking the polls every few days. I know that is the habit in Washington, but that is not the obligation I owe the American people, that is not the promise I made to you. And because we took bold and swift and coordinated action, we can stand here today and say we averted another depression. We broke the back of the recession. The economy is growing again. So the worst of the storm has passed. But, as all of you know, the devastation remains. We have got 10 percent unemployment. Many of you watching at home, as you go around the country and your individual communities, you see the stores shuttered and the foreclosed businesses; friends and neighbors, family members who still cannot find work. This is on top of a decade that had been tough for middle class families all across the country. They had not seen their incomes go up in years. Their costs skyrocketing at the same time as their wages were stagnant. For 2 years, I heard stories all across the country, everywhere I go. I heard stories about people trying their best to hold on; a family sitting around the kitchen table wondering if they were going to be able to retire on schedule, if they were going to be able to finance a college education for their kids, wondering when would health care costs stop climbing, when would their premiums start stabilizing. And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the American Dream, was slipping away. That is the reason I ran for ENTITY. That is the reason you supported me. And that is why we are going to continue to do everything we can to create an economy that has not just recovered back to the status quo, but an economy where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded, and where businesses are hiring and wages are rising, and where our middle class is getting stronger and more secure. Now, our most urgent task is job creation. That was our number-one priority last year and our number-one priority this year. And the first task was to make sure the economy is growing. It is growing. But we have got to do more. So we are going to give tax breaks and loans to small businesses to help them hire new workers and raise their wages and invest in new plants and equipment. We are going to put even more Americans to work on clean energy facilities and upgrading our infrastructure to meet the challenges of the 21st century. We are going to create incentives for consumers to make their homes more energy efficient, creating jobs and saving families money. And we are going to look at our Tax Code, because it is time we ended practices like giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas instead of investing in companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. But the truth is, these steps alone will not make up for 7 million jobs that have been lost over the last 2 years. They are not going to, alone, provide the economic security that is been dwindling for middle class families over the last decade. The only way we do that is to lay a strong foundation for growth over the long term. And the things that we talked about during the campaign are the things that still need to be done. They have been put off by Washington for too long. And this is where change gets hard. Change is easy if you are just talking about tinkering around the edges. Change is harder when you actually dig in and try to deal with the structural problems that have impeded our progress for too long. This is where we run headlong into the lobbyists and the special interests and the bitterness and misinformation that characterizes so much of our politics, which means that some of you may be feeling discouraged, because it feels like things have taken longer than you might have expected. Well, do not be discouraged. I am not discouraged. I knew this was going to take a long time, but I knew the fight was worth it. And we have got to keep up on this fight. The forces of the status quo, they may not give an inch, but I do not give an inch either. And you should not give an inch either. We are not. We did not come this far to put things off, or to play it safe, or to take the easy road. That was not why we were elected. We came here to solve problems for the next generation, not for the next election. That means opening up this Government to the people. That is why we post all our visitors online. That is why we have excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs and seats on boards and commissions. That is why I have called on Congress to put their earmarks online so everybody can see what is going on. That is part of the change that we promised. We have got to change the tone of Government and politics here in Washington and all across America. I am not going to give up on that either. You know, the American people are right to be frustrated about a Washington where every day is election day and the basic theory is, If you lose, I win, where we are not measuring success by what we are doing for the American people, but how we look in the latest Gallup. No wonder people are frustrated. That is why I went to the House Republican caucus the other day. We had a good discussion-- --about the challenges that are facing the American people, our ideas to solve them. That was good for the country. It is good for our democracy. I had fun. Now, there are some issues that Democrats and Republicans are not going to agree on, and that is okay. Vigorous debate is healthy. We are going to tussle from time to time. And you know what? There may be some issues that we do agree on, or at least we say we agree on. And we have to test whether or not people are serious. So I told my Republican friends I want to work together with them where I can, and I meant it, because I do not want to just score political points. I have got time to campaign down the road. In the meantime, there is a lot of work that we have got to get done together. And we can get a lot done together. And I told them I will also call them out if they say they want to work on something and then when I offer a hand I get nothing in return. The American people have to understand that. The old playbook of just blocking everything, I understand that is easier than actually doing something, and sometimes it may be more politically effective, but that is not what is going to move our country forward. That is why I am here. That is why you joined our campaign. That is what you have helped deliver over the last year. That is why I need your help now. That is why Tim and everybody in the party needs your help now, because you know as well as anyone that change does not come without a fight. We have got some fights to wage. We have got some fights to make sure that we are sparking innovation and igniting a clean energy sector where American workers are making solar panels and wind turbines and cutting-edge batteries for the new plug-in hybrid that leads on clean energy, because the economy that leads on clean energy, I believe, is going to lead the global economy. And I want America to be that nation. We are going to keep fighting to make sure that America has the best education possible for every child. And we are going to reward success through our Race to the Top program. We want every child to meet their potential, and that is why we are going to make sure that young people all across America can afford college without going broke. That is a priority. We can do that. And we could do it this year. We are going to keep fighting for commonsense rules of the road for Wall Street. And I want to be clear--there is a lot of talk about Wall Street, Main Street--we need a financial sector that works. That is a priority. We need businesses that are thriving, and they have got to raise capital; that will help them hire workers. So there is no separation between our financial system and the real economy. That is part of what this crisis has reminded us. But we have got to ensure that our economy is not brought to its knees by outdated and antiquated financial rules and the irresponsibility of a few. And that is why I expect Democrats and Republicans to want to make sure that we do not find ourselves in this same situation again. That is why we have to have financial regulatory reform. And yes, that is why we are going to fix the health care system, a health care system that too often works for insurance companies better than it does for individual Americans. And again, I did not take this on because it was easy. I got David Axelrod; he does all the polls. He whispers in my ear, Man, this health care thing is hard. I am a amateur historian, so I know that seven ENTITYs, starting with Teddy Roosevelt, could not get this done. We understood this was going to be hard. But I took it on not for its political value; I took it on because families are dealing with skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and insurance companies that routinely deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or drop people altogether when they get sick. We took it on because the costs were killing small businesses and creating an uneven playing field for our international companies, and it was eating into workers' take-home pay and canceling raises. And we took it on because it is the single best way--in fact, the only way--that we are actually going to get control of our Federal budget. So when I hear deficit hawks --quote, unquote--out there who say they want to control the Federal budget and are not willing to do a darn thing about the skyrocketing costs of health care, I get a sense they are not entirely on the level. Because our proposal for health care reform, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would bring it down by $1 trillion over the next two decades. And even in Washington that is a lot of money. I took it on because every single day, 15,000 Americans join the tens of millions who do not have health insurance, and 18 million--18,000 Americans die because of the lack of health insurance. That is what we campaigned on. That is what we are working to get it done, with Democrats and with Independents and with Republicans. We want to bring down costs and end the worst insurance practices and finally give every American a chance to have the security of quality, affordable health care. I am not going to walk away from those fights, and I do not expect you will either. You have come this far. I mean, the odds were a lot less that I'd ever be standing here than they are that we can solve some of these big problems. I mean, think about it. Tim was--when Tim endorsed me in Richmond, first endorsement I got outside of Illinois of any elected official--here he is, newly minted Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia--there was one thing that was clear, and that is he was term limited. But do not you guys--you remember this. Nobody gave us a chance. This campaign was declared dead--what?--10 times. You know, the same folks who are now writing about what next, and what is happened to the Obama, these are the same folks who were writing about how he does not stand a chance; how after New Hampshire, that was it; after Pennsylvania, that was it, right? We went through this. And they were saying your faith was misplaced and that you have set your sights too high and your hope is naive and Washington will not change. And now all of them are feeling like, See, we told you, Washington does not change. And they are feeling kind of self-satisfied about the fact that we have not yet gotten health care done. Well, let me tell you something. You did not listen to those voices then. Your voice proved them wrong. You proved that nothing can stop the power of millions of people who want to see an America that is living up to its values and its ideals. That is what you did. And that is what I am asking you to do again. This is an extraordinary moment. I want to remind you, we do not quit. And I do not quit. And we are going to bring about the changes that you believe in and I believe in, and that, ultimately, will help our children and grandchildren believe as they grow up an America in which everybody's got a decent shot at life, in which we are leading in innovation, in which we are proud of our foreign policy. That is what we were fighting for then. That is what we are fighting for now. We have taken some good steps. We got many miles to go on this journey. I hope you join me.

{"id": 657, "text": "Over the last few weeks, I have been talking a lot about America's economic future. I have told you how I believe we should go about creating strong, sustained growth; how we should pay down our long-term debt in a balanced way; and most of all, what we should do right now to create good, middle class jobs so people who work hard can get ahead. This is not some abstract debate or trivial Washington argument. I have said that this is the defining issue of our time, and I mean it. I have said that this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and I believe it. The decisions we make over the next few years will have an enormous impact on the country we live in, and the one we pass on to our children. Right now we are still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The economy is growing again, but it is not growing fast enough. Our businesses have created 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months, but we are not creating them fast enough. And we are facing some pretty serious headwinds, the effects of the recent spike in gas prices to the financial crisis in Europe. But here is the thing: We have the answers to these problems. We have plenty of big ideas and technical solutions from both sides of the aisle. That is not what is holding us back. What is holding us back is a stalemate in Washington. Last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill full of the kinds of bipartisan ideas that could have put over a million Americans back to work and helped bolster our economy against outside shocks. I sent them a plan that would have reduced our deficit by $4 trillion in a balanced way that pays for the investments we need by cutting unnecessary spending and by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more in taxes. Since then, Congress has passed a few parts of that jobs bill, like a tax cut that is allowing working Americans to keep more of your paycheck every week. But on most of the ideas that would create jobs and grow our economy, Republicans in Congress have not lifted a finger. They'd rather wait until after the election in November. Just this past week, one of them said, Why not wait for the reinforcements? That is a quote, and you can bet plenty of his colleagues are thinking the same thing. I think that is wrong. This is not about who wins or loses in Washington. This is about your jobs and your paychecks and your children's future. There is no excuse for Congress to stand by and do nothing while so many families are struggling, no reason whatsoever. And right now Congress should pass a bill to help States put thousands of teachers and firefighters and police officers back on the job. They should have passed a bill a long time ago to put thousands of construction workers back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges and runways. And instead of just talking about job creators, they should give small-business owners a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. Right now Congress should give every responsible homeowner the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage. They should extend tax credits for clean energy manufacturers so we do not walk away from 40,000 good jobs. And instead of giving tax breaks to companies who ship jobs overseas, Congress should take that money and use it to cover moving expenses for companies that are bringing jobs back to America. There is no reason to wait. So you see, every problem we face is within our power to solve. What is lacking is our politics. I need you to remind your Members of Congress why you sent them to Washington in the first place. Tell them to stop worrying about the next election and start worrying about the next generation. I am ready to work with anyone--Republican, Democrat, or Independent--who is serious about moving this country forward. And I hope Members of Congress will join me.

{"id": 788, "text": "I WANT to express my appreciation to all of you for your kind welcome, and also to take this occasion to express my great appreciation-and I think the appreciation of us all--to Senator Jackson who assumed the chairmanship of the Democratic Party at the Convention, who was greatly responsible for our success in November and has been an invaluable aid during the transition. Whatever has been done that is useful in the party in the last 5 or 6 months he has played a great part in it. And I feel that the party has served a most useful national purpose--and while Senator Jackson is obligated to serve the people of Washington in the Senate, I know that we can continue to count on him in the days to come for counsel and advice and support. So I hope we will all stand and give a good cheer to Scoop Jackson. Scoop automatically loses his share of the $4-million debt--we are not going to let him in on it. John Bailey has become the proprietor, along with Mac, of this enterprise. I think we are particularly fortunate to have John Bailey. I heard Governor Lawrence in his seconding speech say the trouble with everything is that they do not know enough of what is going on here in Washington; they ought to get out in the field. I agree with him completely. We have got a man from the field who knows what is wrong here in Washington, and I am delighted that John Bailey is going to take over this job. He is more popular today than he will be any time again in his life. I will feel that he is doing a good job when you all say, Well, Kennedy is all right, but Bailey is the one who is really making the mistakes. That is the way it was in Connecticut. Ribicoff was never wrong, it was always Bailey's fault. So that is what he is going to do down here. But I am delighted that he is going to do it. It is a sacrifice for him. But I think we are getting the services of someone who works in the party year in and year out, understands what the party can do, understands what the role of the Chairman is-and I must say that I am delighted to see him assuming the position vacated by Senator Jackson. Lastly, I want to thank all of you for being with us at the inaugural. The party is not an end in itself it is a means to an end. And you are the people who, in victory and defeat, have maintained the Democratic Party, maintained its traditions and will continue to do so in the future. I hope the relationship between all of us can continue to be as cordial as possible. I believe in strong political organizations in our country. The Republican Party is strong and vigorous today after the election of 1960. I think we are, also. And when we do that, I think we serve great national purposes. The party is the means by which programs can be put into action--the means by which people of talent can come to the service of the country. And in this great free society of ours, both of our parties--the Republican and the Democratic Parties-serve the interests of the people. And I am hopeful that the Democratic Party will continue to do so in the days to come. It will be in the interest of us all, and I can assure you that I will cooperate in every way possible to make sure that we do serve the public interest. You have done so well in the past. We could not possibly have won without your help. I look forward to working with you in the future, and I want you to know that here in Washington, we may not know always what is going on as well as you do, but at least we are trying. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmeetingthedemocraticnationalcommittee", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting of the Democratic National Committee.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-meeting-the-democratic-national-committee", "publication_date": "21-01-1961", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

{"id": 769, "text": "I HAVE had a very special project this week. I have been trying to get at least 50 new women in the Gridiron Club, and as many as I can in the National Press Club. But I am glad that we have got them in the Defense Department. Mr. Paul and Mrs. McNamara and ladies and gentlemen: When I look at a group like this, I have no trouble understanding why Bob McNamara is the greatest Secretary of Defense this country has ever had. With women like you working with him, I do not think he could lose. In fact, I would have never started my Fifty Women in Government campaign if I had known that Bob McNamara already had 50 women on this committee, because it looks like he has the market cornered. Someone asked how it is possible for women to understand politics when they have to depend almost entirely on their husbands for political education. Until recently this same question could apply, I guess, to military science. Women could hardly be expected to know anything about the military because they had to depend almost entirely on their husbands for military education, but the world is changing and the times are changing, and so are the services. I want to thank you for your efforts. Military service is becoming an attractive career to women, and we are mighty proud that it is, because it will be a better service, be a better career. And too many people always think, I have observed, of the military in negative terms. We must quit thinking of it just as a force for destruction, or as an instrument for war. A call prompted me the other day, when we were dealing with all the nuclear weapons and the warheads and the bombs and everything, and I thought that might be a good place to have a woman, to sit on the Atomic Energy Commission, because they bring into the world the men who fight the wars and do the dying. So I was able to persuade Dr. Bunting of Radcliffe to come down and she has already been confirmed by the Senate. You women are going to be represented in that field as you are in the military. Now, I think it is a myth we must destroy-about force for destruction and instrument of war. We do not want that to be universally accepted, for in a democracy the armed services have a creative role to play and that creative role must be as an agent of peace. Their purpose is not only to deter war, but to help improve the quality of our society and to serve the public good and to train young men and women for useful service. Once a career in the military for women meant just a clerical job, or an assignment as a nurse, or a nurse's aide in some clinic. This myth, too, is already being shattered, for today women are making important professional and technical contributions to the military as scientists, as engineers, as mathematicians, as administrators, as managers, as accountants, as teachers, as lawyers, as linguists. I think we need more women to play even more important roles. I think you can help encourage that. I think you have. The Armed Forces faces serious shortages of nurses and dietitians and therapists. Secretary McNamara and I are counting on you to help us find these women and to recruit them. We want you to go out on the highways and the byways and tell the young women of America that this is no longer a stag Government, this is no longer a stag administration, and no longer is there anything like a one-man's army. Tell them it is their Government, it belongs to them, and it is their army, too. We want and we need them, and we urge them to come in. It has taken us nearly 150 years to accept the truth of what Susan Anthony used to preach when she said, It was we the people, not we the white people, or the male citizens, nor we the male citizens, nor we just the male citizens, but we the whole people who form this Union. Today women have become a greater force in the quality of American life. Military life is no exception, and all of us are in your debt for making this possible. I have talked too long. I have heard it said that women always have the last word, because they have a dozen arguments left when the men are all run out. But I am sure you have a dozen arguments left in support of the women's role in the military or else you would not be serving on this committee. But for all of us, for Secretary McNamara, for the Joint Chiefs, for the service Secretaries, for the country, I want to thank you for your devotion to duty. I want to tell you how proud we are of you. We have never been stronger in the history of our country. I do not think we have ever had better opportunities to seek and ferret out and promote peace in the world. We know that is what you women want to do. I was reminded this morning of a very touching experience two friends of mine had. Mrs. Bethune was meeting with General Marshall one time during the war. She got up and asked to be excused because she had to go see--Mary McLeod Bethune, you know, was a very able and very prominent Negro woman who was a great educator and exercised a great influence on my life. She worked very closely with me several years in the Federal Government. She asked General Marshall to excuse her because she had to go see the President, and someone asked her what she was going to see the President about--President Roosevelt, whose picture hangs over there. She said, I am going to see him about women in the services, and about letting them do something besides the trivial details and the clerks and the minor jobs. That made quite an impression, that she was going to see the President. The next day they were meeting again in this consulting group and Mrs. Bethune got up and asked to be excused, and said she was sorry, but she had to go see the President again. They said, What are you going to see him for the second day? She said, I am going to get the answer, and evidently the answer was a good one, because here you are and I see a good many majors and colonels all over the place. We are very proud of it. A good many people have made great sacrifices to build this instrument of peace that we call the Defense Department. I see at some of our bases Peace Is Our Mission. Beginning with the Secretary, and the Under Secretaries, and the Assistant Secretaries, like Mr. Paul, these men have left jobs, some of them paying as much as a half a million a year, to come here and be harangued and harassed and browbeaten and fussed at and quarreled with in order to build the most efficient and most powerful peace machine we have ever had. I feel comforted that you women are here to help them and to encourage them and maybe to comfort them some in these times of tribulation. So you are welcome to the White House. We are honored that you are here. We are proud of your service and long may it continue.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthedefenseadvisorycommitteewomentheservices0", "title": "Remarks to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-defense-advisory-committee-women-the-services-0", "publication_date": "28-04-1964", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

{"id": 907, "text": "Wow, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, we will probably be entitled to another four more years after that. I want to thank you, and Art and Brandon, you are incredible. I have known you now a long time. Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry-I will sit down. You know, it is 122 degrees in this place. And we have our great Governor. Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little. This is like a test. You think Joe Biden could do this? I do not think so. I do not think so. So, I am thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona--to proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, that is a big deal. And they are great friends of mine. And we are building the wall. Next week, we will be up to 300 miles of incredible wall. Incredible. And our numbers are the best. We are very tough at the border. When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, we are not going to hurt our farmers, but we have never had better numbers than we have right now. And that is been helped because we are at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this. Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, you know with technology it is obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls. Wheels and wall. If you come back in a thousand years, you will say, Well, we still have wheels in walls. And that is the only thing you will recognize. The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol. They have been my friends from the beginning. To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. And I want to thank you very much. Thank you very much. As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election. And I will tell you, I never thought I'd say it because we had a great election. We had a great election a little while ago. Four years ago, I never thought I'd say anything could compete with 2016. This election that we are going into is the most important election in the history of our country--because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick. And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, this is beyond socialism, that it does not happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids. So, we cannot do it. Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left-wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America's borders and boundaries. They want to take the wall down, they do not want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want. Following orders from his boss. I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders. Can you believe that? Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and, you know, they want to give it to illegal aliens. You do not get it. You do not get it. Restore, catch and release. Shield violent criminal aliens. This is what they want to do. And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim and gain automatic admission into our country. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before. You get free education, you get free healthcare, why would not they come? Let us go to America. The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen. It is crazy. Biden's plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate. It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd. It will be defeated. At last night's Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you. Unity. They talk about unity. They want to bring unity. And then you listen to Michelle Obama's speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there. She taped it. No, no, she taped the speech. It was obsolete. She must have taped it about three weeks before. She could not even-look, number, I'd like to tape, maybe I will tape-I am speaking next Thursday, maybe I will tape it. But I do not think that goes. That is so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air-conditioned room. And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech-you know, they talk about me as being a divider. I am not a divider. I bring people together. We were bringing people together. We were bringing people together like never before. Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together. But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we do not have open borders. Think of that. Go to hell. When a country does not have borders, you do not have a country. You do not have a country. Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, We are talking about abolishing the police, we are talking about abolishing ICE, we are talking about abolishing prisons. Biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and other Zealots. By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations--they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone's. 91% approval rating. And they want to spend much less on our military, we have totally rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars, we have totally rebuilt our military. Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream. That is Bernie Sanders, okay. Because Joe, look he does not know where he is. But if he did, he is been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know. It will have problems; it will go down. Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear. And right now, who has a 401k? Alright, and then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way. That will go down 50, 60, 70%, 80%. And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus. Now, NASDAQ just broke an all-time record. SNP just broke an all-time record. Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it is not the mainstream of America. Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country. On November 3rd. The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona. I won it last time--by a lot. And I hear we are gonna win it by even more this time. Do not forget, last time I talked, I said we are going to give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you. I said, we are going to give you a massive regulation cuts. We are going to give you great everything. We even did Right to Try medicine. You know all about that. We did things that I did not even talk about it, we did. We did a thing called the Space Force. You never heard me talking about. I am the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign. It is true. I am the only one ever, maybe ever. But we will head to the polls and together we will stop the left and win four more years in the White House. We are joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people. And I want to congratulate your Governor because we had a spike, and he knocked that spike out so fast. I do not know. Are you sure you even had a spike? Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points. That is not so bad. And I think you are more popular today. What a job you have done. Thank you very much, Doug. A friend of mine and somebody who is a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right? The Warthog. She said, I love that plane, but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me. This was a group, and they knew her very well. A lot of friends you have. And specifically she said, Could you extend that plane? That is the best plane. It never breaks down. It is just is a winner. But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and she is fighting for us, and she is helping us, and we have to bring her into the center. Thank you, Martha. And she is running against a gentlemen who is, uh, when you read what he is done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things--you are not going to want to vote for him. You are not going to want to have them play with your second amendment. I will tell you what. If I were not ENTITY, I do not believe, Doug, you'd have a second amendment right now. I do not think you'd have. The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so it is meaningless. You will always have the right to bear arms. You will always have that. A few friends of mine who are warriors. Paul Gosar. Paul. Where is Paul? Paul, stand up. Will you? Paul Gosar. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate. Great job you are doing. These are warriors. They really are. When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House. What were we? 197 and nothing. That is never happened before. Everybody came together. The Republicans came. Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote. One half a brain. Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and I will tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right? And we have a man named Andy Biggs here. He is a fighter. He is a fighter. And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right? And we are not going to do anything with it. They will destroy that second amendment. Just remember I said it, but you are not going to have to worry about it because it is not going to happen. A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star. She became a star overnight. There was nobody tougher. There was nobody smarter. There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko. Great job, Debbie. Thank you. We want her on our side. Right fellas? We got to have her on our side. Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen. I knew that she was going. She never stops. She never gives up. Kelly Ward. Kelly, thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Great job you are doing. Are we winning? Okay, good. I think we are. That is what they say. We better win. If we do not win, this country is in big trouble. Big trouble. Also, a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt. Thank you, Jeff. And a man who did not choke under pressure. I do not even know if he is here. I think he might be here. He never choked. He kicked for 11 years. You know what that is? You ever see a golfer. They miss a three-footer. They miss a three-footer. They cannot take it back. They choke, choke, choke. Well, kickers are the same. Right? NFL kickers. This guy lasted 11 years. He is one of the best kickers ever. NFL kicker, Jay Feely. Where is Jay? Where is Jay? He is here someplace. Where is he? Jay? What happened? You could not get a good seat, Jay. I remember the 61-yarder. That was a heartbreaker. Right? But the only thing is, I will bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem. That is one thing. That is one thing-that is one thing I can tell you. And if they do not stand for our flag, if they do not stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game. Other than that, I'd like to watch, but I turn off the game. And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago. I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will. They will learn it again. It will take-this time it'll go even faster. For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages. Also, the crime was incredible what happened. They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens. They came in. They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol. And by the way, ICE, ICE is great. ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you do not want the job. There is some tough people here. None of you want the job. It is a tough job, but they like it, and they are great Patriots, and they have done a fantastic job. They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth. This is what would happen. They have ceded. And what we have done, did you ever notice the caravans? What happened? Debbie, there are no more caravans. What happened? What happened to the caravans? They do not come up anymore. The caravans do not come up. You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions. And I said, Well, why are we doing that? And they would not take. When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they would not take him. And they would not take him under the Obama administration. So, we got stuck with them because they'd fly in. They'd say, Do not land your plane. And I said something very simple. I said, That is okay. We do not have to do that. We are not going to pay you anymore. We stopped payment. We stopped payment. It is amazing how that works, Doug. Right? We stopped payment and they called. They said, We'd love to take them. We'd be honored to take them. So, we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands. They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more. It is not happening anymore. The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they do not talk about the wall anymore. They do not talk. Why do not you talk? I went, Look at all those people back there. That is called fake news, fake news. Look at them. It is the fake news. They do not talk about the wall anymore. See, we won. We got the wall. It is going to be up to 300 next week and--it is going to be finished very soon. And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it. But you know where I talk about it? Numbers. The numbers are so good. The numbers are so low. We have never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you do not get through it. You cannot get through it. You can climb Mount Everest, and you are going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker. I stood up to the lobbyists. Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone. I fought the special interests. I kept every single promise that I made, and now I am doing it with the drug companies. I just created Favorite Nation. So, if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price. And they are spending billion-they are spending so much. They are spending millions of dollars on advertising. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they are rich, the pharma, it is called Big Pharma, the number one lobbyist. They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online. Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Pharma against me, you know your drug prices are coming down. That is what it is. They are not happy. And we are giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middleman, the rebate. It is going to the people now. We are bringing the rebate and it is going to the people. They are not happy. I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much. But you are going to get 50. You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he does not understand it, but they would never do it. They would in a million years, they would not do it. It took a lot of guts to do it. I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, Sir, I do not think you should do it. I wonder why you are saying that, but we did it. We are going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2%, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, we are going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70%. Drugs. About time. And I am proud to say that they have achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America. We now have the most secure border we have ever had and it is only going to get better. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country. Here in Yuma, Arizona, we have invested over $1.7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, that is a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall. I know who is going to vote for me. I do not know though, I think I am going to win Yuma. What do you think, Doug? I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, we are winning. We are going to win Yuma big. No, you see it and you see what is going up and it is an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have. Technology is incredible. In total, I have already completely planned for the final execution, we are going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built. We may actually build some more in some soft areas that we have noticed over the last two years. So, we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible. And we have reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year. And if we keep going at the rate, it'll be about 85% in about two months. So, it is a great honor. And you know what? Your community is much safer, you see the difference, it is a much safer place to be. But more important than these numbers is the fact that we have ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country. And they say, Come back in four years, you have a trial. No more. We take them out. We bring them out. And nobody said that was possible because I could not have gotten it through the Democrats because they do not like that. So, we have people coming into this country, some great people, some really bad people too. And I mean murders and I mean rapists; I mean really bad people and they do not get in and they do not get back. When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they do not come back. Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands. And by the way, Mark Morgan, where is the great Mark Morgan? He is around here someplace. Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, We never built the cages. Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama. Okay. We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children. I did not build them. They were built in 2014. There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it. They said, He did not build it, we built that for the Obama administration. But they do not stop, they keep calling it, they say I built cages. You will hear it in one of the debates. They will say, You build cages ENTITY. I said, No, I did not build cages. That was built by Obama. Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home. We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do. Nobody told me it was going to be this hard. Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy. This was like a life and death war. You know why they do not talk about it anymore? Because they know it is bad politics, because they know having a wall, they cannot win that one. So, they just say, Let us forget it ever happened.' Because we won and they say, Let us forget. They do not want to talk about it. That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community--and protect our nation, in uniform. Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans; I was just with them. And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that is what they are. And you know nobody understands the border better than Hispanics. They know what is good, what is bad. They do not want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime. Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what we are doing on the border because they understand it. They understand it better than anybody. With the help of these patriots, we have stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and we are finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell in jail or sending them back home. MS-13, for the first time that you have ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run. Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we are deporting its members in record numbers we have never reported. I cannot believe how many there are. But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. China wants him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. When we win, I will have a deal with Iran within a month, watch, because they are dying to make a deal. But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country. We made such a great deal. You know, last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order. Then they did it again. You know why they are doing that? Because they know I am angry, because they know I do not care so much anymore. We made a great trade deal, but I do not care. But it shows you how smart they are, Doug. Another with normal, normal brain power, they'd say, Well, I am not going to buy any more corn. That is good. And we will just decouple, thank you very much. But they go the opposite. They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers. Last week, biggest ever, 42% of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while. Do you know why? Because they do not want bad things to happen, that is why. So, they are very smart. When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, Please do not do anything. They are very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world. The historic achievements that I have discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we have all done together in the last four years. Here is just a short list of our landmarks. Really, they are landmarks, true landmarks. We instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country. Everyone said, Oh, that is so bad. Remember when they said, Oh, that is so bad. I do not think it is so bad at all. We won the travel ban. The fake news said we did not because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court, and we won in the Supreme court. So, they said we lost. Can you believe it? They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, They lost. I guess, technically they are right, we lost when it did not matter. But we have it. We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we do not want the people coming in. Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5,800 murders. Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics. And you see it all the time. We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities. They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days. We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America. We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13. That is pretty good. Who would ever think there is that many? I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system. We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and they are still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico. Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border. And we are giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for. That is what we have done. I entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, known as the migrant protection protocols, to safely return asylum seekers to Mexico, while awaiting hearings in the United States. You know about that. We had to have them in the United States and we captured them, we had to keep him here. I said, No, no, we do not want them here. We want them outside. We got sued all over the place and we won. So now they do not come into the United States, they can wait outside. For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal. We do not have to go through years and years of litigation. You need Perry Mason to try and win. We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens. Think of that one. We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world. We know so much about the people coming in. We know the good and we know the bad. We have suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe. To me, that is number one. We have made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays. You know all about that. They overstay for years. They say, Maybe a night, maybe two nights. Well, five years later, you catch them. Nope, we ended it. We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals. We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries. They all take them back now. Before, they were not taking them back at all. The last administration simply released these criminals. We are making sure they go home and we are making sure they stay home. We do not want them. We issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism. You know what that is, right? Anchor babies, you know that, right? Anchor babies. Have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life. Congratulations. You are a citizen for 90 years. And then you bring in your family. You bring in your family, right? No. No good. I implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient, they cannot accept welfare for at least five years. To protect our country and our agents during the pandemic, my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens. We brought them back. We have very few in our country now. We brought them back, can you believe it? To protect US workers, I suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs, American jobs, and we are finalizing the new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of US workers. In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right? I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized. Biden opposed the ban. He said, I oppose the ban. He had no idea what the hell he was doing. Why do you oppose it, Joe? I do not know. They told me to say that. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost. We did a good thing. That was in January, I imposed it, very early. A month later, Pelosi and all these people said, Oh no, let people come in. We cannot . We imposed it because China was heavily infected. Then I imposed it on Europe also, heavily infected with Italy and France and Spain. Compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that Biden and Bernie Sanders want. The entire Biden-Harris. How about her? Is she a great one? Is she good? By the way, you talk about guns. She wants no 2nd Amendment. She wants to raise your taxes to a level you will be paying your government back for a long time. She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick. They asked me that. What do you think? I said, I am very happy. They thought I was happy. They thought I was happy for him. No, I was happy for me. The Biden-Harris plan is a step-by-step recipe for abolishing America's borders. In the Biden-Bernie manifesto, Joe Biden, promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire US border. You believe that? We just got rid of it. Free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities, this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible, and you would have murderers, killers, rapists in your midst. I do not think so. Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, really a flood, if you think, a flood all across our border. End prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud. They want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate. Now, this is all simple and I really respect because so far, I have only seen about four or five people go down. Because it is hot in here. But I will tell you this-it is 120. You know what I said before? Think of yourself at a great spa, great sauna, where it is 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there. You have to pay a lot of money. Getting off the border, getting off illegal protection, all of that, we are going to lower your taxes further. We gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of-the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we are doing more because that is going to spell growth and that is what happened. Companies are moving in like nobody has seen before. So, we are doing that. Massive additional regulation cuts. We have cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country, whether it is four years, eight years, or in one case, more. I told you already, our military is the best it is ever been. It is got $2.5 trillion worth of new, beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything. And hopefully, we never have to use it. Our nuclear arsenal, and hopefully, hopefully we never have to even look at it, our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it is never ever been before, and we have to have it there, but we never want to use it. So, we have done things not only on the border, the border is one element, and to me it is very important. Something that they always say about a president, the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices. So, by the end of our, of not my, our first term, we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges--and two supreme court justices. And, when it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you do not have the supreme court and if you do not have the courts in your side, you can forget it. The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court. They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years. You pick them young. They could be on there for 40 to 50 years. This is going to be the most consequential presidency. This is going to be the most important, and I never thought I'd say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life. So, I just want to- Thank you. I just want to say stay healthy, stay sharp, be careful. Be very careful. Go out and work like hell. We need every single vote that we can get because it is probably going to be close. I always assume it is going to be close. They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have these suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Doug and I were talking about it, and they take out registered voters. It is not registered. They say, Most likely to vote voters. That is what, most likely registered, they are dead, they are old, they are not going to go, they are not going to do anything. Be careful with your ballots but get out there. November 3rd is the biggest date, one of the biggest dates in your life, in many cases, frankly, it is the most important date of your life. One other thing we have done lot. We have gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing. We have gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what? If we do not win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it is like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on. You transplant it. It is got to grab on. If we have four more years, there is nothing that they can do. Our country is sailing. our country is sailing. So Yuma, thank you very much. Arizona, thank you very much. Thank you for all your support. We love you. We will never ever let you down. We will never let you down. Governor, thank you. Martha, go out and win. Go out and win. Vote McSally. Thank you everybody.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmakeamericagreatagainrallyyumaarizona", "title": "Donald J.

{"id": 699, "text": "Hello! Thank you! How is it going Philadelphia? Well, it is good to be back in Philadelphia. It is good to be among so many good friends, including Benjamin Franklin, one of my favorite Founders. I have to admit, I had to restrain myself because this is such an amazing facility, and just wandering around, I started reading about all kinds of American history and that the Dead Sea Scrolls were here. Staff was saying, ENTITY, you have some other stuff that you have to do. There are a couple of acknowledgments that I want to make. First of all, you have got one of the best mayors in the country, Mayor Michael Nutter is here. You have got a couple of the finest Members of Congress in Bob Brady and Chaka Fattah. And you have got somebody here who is been one of my dearest friends and one of my favorite people who has always had my back, and he and I share a lot in common. We are both--we both pretend to play basketball, even though we are way too old. We both married up and we both have extraordinary daughters. He happens also to be one of the best Members of the Senate that we have. Bob Casey is in the house. So I am here not just because I need your help, although I do. I am here because the country needs your help. When you think back to 2008, a lot of you were involved in that campaign. You did not get involved because you thought ENTITY was the odds-on favorite to become President of the United States. Let us face it. That was a long shot. The reason we came together was because we shared a belief in the basic bargain that built this country: the idea that if you are willing to work hard, if you are willing to take responsibility, that in this country you can make it; that you can find a job that pays a living wage and you can save and buy a home. You can send your kids to college so they do even better than you did. You can retire with some dignity and some respect. The idea that no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, no matter what your faith, no matter who you love, that in America you can make it if you try. It is that idea that builds the broadest middle class in the history of the world--and that was and has been the strength of America, the backbone of America--is that everybody had a shot. And we felt back in 2008 that those ideals were being lost, that we had taken a wrong turn. We had taken a surplus left behind by President Clinton and turned it into deficits as far as the eye could see, not because we invested in our economic future, but because we gave tax cuts to folks who did not need them and were not even asking for them. We put two wars on a credit card. Our economy increasingly was built on financial speculation and a housing bubble. Manufacturing was leaving our shores. And although a few people were doing really, really well, that broad-based middle class that built this country, that was the essence of this country, found themselves--you found yourselves--in a situation where wages, incomes were flatlining and job growth was the most sluggish it had been in 50, 60 years and the cost of everything from health care to college education kept on going up and up and up. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Three million jobs lost in the 6 months before I took office, while we were campaigning, 800,000 jobs lost the month that I was sworn into office. And so we had to make a series of tough decisions and decisive decisions and quick decisions, and we had to do it without much help from the other side. But the thing that gave me confidence throughout was what I had learned about the American people as I traveled all across the country--and it is a great privilege just running for President and obviously a greater privilege being President because you meet Americans from every walk of life and they show you their grit and they show you their determination. And it turns out Americans are tougher than any tough times. And so when some people said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, we decided, no, we are going to make a bet on the American worker and American industry. And because of the actions that we took, GM is back on top, and we are seeing the auto industry rehiring and producing better cars than ever. We helped to stabilize the financial system so small businesses could get help again and get credit and financing flowing again. Businesses got back to basics, and we created 4.3 million jobs over the last 27 months, 800,000 this year alone. So we have made progress. And the reason we made progress was in part because of our policies, but in part because Americans everywhere figured out how they were going to respond. And so you had small-business owners who decided, I am not going to lay off these workers because their families are counting on their jobs, that maybe I will take out less this year, maybe I will not even pay myself a salary this year so I can keep my doors open. And you had folks who were laid off at the age of 45 or 50, and they decided, you know what, I am not just going to give up, I am going to retrain, and I am going to find a job for the future, even if it means I am sitting in a classroom with kids who are my kid's age. All across the country people made tough decisions, but they were determined to move forward because, Americans, we do not quit. We do not quit. And so we can say that we are in a stronger position, we are moving in a better direction, than when I took office. Now, does that mean that I am satisfied? Does that mean we are satisfied? Absolutely not. Because we have too many friends and neighbors who are still out of work. We know too many people whose homes are still underwater, too many folks who still have too much trouble paying the bills at the end of the month. These problems that we have got, they were not created overnight, and we never thought they'd be solved overnight. But we understand where we need to go. We understand we have got to keep moving forward. And we understand that the last thing we need is to go back to the very same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. And let me tell you something : That is all the other side is offering. That is all they are offering. Governor Romney is a patriotic American, he is got a lovely family, and he should be proud of his personal success. But his ideas are just retreads of stuff that we have tried and that have failed. Bill Clinton described it well the other day; he said, they want to do the same thing, just on steroids. If you really pay attention--and one of our jobs during this election is to get folks to pay attention to what the other side is actually offering--then it boils down to deeper tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, $5 trillion in tax cuts on top of the Bush tax cuts, an average of a 25-percent tax cut for millionaires all across the country, and the elimination of regulations that would make sure that Wall Street does not engage in the kind of behavior that resulted in this crisis, that would roll back the kinds of progress we have made making sure insurance companies cannot drop you when you get sick, that would roll back environmental and worker protection and consumer protections that we have been working on not just during my administration, but for the last 30, 40 years. And that is it. That is the essence of what they are offering. And I guess he thinks either it would result in a different outcome than it did when we just tried this 10 years ago, or he and the Republican Congress are counting on the notion that we forgot how it turned out. We did not forget. We remember. We are not going back. We are moving forward, and that is why I am running for a second term as President of the United States of America. I am running to make sure that we keep bringing manufacturing and industry back to Philadelphia, back to Pittsburgh, back to Pennsylvania, back to Ohio. I want to stop giving tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want those tax breaks to go to companies that are investing right here in the United States of America. I am running to make sure that we continue on a path of providing the best education possible for every single one of our children and make sure that we have got the highest rates of college graduates of any country on Earth, because that is going to be the future. We took a student loan program where tens of billions of dollars were being funneled to banks as middlemen in the student loan program, we said, why do not we just give that money directly to students. And as a consequence, we have got millions of students who are benefiting from higher Pell grants; more kids are eligible. We are able to make sure that we can cap the amount of money that folks have to pay back each month on their student loans, because we recognized that a higher education cannot be a luxury. You cannot just count on the fact that your parents are paying for your college education. A lot of kids need help. And that is good for the country. We are not going backwards on that, we are going to keep moving forward. I am running because I want to continue to see America be the best innovator in the world. When you think about Benjamin Franklin--I just had a chance to talk to these outstanding students from a science and leadership academy who graduated. There are some of them over there, or at least some teachers. And I told them, what is America about? We have been about technology and discovery and invention, dating back to this guy. That is how we became an economic superpower. So the notion that we would now shortchange our investments in science and basic research, the possible cures for cancer or Alzheimer's or the clean energy that can make sure that we are doing something about climate change and saving money for families--that is not the answer, rolling back those investments. We have got to move forward. We are not going to move backwards. That is why I am running for President of the United States again. I am running because I want us to continue to build this country. We are a nation of builders. The mayor and I were talking as we were driving from the airport about all the projects, all the infrastructure, all the folks being put back to work making Philadelphia a more attractive place for people to do business. And all across the country, I want us to rebuild our roads and our bridges, our airports. I want us to build broadband lines and high-speed rail and wireless networks so that we have the platform for businesses to succeed all across this country. That is why I am running for President. We are not going backwards. I want to put people back to work rebuilding America. I am running because I believe in America's energy future. Since I have been President, oil production, up, natural gas production, up, oil imports, down under 50 percent. So we have focused on traditional sources of energy, but we have also doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. We have also doubled the production of clean energy. I want us to control our own energy future, and we can put people back to work in the process. And that is why I am running for President of the United States of America, because I believe we can achieve that. And I am running for President because I want to do something about our debt and our deficits in a balanced and responsible way. And that is as sharp a contrast as we have got between my approach and what Republicans are peddling right now. And I think this is worth focusing on. They think somehow they have got a winner on this issue. Let us talk about the facts here. Remember, when the last Democratic President was in office, we had a surplus. By the time I got into office, we had a $1 trillion deficit because of tax cuts that were not paid for, two wars that were not paid for, a prescription drug plan that was not paid for. We had baked into the cake structural deficits that were made even worse by the financial crisis. And so for these folks suddenly to get religion----and say, man, deficits and Government spending--when they ran up the tab and are trying to pass off the bill to me----listen, let me tell you something. Even after you factor in all the work that we did to prevent us from slipping into a depression, the pace of growth of Government spending is lower under my administration than it has been in the last 50 years. The two Presidents with the least growth in Government spending in the modern era happen to be two Democrats named ENTITY and Bill Clinton. It was not the other guys. And now you have got Mr. Romney proposing a $5 trillion tax cut. And he does not detail how it would be paid for, but if you go through the possibilities, then one of two things: either it is not paid for, in which case, that is $5 trillion that is piled on top of the debt we already have, passed onto the next generation, or it is going to come from middle class families all across this country. Those are the only two possibilities. And I am running for President because we are not going to let that happen. We are not going to allow another millionaires' tax cut to result in cuts in basic research and science, and cuts in Head Start programs, and less help to States and cities who are putting folks back to work. We are not going to have poor and disabled and seniors who rely on Medicaid having to bear the brunt for another millionaires' tax cut. We are not going to voucherize Medicare. We have got to do something about the debt and deficits, and the way to do it is by making sure that, yes, we go after waste in Government. Not every Government program works. Not every proposal or program or policy the Government offers is ideal. But what we do have to make sure of is that we do it in a balanced way. So, even as we are paring back on things that do not work--and I have already signed $2 trillion of cuts into law already and have proposed $2 trillion in additional deficit reduction--even as we are making sensible cuts, even as we are reforming our health care system to make sure that the dollars we pay actually make us healthier, what we are not going to do is to make the most vulnerable people in our society, as well as the middle class, shoulder the burden. We are going to ask those like myself who are best equipped to help to do their fair share because that is part of the American bargain. Everybody gets a fair shot. Everybody does their fair share. Everybody plays by the same set of rules. That is what we mean when we say we are going forward. We are not going to relitigate Wall Street reform. That was the right thing to do. We are not going to relitigate health care reform. It was the right thing to do; 2.5 million young people who can stay on their parent's plan and now have health insurance who did not otherwise have it. That was the right thing to do. Millions of seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs, that was the right thing to do. Health care prevention and women being able to control their own health care decisions, that was the right thing to do. We are not going backwards, we are going forward. In 2008, I said I'd end the war in Iraq. I ended it. In 2008, I said we'd go after Al Qaida. And bin Laden is no longer a threat to this country and Al Qaida is on its heels. We are transitioning in Afghanistan, and by 2014, we have set a timeline, that war will be over. And we are going to use the savings that we get from ending these wars. Half of it will go to deficit reduction; the other half, we will put to work rebuilding America, because this is the nation we need to build. That is what I mean when I say we are moving forward. We are not going to go back to the days when you could not serve in the military just because of who you love. Do not ask, do not tell was bad for America's security, and it was wrong, and we believe in the fairness and dignity and equality of all people. We are moving forward. We are not going backwards. We want to move forward and make sure that elections are not just about $10 million checks being written by folks who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. We want to move forward to make sure that we are creating an immigration system that reflects our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. Look, we are at our best when every voice is heard, when everybody has a stake. And that is not just a Democratic tradition. That is an American tradition. That is a tradition started by folks like Benjamin Franklin. That is the essence of our creed. If you look at our history, when we have made progress we have done it together. That is how this country got built. That is how my grandfather's generation was educated on a GI bill. That is how we built the Hoover Dam. That is how we sent a man to the Moon. We believe in individual initiative and the free market. We believe in entrepreneurs and risk takers being rewarded. We love folks getting rich----that is part of America's success. But we also understand there are some things we do together as a nation. That is the true lesson of our history. And that is the choice that we face in this election. Now, let me tell you, this election is going to be close, because folks have gone through a tough time. And no matter how many times you tell them, well, we avoided a whole bunch of really bad stuff, if you do not have a job, if your house is still underwater, if you have not seen your income go up in a decade, you are still frustrated. You are still concerned about your kid's future. And rightly so. And the other side, they do not have any new ideas. I am telling you, I want you all to pay attention over the next 5 months and see if they are offering a single thing that they did not try when they were in charge, because you will not see it. It will be the same stuff. The same okeydoke. But you know what they do have is they will have $500 million worth of negative ads. And they will tap into and feed into cynicism and a sense of frustration. And they will try to direct blame. That is a campaign they know how to run. The thing is, though, what you guys taught me in 2008 was when Americans, when citizens decide to come together, when they say, it is time for change, when they start talking to their neighbors and their friends and they are really starting to pay attention in terms of who is saying what and asking themselves, how do we move this country forward, when you decide change needs to happen, guess what, it happens. It happens. And so I have never been more convinced about the strength and the dignity of the American people. I have never been more convinced about our prospects for the future, and the reason is because of you. As I travel all across this country, the American people constantly give me hope. They constantly give me cause for optimism. I still believe in you. And I told you back in 2008 that I would not be--I was not a perfect man. Michelle would tell you that. And I would not --I'd never be a perfect President, but I did say I'd always tell you what I thought and I'd always tell you where I stood. And I promised you I would wake up every single day thinking about how I can work as hard as I know how, to make your lives a little bit better and to make the lives of future generations a little bit better. And you know what? I have kept that promise. And so I hope you still believe in me. And if you are ready to go out there and work, if you are ready to join me and make phone calls and knock on doors, talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors, if you are willing to work even harder than you did in 2008, we will finish what we started. We will move this country forward, and we will remind the world just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksobamavictoryfund2012fundraiserphiladelphia", "title": "Remarks at an Obama Victory Fund 2012 Fundraiser in Philadelphia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-obama-victory-fund-2012-fundraiser-philadelphia", "publication_date": "12-06-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 739, "text": "Klaus, thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me. Klaus said, It is about time you showed up. Proud to be here. Laura and I are so honored that, Klaus, you gave us a chance to come. I do want to thank President Mubarak and Mrs. Mubarak for their wonderful hospitality. I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here. I appreciate the heads of state who've joined us. I thank the foreign ministers who are here, including my own, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. And I want to thank the members of the diplomatic corps. Laura and I are delighted to be in Egypt, and we bring the warm wishes of the American people. We are proud of our long friendship with your citizens. We respect your remarkable history. And we are humbled to walk in the ancient land of pharaohs, where a great civilization took root and wrote some of the first chapters in the epic story of humanity. America is a much younger nation, but we have made our mark by advancing ideals as old as the pyramids. Those ideals of liberty and justice have sparked a revolution across much of the world. This hopeful movement made its way to places where dictators once reigned and peaceful democracies seemed unimaginable, places like Chile and Indonesia and Poland and the Philippines and South Korea. These nations have different histories and different traditions, yet each made the same democratic transition, and they did it on their own terms. In these countries, millions every year are rising from poverty. Women are realizing overdue opportunities. And people of faith are finding the blessing of worshiping God in peace. All these changes took place in the second half of the 20th century. I strongly believe that if leaders, like those of you in this room, act with vision and resolve, the first half of the 21st century can be the time when similar advances reach the Middle East. This region is home to energetic people, a powerful spirit of enterprise, and tremendous resources. It is capable of a very bright future, a future in which the Middle East is a place of innovation and discovery driven by free men and women. In recent years, we have seen hopeful beginnings toward this vision. Turkey, a nation with a majority Muslim population, is a prosperous, modern democracy. Afghanistan, under the leadership of President Karzai, is overcoming the Taliban and building a free society. Iraq, under the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki, is establishing a multiethnic democracy. We have seen the stirrings of reform from Morocco and Algeria to Jordan and the Gulf States. And isolation from the outside world is being overcome by the most democratic of innovations: the cell phone and the Internet. America appreciates the challenges facing the Middle East, yet the light of liberty is beginning to shine. There is much to do to build on this momentum. From diversifying your economies to investing in your people to extending the reach of freedom, nations across the region have an opportunity to move forward with bold and confident reforms and to lead the Middle East to its rightful place as a center of progress and achievement. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires economic reform. This is a time of strength for many of your nations' economies. Since 2004, economic growth in the region has averaged more than 5 percent. Trade has expanded significantly. Technology has advanced rapidly. Foreign investment has increased dramatically. And unemployment rates have decreased in many nations. Egypt, for example, has posted strong economic growth, developed some of the world's fastest growing telecommunications companies, and made major investments that will boost tourism and trade. In order for this economic progress to result in permanent prosperity and an Egypt that reaches its full potential, however, economic reform must be accompanied by political reform. And I continue to hope that Egypt can lead the region in political reform. This is also a time to prepare for the economic changes ahead. Rising price of oil has brought great wealth to some in this region, but the supply of oil is limited, and nations like mine are aggressively developing alternatives to oil. Over time, as the world becomes less dependent on oil, nations in the Middle East will have to build more diverse and more dynamic economies. Your greatest asset in this quest is the entrepreneurial spirit of your people. The best way to take advantage of that spirit is to make reforms that unleash individual creativity and innovation. Your economies will be more vibrant when citizens who dream of starting their own companies can do so quickly, without high regulatory and registration costs. Your economies will be more dynamic when property rights are protected and risk-taking is encouraged, not punished, by law. Your economies will be more resilient when you adopt modern agricultural techniques that make farmers more productive and the food supply more secure. And your economies will have greater long-term prosperity when taxes are low and all your citizens know that their innovation and hard work will be rewarded. One of the most powerful drivers of economic growth is free trade. So nations in this region would benefit greatly from breaking down barriers to trade with each other. And America will continue working to open up trade at every level. In recent years, the United States has completed free trade agreements with Jordan, Oman, Morocco, and Bahrain. America will continue to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements in the region. We strongly supported Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and we will continue to support nations making the reforms necessary to join the institutions of a global economy. And to break down trade barriers and ignite economic growth around the world, we will work tirelessly for a successful outcome to the Doha round this year. As we seek to open up new markets abroad, America will keep our markets open at home. There are voices in my country that urge America to adopt measures that would isolate us from the global economy. I firmly reject these calls for protectionism. We will continue to welcome foreign investment and trade. And the United States of America will stay open for business. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires investing in your people. Some analysts believe the Middle East and North Africa will need to create up to 100 million new jobs over the next 10 to 15 years just to keep up with population growth. The key to realizing this goal is an educated workforce. This starts early on, with primary schools that teach basic skills such as reading and math rather than indoctrinating children with ideologies of hatred. An educated workforce also requires good high schools and universities where students are exposed to a variety of ideas, learn to think for themselves, and develop the capacity to innovate. Not long ago, the region marked a hopeful milestone in higher education. In our meeting yesterday, President Karzai told me he recently handed out diplomas to university graduates, including 300 degrees in medicine and 100 degrees in engineering and a lot of degrees to lawyers. And many of the recipients were women. The people of the Middle East can count on the United States to be a strong partner in improving your educational systems. We are sponsoring training programs for teachers and administrators in nations like Jordan and Morocco and Lebanon. We sponsored English language programs where students can go for intensive language instruction. We have translated more than 80 children's books into Arabic. We have developed new online curricula for students from kindergarten through high school. It is also in America's interest to continue welcoming aspiring young adults from this region for higher education to the United States. There were understandable concerns about student visas after 9/11. My administration has worked hard to improve the visa process. And I am pleased to report that we are issuing a growing number of student visas to young people from the Middle East. And that is the way it should be. And we will continue to work to expand educational exchanges, because we benefit from the contribution of foreign students who study in America, because we are proud to train the world's leaders of tomorrow, and because we know there is no better antidote to the propaganda of our enemies than firsthand experience with life in the United States of America. Building powerful economies also requires expanding the role of women in society. This is a matter of morality and of basic math. No nation that cuts off half its population from opportunities will be as productive or prosperous as it could be. Women are a formidable force, as I have seen in my own family and my own administration. As the nations of the Middle East open up their laws and their societies to women, they are learning the same thing. I applaud Egypt. Egypt is a model for the development of professional women. In Afghanistan, girls who were once denied even a basic education are now going to school, and a whole generation of Afghans will grow up with the intellectual tools to lead their nation toward prosperity. In Iraq and in Kuwait, women are joining political parties and running campaigns and serving in public office. In some Gulf States, women entrepreneurs are making a living and a name for themselves in the business world. Recently, I learned of a woman in Bahrain who owns her own shipping company. She started with a small office and two employees. When she first tried to register her business in her own name, she was turned down. She attended a business training class and was the only woman to participate. And when she applied for a customs license, officials expressed surprise because no woman had ever asked for one before. And yet with hard work and determination, she turned her small company into a $2 million enterprise. And this year, Huda Janahi was named one of the 50 most powerful businesswomen in the Arab world. Huda is an inspiring example for the whole region. And America's message to other women in the Middle East is this: You have a great deal to contribute; you should have a strong voice in leading your countries; and my Nation looks to the day when you have the rights and privileges you deserve. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires extending the reach of freedom. Expanding freedom is vital to turning temporary wealth into lasting prosperity. Free societies stimulate competition in the marketplace. Free societies give people access to information they need to make informed and responsible decisions. And free societies give citizens the rule of law, which exposes corruption and builds confidence in the future. Freedom is also the basis for a democratic system of government, which is the only fair and just ordering of society and the only way to guarantee the God-given rights of all people. Democracies do not take the same shape. They develop at different speeds and in different ways, and they reflect the unique cultures and traditions of their people. There are skeptics about democracy in this part of the world. I understand that. But as more people in the Middle East gain firsthand experience from freedom, many of the arguments against democracy are being discredited. For example, some say that democracy is a Western value that America seeks to impose on unwilling citizens. This is a condescending form of moral relativism. The truth is that freedom is a universal right, the Almighty's gift to every man, woman, and child on the face of the Earth. And as we have seen time and time again, when people are allowed to make a choice between freedom and the alternative, they choose freedom. In Afghanistan, 8 million people defied the terrorist threats to vote for a democratic President. In Iraq, 12 million people waved ink-stained fingers to celebrate the first democratic election in decades. And in a recent survey of the Muslim world, there was overwhelming support for one of the central tenets of democracy, freedom of speech: 99 percent in Lebanon, 94 percent here in Egypt, and 92 percent in Iran. There are people who claim that democracy is incompatible with Islam. But the truth is that democracies, by definition, make a place for people of religious belief. America is one of the most is one of the world's leading democracies, and we are also one of the most religious nations in the world. More than three-quarters of our citizens believe in a higher power. Millions worship every week and pray every day, and they do so without fear of reprisal from the state. In our democracy, we would never punish a person for owning a Koran. We would never issue a death sentence to someone for converting to Islam. Democracy does not threaten Islam or any religion. Democracy is the only system of government that guarantees their protection. Some say any state that holds an election is a democracy. But true democracy requires vigorous political parties allowed to engage in free and lively debate. True democracy requires the establishment of civic institutions that ensure an election's legitimacy and hold leaders accountable. And true democracy requires competitive elections in which opposition candidates are allowed to campaign without fear or intimidation. Too often in the Middle East, politics has consisted of one leader in power and the opposition in jail. America is deeply concerned about the plight of political prisoners in this region as well as democratic activists who are intimidated or repressed, newspapers and civil society organizations that are shut down, and dissidents whose voices are stifled. The time has come for nations across the Middle East to abandon these practices and treat their people with dignity and the respect they deserve. I call on all nations to release their prisoners of conscience, open up their political debate, and trust their people to chart their future. The vision I have outlined today is shared by many in this region, but unfortunately, there are some spoilers who stand in the way. Terrorist organizations and their state sponsors know they cannot survive in a free society, so they create chaos and take innocent lives in an effort to stop democracy from taking root. They are on the wrong side in a great ideological struggle, and every nation committed to freedom and progress in the Middle East must stand together to defeat them. We must stand with the Palestinian people, who have suffered for decades and earned the right to be a homeland of their own to have a homeland of their own. I strongly support a two-state solution, a democratic Palestine based on law and justice that will live with peace and security alongside a democrat Israel. I believe that the Palestinian people will build a thriving democracy in which entrepreneurs pursue their dreams, and families own their homes in lively communities, and young people grow up with hope in the future. Last year at Annapolis, we made a hopeful beginning toward a peace negotiation that will outline what this nation of Palestine will look like, a contiguous state where Palestinians live in prosperity and dignity. A peace agreement is in the Palestinians' interests, it is in Israel's interests, it is in Arab States' interests, and it is in the world's interests. And I firmly believe that with leadership and courage, we can reach that peace agreement this year. This is a demanding task. It requires action on all sides. Palestinians must fight terror and continue to build the institutions of a free and peaceful society. Israel must make tough sacrifices for peace and ease the restrictions on the Palestinians. Arab States, especially oil-rich nations, must seize this opportunity to invest aggressively in the Palestinian people and to move past their old resentments against Israel. And all nations in the region must stand together in confronting Hamas, which is attempting to undermine efforts at peace with acts of terror and violence. We must stand with the people of Lebanon in their struggle to build a sovereign and independent democracy. This means opposing Hizballah terrorists, funded by Iran, who recently revealed their true intentions by taking up arms against the Lebanese people. It is now clearer than ever that Hizballah militias are the enemy of a free Lebanon. And all nations, especially neighbors in the region, have an interest to help the Lebanese people prevail. We must stand with the people of Iraq and Afghanistan and other nations in the region fighting against Al Qaida and other extremists. Bin Laden and his followers have made clear that anyone who does not share their extremist ideology is fit for murder. That means every government in the Middle East is a target of Al Qaida. And America is a target too. And together, we will confront and we will defeat this threat to civilization. We must stand with the good and decent people of Iran and Syria, who deserve so much better than the life they have today. Every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in stopping these nations from supporting terrorism. And every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. To allow the world's leading sponsor of terror to gain the world's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations. For the sake of peace, the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Changes I have discussed today will not come easily. Change never does. But the reform movement in the Middle East has a powerful engine: demographics. Sixty percent of the population is under 30 years old. Many of these young people surf the Web, own cell phones, have satellite televisions. They have access to unprecedented amounts of information. They see what freedom has brought to millions of others and contrast that to what they have at home. Today I have a message for these young people. Some tell you some will tell you change is impossible, but history has a way of surprising us, and change can happen more quickly than we expect. In the past century, one concept has transcended borders, cultures, and languages: in Arabic, hurriyya; in English, freedom. Across the world, the call for freedom lives in our hearts, endures in our prayers, and joins humanity as one. I know these are trying times, but the future is in your hands, and freedom and peace are within your grasp. Just imagine what this region could look like in 60 years. The Palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserved: a democratic state that is governed by law, respects human rights, and rejects terror. Israel will be celebrating its 120th anniversary as one of the world's great democracies, a secure and flourishing homeland for the Jewish people. From Cairo, Riyadh, Baghdad to Beirut, people will live in free and independent societies, where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism and trade. Iran and Syria will be peaceful nations, where today's oppression is a distant memory and people are free to speak their minds and develop their talents. Al Qaida, Hizballah, and Hamas will be defeated, as Muslims across the region recognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision and the injustice of their cause. This vision is the same one I outlined in my address to the Israeli Knesset. Yet it is not a Jewish vision or a Muslim vision, not an American vision or an Arab vision. It is a universal vision based on the timeless principles of dignity and tolerance and justice, and it unites all who yearn for freedom and peace in this ancient land. Realizing this vision will not be easy. It will take time and sacrifice and resolve. Yet there is no doubt in my mind that you are up to the challenge, and with your ingenuity and your enterprise and your courage, this historic vision for the Middle East will be realized. May God be with you on this journey, and the United States of America will be at your side.

{"id": 959, "text": "Wow, thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. We love being with you. We love being with you. Incredible people, incredible people. Thank you very much. And I am thrilled to be here in Albuquerque with thousands of hard-working, freedom-loving American patriots. Thank you. Incredible. We are all united by the same love of our great country. And by the way, our country is doing great. You see it. The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that America is blessed by, the eternal grace of Almighty God. Good night to that person. Tomorrow they will say, Massive protest. No, one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner. Good night. But we are bound by these convictions. We will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020. And by the way, you have thousands and thousands of people outside who cannot get in. So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it. We try to get the biggest arena we can get, and they are never big enough, frankly. So there is something going on. And I always say, 2016, I do not know if there'll ever be another 2016. But right now it is like a great tree or a great plant, you plant it and it has to take hold. We have to win 2020. We are doing so well. We have to win 2020. And every day, and you know as well as I do, we are battling against the corrupt establishment of the past, and we are achieving historic victories for the American people. We are winning again. We are winning again, and we are winning big. We are winning big. Crucially for your state, we have ended the last administration's war on American energy. And since my election, natural gas productions, big story today, in New Mexico has increased by 40%, 4-0. And that means great wages, and it means jobs. And that is why you are breaking every single record in your state's book. Crude oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled, and going up a lot higher very quickly. And your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds. Think of that. Two-thirds. And that is in a short period of time. Give me a little bit more time, okay? The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And this means more jobs, higher wages, and American energy independence, which is what we have. A few years ago, if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the Middle East, we would've been in a panic. Although, not if I were your president. We never panic. We do not want to panic. But a few years ago, they would have been in a panic. Today we got a lot of oil, we got a lot of gas. We got a lot of oil and gas. We do not have to send too many boats over there. Did you notice the other day, they were saying, We do not see too many American ships anymore. You know why? Because we do not need We are independent, as independent as we want. And we are now a net exporter of energy. Revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future. And they have generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico. Thank you very much, ENTITY. Thank you. Now, under the Green New Deal, that all goes away. That all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric. Single car. You are not allowed to travel more than 162 miles. They will call us the hermit nation. We will never leave our house. No, it is crazy. But that is okay. I do not want to bring it up because I do not want to do it too early. Maybe they will change, and I do not want them to change. But think of it for you, and for Texas, and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy. I mean, explain that one. Explain that. Yet, every major Democrat running for president, they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. In other words, the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico's economy. The Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers. They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes. That is not happening anymore. It is been a long time. It is been a long time. It is not happening anymore. But Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance. Under this administration, America is working again. America is winning again. And America is respected again, like it has not been for a long time. And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders, and their presidents, and their kings, and their queens, and their prime ministers, and their everything, dictators every once in a while. Every once in a while, you get an a rogue dictator. And I will tell you, they always start off, today I had the Crown Prince of Bahrain, and they come in and they say, Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on what you have done with the economy of the United States. It is a model for the entire world. They all say it. And earlier today Do we have any baseball fans? Right? Right? You know what I am going to say. But earlier today in the White House, I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that is the highest civilian award, to someone who truly embodies the American dream, baseball legend, the greatest, by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, Mariano Rivera. He was something. The Yankees won a lot of World Series because of Mariano. Great guy. We gave him the medal. Done so much for charity. A fantastic man, fantastic family. It was a beautiful day at the White House, so it was good. My administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential. We have created six million new jobs since election day. The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection. Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone. Think of that. Wages in your state, New Mexico, are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago. And I used to say during the campaign, you go back, it is hard to believe, I am here almost three years Can you believe how time is flying? Can you believe it? I do not know about it me, but you look all much better than you did three years ago. You are wealthier. And even with the Me Too movement, we cannot say this, but I will say it anyway, you are better looking, including the men, including the men. Now you are all looking good. Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30%, more than any state in the United States. Think of that. More than any state in the United States. So essentially, that is saying you are in a certain category, which is a very important category, you are doing better than any state in the United States. How do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one, right? How do we lose that one? And yet, for whatever reason, it is been quite a while since a Republican won this state. But we are going to win this state. And I think we are going to win this state easy. You had to see the people all the way in from the airport. That was a long drive by the way, 35 minutes. That was a long drive. But all the way in, we had people, and they were waving. And I did not see any negative hand gesture, right? No, I think we are going to do great here. And we are here for a number of reasons, but we are here because we really think we are going to turn this state and make it a Republican state. Yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month. Who is Hispanic here? Latinos for ENTITY. Thank you. Incredible people. But we have much to celebrate. Unbelievable when you think, the unemployment for Hispanic-Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic-American poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history. And after years of stagnation that you know very well, wages for Hispanic-Americans are rising really fast, up nearly 8% since my election. Those are unheard of numbers. They are unheard of. And median income, think of that, median income for Hispanic-Americans surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever. That is your median. That is not bad. That means you are wealthy and you are getting wealthier fast. And I just want to tell you it is an honor. But when I am on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical Democrats, whoever it may be, and they start telling you what they are going to do for you, and you say, But we have the best numbers, every category, that we have ever had. Hispanic-Americans excuse me, New Mexico as a whole, we have the best numbers. African-Americans, the best numbers that we have ever had in the history of our country. Asian-Americans, the best numbers that we have ever had in history. Women, the best numbers that we have had in 71 years. We are working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's Hispanic-American citizens, including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican-Americans who enrich our society, strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to our shared American family. And I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border, and I want to thank the president of Mexico. You know, it is very interesting, I hear everybody screaming, well, you know we are building the wall, and it is going up, and it is going up fast. And if you think that is easy with the Democrats who control the House, we have to take it back, but if you think it is easy But we are building a lot of wall. We will have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year, and it is making a big difference. 500 miles. But you know we won a big case two months ago in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what we are doing. This has been I will tell you what. Ready? Another president would have given up a long time ago. We do not give up. So we are building the wall, the Army Corps of Engineers, we are doing a beautiful job. It is a great, it is a great structure. It is a great structure. You are going to have to really want to get over that wall, to do it. But it was very interesting because, not too long ago, I saw where the Hispanic-American, the Hispanics, were up with me in a poll, 17%. And everyone said, How is that? How is that? How is that? 17%. Up by 17%. I will not even tell you what the final number was because they will not believe it, but you are going to see what the final number But you know why? Because the Hispanic-Americans, they understand, they do not want criminals coming across the border. They do not want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security, and they want the wall. They want the wall. And we have a man in the audience who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me, right here. Look at him. Come here. Look at him. Look at this guy. And he is been to a couple of rallies too, have not you? Huh? We have some people, a group of people the other day, you know, we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable. Two of them. One of them, it was going to be very, very close. Here is another one of my friends. Thank you. I like that beautiful red tie you are wearing. But we had a victory, two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago, we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech the night before. The turnout was beyond belief. And instead of being down by 17 points, he easily won the election 4,000 or 5,000 votes. And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I do not know, I'd ask the media, but they will not give me how many What did he get? Do you know? Like 20, 21? He won by a lot. He won by a lot. I'd asked them, but we are not going to get a straight answer. They were not happy. They were not happy. I will tell you, Tuesday night, the fake news was not happy. They had their studios all built. CNN had their A- list talent. They do not have A-list talent, but they had the best they could have. And they were all set. This was going to be the end of ENTITY, because this man was going to lose. But he turned out to be tough and smart. And in all fairness, I helped a lot too. And toward the end of the night, they started dismantling that studio. Probably it would have been there for four weeks. This is the end. But we had two great victories, congressional victories, on Tuesday night. And it was something. The one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much. And the other won a race that he was way, way, way back. In fact, I should not tell you this, but my geniuses, my people, some of those people standing right there, right there, some of them right there, they said, Sir, do not get involved in that race, sir. You cannot come back from 17 points, sir. It is too much. I said, But you know, I really like the guy. I think he is great. Let us give it a shot. They say, Sir, if you lose, they will never, ever It will be much worse. I said, Let me tell you, I know them very well. Whether I help him or do not help him, it is going to be the same. It is going to be a disaster. So let us help him. And we campaigned, and we worked hard, right? They said, Do not do it, sir. Do not do it. Please do not do it, sir. It will be very embarrassing. I said, No, I do not mind being embarrassed. I do not mind being embarrassed. We are also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades. And we are building an amazing future for citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed. And that is what we have. That is what we have. Race, religion, color, and creed. But the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that we have gained. They want to raise your taxes. They want to bury you in regulation. They want to take away your health insurance, 180 million Americans. They want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology. And left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense. You know that. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, and your social security. And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms. The left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate Americans into submission. They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can. They will do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you. They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel, or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what they are doing today to Justice Kavanaugh. Look at what they are doing. Did you see the New York Times? Did you see what they are doing? Did you see what Democrats, they are calling for his resignation. They are calling for his impeachment. And the woman involved said she did not know anything. But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story. The woman said, I do not remember that. Can you believe? And they still want him to be impeached. And I just put out a statement. And he is a great man, by the way, a great talent. A great brilliant man, Brett Kavanaugh. and I just put out a statement on social media that said, I do not think they will do it, but they should, for the good of the nation, I call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story. And while you are at it, the Russian witch-hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story. They have taken, the old gray lady, do you know the New York Times, for years, the old gray lady, so prestigious, they have taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover, and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead. Long live The New York Times. Long lived The New York Times. And I do want it to live, but they have to be, they have to change their ways. Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she does not remember this. Can you even believe it? And yet, all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country. With all that we have going, with Saudi Arabia, with Iran, with China trade deal, with Russia, with North Korea, with all that we have going, look at the cards that we have been dealt, lucky we won the election in 2016, believe me. With all that we have going, they say, Let us impeach Justice Kavanaugh, one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family. Let us impeach him. It is a made-up story. Let us impeach President ENTITY. Think of that. The Muller Report came out. Think of this. This crazy Mueller Report comes out, 18 ENTITY haters, liberal Democrats, some worked for Hillary Clinton, they found nothing. No, think of it. After two years, they found nothing. They spent $40 million. There is not a person in the room that I could not find something on with that. They spent, think of it, they found nothing. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. To stop the far left's campaign of destruction, you must vote Republican. And you are going to get the chance very soon. We are joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and somebody that is done an incredible job, she ran Michigan for me. And as you know, for the presidential races, Michigan had not been won in decades, and she kept saying, Could you come back, sir? I did not know who she was. I said, Who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking? She said, Sir, if you keep coming back, you are going to win Michigan. Has not been won in decades. And I won Michigan. Remember that great, great night? November. That great, great night. ENTITY has won the great state of Michigan. And they were going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night- Going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night for certain people. Remember the couple of people that were crying? I guess they do not like a strong military. They do not like cutting regulations. They do not like low taxes. They do not like Right to Try, you know Right to Try. All these things we have done. For the Vets, we got choice. We got choice for the Vets. Choice. Everybody said it was impossible. We have rebuilt our military. I told this story for the first time today. A general came into my office in my first few weeks, you remember? It was a little dangerous out there. President Obama left us with a few beauties, right? And I said to this general, You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict. And he looked at me and he goes, Sir, we have very little ammunition. I said, Say it again. And I want to tell you the words, very little, he did not use because it was less than that. And I said, I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict, and a general looks at him and said, 'We have very little/ no ammunition.' I never want a president of the United States to be in that position. And since then, three years, $700 billion we have spent, then $716 billion. And now, $738 billion. And our military is by far the greatest in the world. There is nobody that even comes close. So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position. And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what I have gone through either. That should never happen. What happened is a disgrace to our country. No president should ever have to go through it. And I will tell you what, 99% of them would never have been able to take it. They would not have been able to take it. But we won the great state of Michigan, and now we are doing really well, because we have moved a lot of car companies. I tell Japan, sorry, big deficits with all these countries, we are changing it, but you have got to get car companies. We are building car companies now in Michigan. They are not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including China, including Mexico. They are going to stay home, and they are going to pay you a lot of money, and everybody's going to be happy. But Michigan's doing great. And Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party chair of Michigan. So when we won the election, I said, Let us get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC. And she has done an incredible job. Thank you Ronna. A great gentleman who loves the Republican Party, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Tommy, what a job. New Mexico Republican party chairman. Steve Pearce. My friend and a really talented guy, he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time. Brad Parscale. What a job he is doing, Brad. Great job, Brad. Great job. And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on CNN, and they did not like him because he was too positive on ENTITY. Can you believe it? He happens to be Hispanic. He happens to be Hispanic, but I have never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a wasp than I do. So I have not figured that one out. But I will tell you what. There is nobody that loves his country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortez, Steve. Thank you Steve. Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics? He says the country. I do not know. I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote. You know, just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote, close to 90%. they gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award. And the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for ENTITY, I will tell you that. They are all for ENTITY. They like what we are doing. With the help of, and Steve, I want to thank you very much by the way, and you were incredible on CNN, and now you will get a real job. Okay? Steve, that audience was not big enough for you. Their ratings are not good. With the help of everyone here tonight, we are taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country, and to the people of New Mexico. We have cut a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household $3,000. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. What that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico making $75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than $2,000. And it is one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe, and you look at Asia, and China's not doing too well. I must be honest with you, worst year in 57 years, I'd say that is not good. But I hope they still like me. And we have taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs, and we have given those tariffs, and by the way, China's eating the tariffs, they are devaluing their currency, the prices are very similar. They are eating the tariffs. And out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart, that the farmers love ENTITY, and ENTITY loves the farmers. I said to our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things? He said, $16 billion. I said, That is okay. We will take $16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number. We are going to give it to the farmers, so that they are even. And I tell you, the farmers do love ENTITY, they do love ENTITY. And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children. Now, if you do not like your children, do not do it. But when it is your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, they are taking care of you. You really love them. It is a great thing. If you do not love them, do not even listen to the last line, because it will not matter. Do not leave it to them. If they are not good, leave it to charity. Leave it to something else. Do not get it to them. I know a guy who cannot stand his children, they are horrible, horrible human beings. They are a little older now, but they are horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, Why would you leave them? They do not even like you. But on the assumption that you love your children, you will be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. You will be able to leave them to your children. Your children will not have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They will not be losing it to the banks five years later. We got rid of it. That is a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that, in New Mexico, you know exactly what I am talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control. Look at what is going on now, how we are doing. I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico. We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country. And I will take it. Because our laws are so bad, they are so pathetic. And the Democrats could change these laws. They could change them so quickly. We could change them all in less than an hour. We could, whether it is asylum, whether it is any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad. How they got that, it took years and years to end up. But we have the Mexican soldiers out there. You see them, and they are stopping people. The numbers are plummeting down. So I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico. Amazing. Well, we have got to get rid of the loopholes. You know, the word is loopholes, and the Democrats could do it fast. But in the meantime, we are doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people are not getting through. I mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter, or a world class Mount Everest type climber. There is not too many around like that. It is really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another. And that is changing also, you see what is happening, and when these rich countries think we are going to pay for their military every year, billions and billions and billions, and they are rich, and they take our business and we are supposed to, on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but I am going to save them for the campaign. Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign. Wait until this campaign starts, you know, like I was telling Brad and I was telling a few of the folks, one thing I do not want to do, Michael back there, Michael, hello. What a job he is done. But I am telling them I do not want to do this too early. I do not want to do it. You know the Pocahontas thing, I did that, it was before its time. Right? It was before it is time. Too early. 1,024. That means I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none, unfortunately. I'd like to say I have a lot. Got to get me another 4%. maybe another 10%. but I was early with her, and frankly, oh it is coming back, do not worry about her. But those days are over under this administration. We are finally putting America first. Putting it first. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks. Some have been demolished, some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing. But all those jobs are gone, and we are bringing them back. They are coming back like almost never before. Probably, I can say they are coming back like never before. People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is. And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA. Your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. This was one of the great catastrophes. And now we are replacing NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA. Think of the song YMCA. YMCA. Think of the song. USMCA, that is US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And it is drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country. It is amazing. I want to just, yeah. the Dona Ana County Board of Commissioners, all Democrats just unanimously endorsed the USMCA, and urged Congress to pass it immediately. Thank you very much commissioners. All Democrats. Hopefully they will put it up for a vote. Nancy Pelosi, they put it up for vote. It is going to be very popular. The Republicans love it, and the Democrats love it, and frankly, labor loves it. Unions love it. Farmers love, love, love it, and everybody wants it. Your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it. It is an incredible agreement. And Mexico's already passed it, and Canada's ready to pass it, soon as we do. See, they do not maybe trust us, that is why. They say, Why are not you passing it now? They say, Oh, we will pass it. They are going to pass it as soon as we do. Past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy. China's been taking out from 300 billion to $500 billion a year. Billion, not million. Billion. Think of what $500 billion is. We have rebuilt China, but now it is a different ball game. Somebody had to do something with China. President Obama should have done it. Presidents Bush should have done it. President Clinton should have done it. They all should have done it. Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that we are doing right now. So if you look at it, nobody did it, so I am doing it, and that is what is going to happen. We are doing well. So now we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. When in the past, we never got 25 cents. We never got money. We never got anything. You know what we got? Unemployment and losses. And some cheap pencils. More than we needed. You could do with one less pencil. Following decades of outsourcing and offshoring, our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong. If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is one very simple solution. Come and make your product in America. Come and make your product in New Mexico. And by the way, I am just seeing this great group of people, this spirit, is there any place in the world that is more fun or more exciting than a ENTITY rally? Really? Is there anything? When you think about it, it is not about fun. It is about achievement. Because what we have achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled. There is never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we have been able to do or achieve. In a few short weeks, we will be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges. Because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, I assume I have no judges to appoint. No sir, you have 138 judges. 138? Did not put them up, could not get them approved. I do not know what happened, but we started off with 138, now we are up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and I have always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that is okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we are smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means you are the super elite. I have always take offense when somebody said, ENTITY is tired of listening to the elite. I said, No, no, I am more elite than them. Right? I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And I will be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it is incredible. But it is the greatest single decision I have ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. Is not that nice? It is time to finally take care of our own. And we are all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible. And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades. 30 years. And at the center of America's drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody. People said, Oh, the Hispanics will not like a wall. I said, I think they are going to love it. They will not like border security. I think they going to love it. You know why? Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people do not understand it. The border crisis, every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your Southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and we are stopping them now. You see the kind of numbers, we are getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth. We have had some shipments where it could kill half of the country, some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff. If it were distributed, it could actually, has the power to kill half of the country. This is like a warlike situation. That is why you are liking ENTITY, because you are not going to let that happen. If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women, that is what they traffic in, it is women. They are not trafficking in men. They capture women, and they bring them across the open borders, and they do not go through ports of entry, where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas, and they hang a left, or they hang a right and they come in, but now when you have a wall, they cannot do that. Right? They cannot do that. And so many of these Democrats that are against the wall, it is common sense? Look, you know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention, they just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it is for? They are building a big wall around the building, they are building a big wall. A massive wall. We should tell them, open borders. Let anybody come in. And a few years ago, almost every one of these, they are on tape. That is the problem with politics. Three years ago, they could say, look, I saw Senator Schumer, I saw Nancy I saw all of them. They said, No, we need a wall. We must have a wall. President Obama, We must have a wall. We must stop people from coming into our country illegally. We have to stop it. We need a wall. Now, a few years later, they do not want a wall. You know why? Because anything I want, they want to do the opposite. And that is okay. That is the only reason. But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which we are taking out every year by the thousands, and getting them the hell out of our country, because of ICE. And if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know it is poisoning our youth. That is what it is, it is nothing other than that, it is very simple. They are poisoning our youth. You have only one choice. You must elect Republicans. And to be honest with you, you have got to elect ENTITY. We need four more years. ENTITY. How about these phony Democrats? They started with Russia, Russia, Russia. That turned out to be be a fraud. That turned out to be a fraud. Then they went to race. Do you believe that one? Race. I am the least racist person in this room. Then they went to recession, there is going to be a recession. Oh please, let there be a recession, please. Because we have a better chance of defeating him if there is a recession. And unfortunately, the stock market's only a few points from its all time high, which we have broken on, I think it is well over a hundred times. We broke the all time record. And now they have a new one. And I am enriching myself. Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars, but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening, and pays $439, emoluments. Nobody ever heard the word emolument before. Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument. He is enriching himself. If somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland, from an airport that I do not own, and they happen to go to a hotel, he is enriching himself, like 20 people, I am going to lose billions of dollars, and that is okay. I expected to do that when I did it. I did not know what would happen if I lost. Can you imagine? Supposing I lost, and we would have had the same basic rhetoric. I mean, winning was great. Supposing, you know, I am doing all the things. I am telling you all the same sort of things. Supposing I did not make it. I'd have to go around. I would've lost and lost billions, then I would have been really unhappy. But I will tell you what, I expected that when I did this, in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do. So I will lose billions of dollars, always expected. They say, I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel. It does not work that way folks. And these are very, very dishonest people, and they know it. So they have given up on every other hoax, but it does not work that way. You know it too. You get it. The democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities, and your schools, and your hospitals, and public safety all at the expense of hardworking New Mexico families, and throughout our country. Sheriffs, and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in New Mexico. They do not want open borders. They do not want criminals pouring into your communities, and doing what they do, and we will not even talk about that. They want strong, these are people that are with you in many cases, Democrats. They write letters, we need strong border security. In San Diego, California is very difficult. Always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego, good mayor in San Diego by the way. They wanted a wall. And I said, You know what, let us build it someplace else. Because California, you know, once we build it, they will complain. But then I said, You know, the people are pouring in. They needed it. They are pouring into San Diego, like going all over the place. And people that had houses, they did not like people running over their gardens all day long, coming in from the other side. So we put up a wall, and I thought everybody would be happy. As soon as it was finished, the day it was finished, I was notified. We did not want the wall. Why did you do the wall? And I will tell you, in other words, it is all a game. I'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to New Mexico. And if I did that, they'd go crazy. And they'd say, Please sir, do not do that. Please, please. The same people that are saying, We do not want a wall. Why did you put up a wall? And I knew that was going to happen. I told my people that was going to happen. But they are very happy with their wall. Most of them will not say it. They love it. It stopped it only stopped 99.9% of the people coming in. And the only reason I am not moving it to New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new, beautiful wall, so I will give you a brand new beautiful wall. New beautiful wall, I will give you a brand-new one. It is true. It is true. I actually priced it out. It is true. These contractors, all my life I have been deal They can find a way to make money. Sir, it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one. They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing. This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right? So, Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens. Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first. I am sorry. That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and they are the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it. Whether you are a first generation or a 10th generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you. Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They have been loyal to themselves. The Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens, and that is one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night, North Carolina, because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you tonight, but it was not good. It is one of the reasons we had big victories, two of them in North Carolina, sanctuary cities. And plenty of people, even in California where they have sanctuary cities, they do not want sanctuary cities. The politicians do, but they do not want them. Right here in New Mexico, Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail. Now, think of it. They want to make your whole state a sanctuary state. So, when MS-13 comes in, and I told you before, we take them out by the thousands and they are tough. They are tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher. There is nobody tougher. I would say naive, but maybe it is much worse than that. They are naive, these politicians. The naive politicians, they do not want ICE to come in. They do not want to take these criminals out. And if you do not take them out and they are in New Mexico, I got to tell you something, folks. You got problems. You got problems. You have got big problems. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement. The Democrat party Do you notice I always say the Democrat party? You know, before I came, they were all calling it Democratic because it sounds better, right? It does. It is much nicer. The Democratic party is much nicer than the Democrat party, but their name is the Democrat party, and I am not looking for them to sound nice. I want to give their name. So, I always say the Democrat party, but that is their name, the Democrat party. Frankly, they should probably change it because it does And then I'd call them the Democratic party, but the Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Every major That is a nasty fly. I do not like those suckers. I do not know about you in New Mexico, but I am not into flies or mosquitoes. I do not like snakes too much. We have plenty of them in New York and Washington, a different variety. I do not like snakes either. We got a lot of snakes in Washington DC. We got a lot of steaks in New York. I do not like either kind of snake. I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in Washington. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed Medicare as we know it today. My administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. The Republicans will always do that. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years. You do not hear this because the fake news does not want to write about it. Sometimes I will have a news conference about something that is so good and I will say, you know I will call my wife, first lady, first lady. People love our first lady. I will say, Wait until you see television tonight, and we did something that was so great, whatever it may be. We did a lot of things. We did something so great and it will not be on, but if there is something that is just slightly negative or even if it is good that they could turn negative, that is what they like best. Take something good and turn it negative. It is breaking We have breaking news. We have breaking news. These are phony people, but that is okay. You know, when you think of it, I am president and they are not. Crazy. It is crazy. You know, sometimes I will be in the oval office and I will be with my people. We have great people, and I will say, You know, and it is great comm in the oval office. You do not like to hear about it because you do not hear about it too much. That is not what they But we have great comm considering it is pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right? But I will be saying, You know, they do not treat us right. They do not treat us right. It is not fair. It is not this. And then I will just sit back, I will say, But we are in the oval office and they are not. It is pretty amazing. It is pretty amazing. And when you have the Democrat party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake news, and they are partners They are partners, okay? Remember the word Manufactured? They used the word manufacturer on something, never been used for that thing, and every news gets The manufactured crisis started. The next one, This crisis was manufactured. Every one of them used the word Manufactured. They know what I am talking about now. Now, that is called collusion, folks. That is real collusion. You have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, their partners. Then you have the deep state. We are getting rid of a lot of them. I will tell you, we are finding them left and right. Boom. You take a look at what I will tell you what. I will tell you what. You take a look at what we are doing with all of the things. I am not going to get into detail, but you know what I am talking about. Clean the swamp. That is the ultimate cleaning of the swamp. And then I hate to say this, but we have some Republicans, they are not good. You call them a rhino. They are rhinos. The rhinos are worse, and some of them are worse than the Obama people, right? They are worse than the Obama people. They are worse than the Clinton people, but there are not too many of them left. They are pretty much on respirators. They are gasping. They are gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you would not believe. I did not hear you. Why did you say why? What? I did not hear that. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth, and that is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. It is true. Right? I see it. Just like mom, I see it. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialism. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it is the party of the American dream. We have achieved record funding for the US military. All of that money, trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA. And I have to tell you, New Mexico, I know you are going to like this. A lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion, all of a sudden you are in trillions and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions. A lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that is being used at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Kirkland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak. That is also jobs, but more importantly than even jobs, incredible. What you have done for the military, New Mexico, is incredible and we have remembered, but we are pouring a lot of money into New Mexico and that means a lot of good things. And we are investing in our nation's nuclear security, including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. To protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. Watch how that works out, folks. That'll be very good. I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And do not forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights. Do not forget, right? For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico. And you must never forget. Get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody. We need it because we are fighting a lot of forces, including Facebook, I saw, and Google, I saw. Did you see Google? He said I may have lost two-million to 10-million votes, according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two-million to 10.5-million votes, and we won. I do not know, we must be doing I will say this. That happened and people came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. They Came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is I know these men and women and they are the most incredible men and women in this country. They really are. They just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time, they did not want to get out there. They said, Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is this the best they can do? I mean, in all fairness, I do not want to go too early here. Look at the field. Did you watch the debate the other day? We have got almost 350-million people. I will take it. That is the best they can do. We will see. We will see. You never want to get too cocky. Somebody said in the great state of Texas, ENTITY is down two points to Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. They are phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told this story the other night. For six months, I was hearing that I am going to lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that look just like these guys. See these two guys with the hates? They might even be better looking. They look just like And they want to say, I do not know about you, but I know a lot about Texas and ENTITY is not going to be losing the state of Texas. Remember that? See, they do not say it is in play. They are too smart. They say Texas is in play. And Utah, they said was it play. All these are in play and play means we could lose them, right? It is a better term though because this way, they cannot get skunked, but they can get skunked with me. So, what happens is on that beautiful election Was that one of the greatest, coolest nights ever? Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you are winning by a lot. This is six months. Texas is in play. You know, he could lose Texas. I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to thousands of people, lines that are miles long. I mean, and every friend of mine says, You are going to win by a lot. So, they announce 8:00, whatever time, The polls in Texas are closed. ENTITY has won this state of Texas. The polls in Utah are closed. ENTITY has won the state of Utah. They do not even take a breath. Now, if it is close like it is in play, you wait two, three, four or five hours to see what it is, but they do not even a breath because they are called suppression poles and they are no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see. They are no different. They are suppression polls, and I will tell you what. We are going to win the state of New Mexico and I will be so surprised if we do not . I will be so surprised. No, we are going to win New Mexico. You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit. But I did not really have a track record because I never did this stuff before. So, I said I was going to cut your taxes. I did. I said I was going to cut your regulations. I did more than any president in history and they have been there for many years. I have been there for two and a half. And I think the regulation cutting Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you could not build a house, you could not farm your land. Now, what we have done on regulations is incredible. I have done I have rebuilt our military, I have taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out. If there is a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor. They get taken care of. We pay the bill. And for the first time, they have tried to get that for 45 years, they have not been able to get it, but I am good at getting things. You must never forget. The 2020 election is about one thing. What is it about? It is about you. It is. It is about you. It is about you. I am doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I am a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that it is about your family. It is about your future, and it is about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody. It is about the fate of your country. It is about the future of our great country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. That is what it is about. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today, very sad. No food, no water, no nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. And it is not just a little bit positive. Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. That is where we are headed. Together, we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration. And we are going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot done. You saw the figures last week, but we are doing it the hard way. It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years, and we have already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that. The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years. We have already started the process. It is been funded. It is been funded. Who would've thought that? Honestly, when I ran, I did not know that. We have now the technology and what they have done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years. We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs. Right? They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, okay? I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it is considered a hazardous waste site. It is all gases inside and you are supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container. Give me a break. I asked the people, the professionals, Well, what do people do when it breaks? Because they break all the time. What do they do? Nothing, they throw it away. A lot of people did not know. They did not understand. You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it is much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. The gases come out, they are dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for? And we are trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that they are less safe. So, what I want to do is the following. Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but they are safer and they are $3,500 less to buy, right? And the reason they are safer is because they could be a little bit heavier. Makes sense, right? They could be a little bit heavier. I mean, they make them now like paper mache. Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses. When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. No, they are made out of paper mache. They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, it is over. They say, What happened to that car? No, I think of it, it is safer and it is less expensive by $3,500 on average. And California wants you to do the other cars and we do not . We are going to end up in a big litigation and I am fighting for you. Look. Look, it is not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, Let them pay more. Let it be unsafe. They listen to the environmentalists, and I am an environmentalist. I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that we have ever had in this country? But what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff? What are we doing about them? We are going to keep our nation clean. But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right? It is so big that it is right next to each other. It is right next to each other. Does that make sense? Right? It is right next to each other. So, what are they going to do? We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and we are doing it now. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto. Nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down. In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it will not even be close, and we are right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. And every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to each and every one of you. Right? With your help, your devotion and your drive Gee, it is too bad. He did it right in the crescendo. How do you top that? I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home. It is all right. It is two people tonight. Remember, when they say Massive protest at the ENTITY rally, two people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of the great state of New Mexico, we love you. The best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Thank you, New Mexico. And together, we will make America wealthy again. Very, very wealthy. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumpnewmexicorallytranscriptfullspeechtranscript", "title": "Donald Trump New Mexico Rally Transcript: Full Speech Transcript", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-mexico-rally-transcript-full-speech-transcript", "publication_date": "17-09-2019", "crawling_date": "03-07-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 965, "text": "I feel grateful to have the chance here to join my colleagues to mark the anniversary of January 6. And I thank the Chair of the Rules Committee, Senator Klobuchar, for her leadership in all of this. We had an insurrection here a year ago that could have very easily turned into a conflagration if it had not been for the incredible bravery of the Capitol Police and the other law enforcement that was summoned to the Capitol, too late, but nevertheless, here. The National Guard, as my colleague from Virginia was talking about, they kept this place from being burned down. They kept people from getting killed. They lost their lives on that day and in subsequent days because of the trauma that they were exposed to. They suffered racial epithets that nobody in America should have to suffer shouted in the halls of this Capitol. T-shirts with the most racist, Holocaust denying slogans on them. And there are people here, as my colleague from Wisconsin said, who are claiming that they were acting like tourists. That is a really big lie too. This was an incredibly dangerous situation. And we were saved. Not just us, but the staff all over this Capitol and everybody else. I just heard somebody downstairs in the basement walking by and they were pointing out one of those pictures that is down there of newsboys standing in front of the Capitol when they were kids. And the guy said, Those were my great uncles. Because this place, for the people that work here -- I am not talking about the Senate, but the people that work here that are the staff, whose grandparents worked here, whose great uncles are on the pictures downstairs. To them, this is a family. And it was attacked. It was assaulted on behalf of people that came summoned here by the president who claimed that the election had been stolen from him, who was perpetrating a big lie about what had happened in the election. There should not have even been a surprise about the results in the election. There was little reason for suspense. And it is tragic that a year later, we still have to come here and say, Joe Biden won the election. And he did by any fair study of what happened that day on election day. He won Arizona by 10,000 votes. He won Georgia by 11,000 votes. He won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes. He won Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes, in Michigan by 150,000 votes. In every one of those swing states, he won by more votes than Donald Trump won in his election against Hillary Clinton. So this was not some razor thin margin. This margin was bigger in those states, except Arizona, than the margin that Donald Trump had won when he won the election against Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden won this election by 7 million votes. Donald Trump actually lost the popular vote when he won the election by 3 million votes. But his election was not seriously contended by anybody. And it should not have been, because he'd won the Electoral College. Just as Joe Biden had won the Electoral College. And he still claims the election was stolen even though there is no evidence that that is true. His own Attorney General said it is a lie. His lawyers -- Donald Trump's lawyers -- have been thrown out of more than 60 courtrooms by state and federal judges, some of them appointed by President Trump himself, saying that there was no evidence that there was fraud. A year later, there is been another incredibly expensive audit or review of the election, this time the election in Georgia. And you know what, there were four people down there who were dead who voted. Four people. They did not actually vote, they were dead, but people cast ballots on behalf of them. Four people out of 5 million and one of those cast a vote for Donald Trump. But President Trump continues to say that there were dead people voting all over the United States of America. The Associated Press did a review of all those swing states that I was mentioning earlier, and they found that if you just looked at the disputed ballots -- so these are not even fraudulent ballots, because they have not been identified as fraudulent, they are just disputed ballots -- that in all these cases, the disputed ballots came to about .15% of the margin in any one of these races. In other words, in not a single one of these swing states where there is a dispute that President Trump has brought, would it make a material difference, even if it were true, what you are alleging. Which it is not. And he is still doubled down on the big lie. And the result of that is, as my colleagues have said here today, there are more than 400 bills nationwide, in the name of that big lie, making it harder for the American people to vote, making it harder for them to register, making it harder for people to vote early, or to vote by mail. Because of a myth. Because of a lie, slashing the number of polling places, and dropboxes. In Texas, they are down to one dropbox per county. In Colorado, I can practically cross my street and vote at a dropbox. This is an effort to subvert elections to cling to power. That is what is happening here. And it is based on a massive falsehood -- the big lie. I think one needs to ask oneself, even people that support President Trump, what future does the stop the steal movement imagine for our country? What future do they imagine for this democracy where every election is going to be contested? Where political violence replaces the ballot box. Where elections are decided by strongmen, not votes, turning us into Russia or China. Is that really what we want our legacy to be here in the country? Do we want to be the first generation of Americans to decide that it is just too hard to do our duty to the people that founded this country, the people that fought from the time this country was founded until today, who died for the sake of democracy, that it is just too hard? That somehow our differences are unique, or so important that we are going to give up on our shared commitment to the democracy in favor of those disagreements? And I think we need to ask ourselves at a moment like this, what we owe the generations of Americans that have fought to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free. What do we owe the 158 million Americans -- a record -- who showed up during a plague, this COVID pandemic, to cast their votes for Donald Trump and for Joe Biden -- what are they owed? And what do we owe our kids and our grandkids? I think the answer is very clear, which is a stronger democracy, an economy that works for everybody, not just the people at the very top. And where do we begin? You know, Colorado, I think, is a great example, Mr. President, where we have made it a lot easier for people to vote. We have one of the highest voter turnouts in the country. I always have to say, especially when the senator from Minnesota is around, that we are number two in terms of voter turnout, Minnesota is number one, but we are coming for you. And that is the spirit we should all have. We should be trying to get more people to vote, not fewer people to vote. We should have vote by mail, we should have early balloting. We have all of that in Colorado, one of the highest turnout rates in the country, and no fraud. No fraud. So I am going to just finish by saying that we should distrust politicians who cannot seem to win people's votes with their argument, just as we should distrust politicians who attack the free press to avoid accountability even though that free press is enshrined in our Constitution. And we should recommit to each other and the democracy. Let me tell you something, Mr. President. Last week we had another tragedy in Colorado, another disaster. Boulder, Colorado started out this year with a mass shooting in a grocery store, some of you may remember that. And basically on New Year's Eve, we had a massive fire that ripped through neighborhoods in the front range of Colorado in Boulder County. 1000 people, 1000 houses were burned, more than 30,000 people their homes. And I sat there thinking to myself as I was with my daughters watching those fires on the television set, how much we actually need each other, you know. And there is a lot of evidence out there in those two days -the law enforcement that got those 30,000 people out and had almost literally no fatalities because of what they did and what they sacrificed. The Coloradans that stepped up that night and said You can come to my house, we will put you up in my house so that out of those 30,000 people, there were fewer than 300 people in a shelter that night. The reporters, the journalists, that were out there long into the night, reporting on that fire so that people might have some sense of whether their house had been lost or their house had been saved. The local county officials who have worked tirelessly after flood and after fire, and after natural disasters to come together to make sure that we build back stronger, which we always do in Colorado. And even, let me say, the federal government's contribution, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, because if there is one reason that we should be one nation under God, it is for a natural disaster like the one that is just occurred in Colorado. This is our choice. We either save this democracy, which I believe we will, or we let it go. And it is going to be on us. And if we let it go, generations of Americans are going to indict us for that. And if we save it, I think they will celebrate the work that we did here just as we celebrate the work of the people that came before us that made our country more democratic, more fair, and more free. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "bennetsenategovpublicindexcfm20221bennetspeaksonthesenatefloorontheanniversaryofthejanuary6thattackontheuscapitol", "title": "speech Bennet Speaks on the Senate Floor on the Anniversary of the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol", "source": "https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/bennet-speaks-on-the-senate-floor-on-the-anniversary-of-the-january-6th-attack-on-the-u-s-capitol", "publication_date": "06-01-2022", "crawling_date": "02-07-2023", "politician": ["Michael Bennet"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 567, "text": "Illinois is going to give you the greatest majority come November that any Democratic Governor in this Nation received. I want to pay tribute to your fighting Senator, the representative of all the people, all the time, Paul Douglas. I have enjoyed traveling through Illinois this afternoon with Lieutenant Governor Samuel Shapiro, Attorney General William Clark, State Auditor Michael Howlett, your candidate for secretary of state, Paul Powell, your National committeewoman, Dorothy O'Brien, your congressional candidate, Mr. Cole Baker, your State chairman, Jim Ronan. Now, my fellow Americans, we have come to the end of a long and busy and thrilling and inspiring day. Everywhere we have gone, from the time we left early this morning until late this evening, we have seen young Democrats, middle-aged Democrats, senior Democrats, Independents, Republicans who want to vote for a President in November that will represent all the people. I think I can tell you that the ticket of Johnson and Humphrey is going to lead this Nation to a great victory come November. Four weeks from today the American people will have made their choice. I have come here tonight to set that choice before the people. This is a great day in America's heartland. America today is the richest nation and the most prosperous nation and the most powerful nation on earth, and as long as I am your ENTITY I intend to keep it that way. Illinois is today the powerhouse of America, and Governor Kerner and I intend to keep it that way. Let me be specific: Today, for the first time in history, over 70 million Americans have jobs. Personal income after taxes has risen by $80 billion in 3 years and corporate profits after taxes have increased over $12 billion. The stock market has reached an all-time high. The value of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are worth $100 billion more than they were when I took office last November. Total farm exports have increased 25 percent. And in this great surge, Illinois has been one of the leading States of the Nation. Illinois is today one of the top States in the Union, as Governor Kerner said, in exports to foreign nations--both industrial and agricultural exports. Illinois today has one of the lowest unemployment rates of any industrial State in the Union, and I will tell you who has been fighting to bring that about--your own great Senator Paul Douglas. Illinois was the only industrial State that was able to reduce its public aid under Federal programs last year. Illinois today has more men and women learning more new skills under the Manpower Development and Training Act than any other State in the entire Union. In 1961 the unemployment rate in Illinois was 6.4 percent. In July of this year that rate had been slashed more than 33 percent. Since August of 1961, more than a dozen labor areas of Illinois have been taken off the list of areas of substantial unemployment -including your own great city of Peoria. I understand that a man who works in the Unemployment Compensation Service is afraid if things keep on going this way, he will be out of a job pretty soon. Yes, you are rebuilding Peoria. You have a positive program. You stand for something. You believe in moving forward. You believe in going ahead. You are not just a bunch of negative aginers. The excitement of rebirth is everywhere in this city. You can see it. You can feel it. It is in the air. We are moving on. You have new office buildings, you have new civic buildings, you have new highways, you have new motels. Yes, this is a proud, new city of the future in the 20th century, and you are entitled to 20th century leadership, and you are going to get it November 3d. One of your great industrial companies expects its first billion-dollar-year this year. All the signs read Help Wanted, Men at Work. And we intend to keep it that way. None of this has happened by accident. It has happened because you had the vision to rebuild your city. It happened because your State and National Governments have pursued policies that made progress possible, policies that insured economic growth. Let me give you just one example. The biggest tax cut in American history, recommended by our late beloved, martyred President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and supported by most of the men in the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, was enacted by the Congress. In that tax bill we reduced the tax bill of the average taxpayer by 20 percent. We created 130,000 new jobs in Illinois. We generated an increase in total Illinois income of $2 billion. We boosted State and local tax revenues by $160 million. We cut Illinois withholding tax payments by $500 million. Four years ago the mighty industrial and agricultural center of Illinois was stalled on dead center. Today, Illinois is on the move, and we intend to keep Illinois moving forward. There are those who say no. There are those who say stand still. There are those who say hold back. There are those who say retreat. There are those who say repeal the bills that have made America great. We say, Let us keep moving. Let us continue, and that is the choice before the American people this November. You have a clear, unmistakable choice between continuing those policies that have brought us to a peak of prosperity, or turning to policies that will wreck our progress. Let me give you one example: The social security system has made it possible for 19,700,000, almost 20 million Americans--one out of every 10 persons in this country--to live under that social security system and they are permitted to live their later years in dignity, with security. Now there are those in this land who believe that our social security system should be changed. They say it ought to be voluntary. Even members of their own party say a voluntary plan would wreck social security, it would bankrupt the system. Let me make this clear this afternoon, here in Peoria: This is one of the most important issues in this campaign. Americans are not going to gamble on social security. They are not going to risk destroying a program that has proved the bedrock of security for our older citizens. And the position of Johnson and Humphrey is clear: We are going to fight for and strengthen and defend and protect social security, and we are going to extend it when the Congress meets again! The Illinois AFL-CIO State convention meeting here in Peoria has fought for social security. Reuben Soderstrom and his colleagues have worked to make America a stronger Nation, they have worked to make it a better place to live. So has another great American, Paul Douglas. He was one of the architects of the Social Security Act of 1935, and through the years he has been its staunchest friend. This is the choice the American people have to make in November: Do you want to go back to the 1930's when all the doors were closed, when all the signs read No help wanted ? Or do you want to move forward to the wide open vistas of the 1960's? For 30 years, under 5 different Presidents, we have followed a course to a stable, prosperous, and good society, where child labor is outlawed, where minimum wages are guaranteed, where the elderly receive social security and the young find opportunity; where labor and industry bargain freely; where our Nation is safe with a defense system stronger than those of all the other nations on earth combined. We are not about to give any of those rights up. Working together, Republicans and Independents and Democrats alike, we shall go forward to the greatest goal: Peace on earth, good will toward men. The road to peace is not an easy one. It is fraught with many perils. It has many side turns. There are no short cuts. But we move along it and we must move calmly. We must move patiently. We must move confidently. We must move with resolution, and above all, as good Americans, we must move carefully and responsibly at all times. President Woodrow Wilson, one of our great Presidents, traveling through the United States, once said in the great city of St. Louis: Things get very lonely in Washington sometimes. The real voice of the great people of America sometimes sounds faint, and sometimes sounds distant. Well, we have to get away from Washington once in a while to come out and see the young Democrats and the great citizens of this land. And I think if Woodrow Wilson were here in Peoria this afternoon, he would not think that your voices sounded faint or distant, because he would know that we are here in the heartland of America, and that you are going to lead us to victory in November. Yes, all day I have seen your smiling faces. All day I have looked into your happy countenances. All day I have seen the family life, the mothers and the children of America here in the heartland of the great State of Illinois. And those voices sound powerful to me. They sound clear. They sound free. And when I return to the White House, and the policemen turn the keys on those locks on those big black gates, and I get to those few acres that are back of our house, it is going to be folks like you that sustain me in my labors and in my thoughts. It is going to be prayers like yours that give us inspiration and hope and leadership and make it possible for us some way, somehow, to achieve peace on earth. And I want each of you to know that you have a part to play in American history, that you have a responsibility as citizens of the most powerful nation in the world, that you have an obligation as Americans-whether you are Democrats or whether you are Republicans, or whether you are Independents-and that obligation is to go out and work and fight and give the best talents you have to make democracy live. Ten months ago, in a tragic moment, I was called upon to assume the awesome responsibilities of ENTITY of this country. And I told you that afternoon, after I took the oath of office in Air Force One, that I wanted you to give me your help and give me your hand, and give me your prayers; that all I could tell you was I would do the best I could. We had a difficult transition period because all the world was looking at us. Our great, young leader had fallen. And our own people and the other peoples of the world were watching what course America would take. You sustained me with your strength. You helped me with your prayers. America united--the businessman, the labor man, the farmer, the Congress--all put their shoulders to the wheel, and America became a united nation instead of a divided nation. America became a nation of lovers instead of a nation of haters. America became a nation of people who have faith instead of people who have doubt. As I leave you this afternoon, I want you to know that I have faith in you, I trust you, I know what you are going to do: You are going to do what is best for your country. You are going to do what is best for America.

{"id": 1054, "text": "Thank you all. Please be seated. Thanks for coming out to say hello. It is great to be in southern Illinois. I appreciate the chance to come to Madison County. I am honored to be the first sitting ENTITY to visit the city of Collinsville. I am sorry Laura is not with me. That is generally the reaction. I was hoping she and I could go look at the Catsup Bottle. Thanks for waiting on me. I had a visit with some of the some folks from the area here, a neurosurgeon, a cardiologist, the administrator of a hospital, ob-gyn, a patient, all about the health care crisis that exists here in this part of the world. And that is what I am here to talk about. I am here to talk about how we need to fix a broken medical liability system. I want to thank all the good folks who provide health care for the folks in this part of the world, the nurses, the docs, the administrators. Thank you all for coming. Thanks for your compassion. Thanks for your care. Thanks for taking an active interest in an important issue that faces not only this part of the world but the country. But really what I am here to do is to make say as clearly as I can, the United States Congress needs to pass real medical liability reform this year. And there is no doubt in my mind we have a strong ally in this issue in the great Speaker of the House of Representatives from the great State of Illinois, Denny Hastert. And I want to thank Congressman John Shimkus for his leadership not only on this issue but on other issues. It is good to be with his wife, Karen, again, sons, David, Joshua, and Daniel. Nice to see you boys. And you brought Mom and Dad. Your mom is probably telling you what to do, just like mine is. You are probably listening about half the time, just like I am. Welcome. I am also proud to be traveling today with a great Congressman from Peoria, Illinois, Ray LaHood. Thank you, sir. Appreciate you coming. The State Treasurer of Illinois has joined us, Judy Baar Topinka. Appreciate you. Tom Cross is here. He is the minority leader in the house. I will tell you what he is doing in the house of representatives for the State of Illinois: He is leading the medical liability reform effort. And I want to thank you, Tom, for taking a strong role. Appreciate you coming. I know the mayor is here. Mr. Mayor yes, he is here, Stan Schaeffer. I appreciate you coming, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate you being here. I usually like to give mayors unsolicited advice: Fill the potholes. You have probably got some advice for me: Pass the highway bill. I want to thank those of you who are working on this medical liability issue here in the State of Illinois. I appreciate your efforts. Look, it is about time the medical profession gets involved. It is about time you let people know what is on your mind. It is time to make sure that the issue comes to the forefront not only at the Federal level but at the local level as well. I want to thank Connie Bergmann. I met Connie. She came out to the airport airbase, and kind of airbase-airport combo, I guess it is. She is a volunteer for the American Red Cross. The reason I bring her up is, every stop I make in America I like to herald a citizen who is taken time out of his or her life to volunteer to make the country a better place. See, the great strength of America is not our military might, and it is certainly not the size of our wallets. The great strength of America lies in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens, people who are willing to love a neighbor just like they'd like to be loved themselves, people who are willing to take time to volunteer to make America a better place. And Connie Bergmann is such a person. And I want to thank you for serving the Red Cross. And speaking about the Red Cross, the International Red Cross is doing heroic work in a part of the world that has suffered incredible, incredible death and destruction. The American people express our sympathy to the victims of the tsunami disasters. Yesterday I spoke to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, who I sent on a delegation with a delegation to assess the relief operations. And they reported in that the devastation is beyond comprehension. They also reported in that they will come back with an assessment about how we can more effectively help. But they also reported that our military is doing heroic work in helping to save life. They are flying rescue missions 24 hours a day. They are making a huge difference in the people's lives over there by delivering supplies directly to those in need. Our Government has not only stepped up with the use of military assets, but we have pledged $350 million in disaster assistance to help the people over there who are suffering. There is huge generosity here in America as well. As you know, I tapped a couple of ex-President's number 41 and number 42, to help out. I asked them to help, and they are. My dad and President Clinton have graciously given of their time to help make sure that people know there is a need and to make sure the donations are properly channeled into programs that work. If you want to help, get on the Internet for the USA www.usafreedomcorps.gov. There is a place to help. And on that web page, you will find different agencies which are doing the good work. What I do not want is, I do not want people to be sending money to places that are not really doing the job. We do not need to support organizations that are not effectively delivering compassion and help. And so on this web page, you will find a way to help, if you so desire to do so. What they tell me is, the most important contribution a person can give is cash, and let the agencies on the ground be able to use that cash to best meet the needs of those who have suffered. I want to thank all the Americans who thus far have been participating in this urgent cause. You are showing the true strength of America through your good heart. I do not know if you know this: This is my first trip after the New Year. And it is good to come here to Illinois. I am rested and ready to continue to serve to be your to continue to be your ENTITY and to serve the people of this country. And we have got a big agenda item a big agenda and a series of items that we will be dealing with. First of all, we are going to win the war on terror. We have still got to we will be steadfast. We will be resolved. We will be wise. We will not give in to these people. We have a duty in your Government to protect the American people. So the second big task at hand is to make sure we do everything we can to protect our homeland. And I will assure you I will continue to work to spread freedom and democracy and, therefore, peace in parts of the world that are desperate for freedom, democracy, and peace. We are going to work with the Congress to be wise about how we spend your money. We are going to keep your taxes low so this economy continues to grow. We are going to continue to work with our farmers and ranchers to make sure they can sell the products overseas, in markets where people need food and beef and pork. We are going to work to pass a national energy plan. We are going to work to cut our deficit in half over the next 5 years. And I look forward to working with members of both political parties to do something about our health care system. First, it is important for Americans to understand we have the best health care system in the world. And we need to keep it that way. We have got the best hospitals, both urban and rural. We have got the world's most talented and compassionate doctors and nurses. And we have got the world's and we lead the world in innovative research. We are on the cutting edge of change. We are saving lives through our research. Americans should be proud of our medical system, and we all must be grateful for those who work hard to provide compassion and care. Our health care system faces serious challenges. We all know that. The cost of health care is rising rapidly, and that burdens our families. It hurts our small businesses. It makes it harder for the job creators to expand the job base. Too many Americans are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we have got to take those steps this year. To improve health care in America, we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It is a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do. To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply 21st century information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our Medicare system still allows seniors to have choice in the system. There is a lot we can do. We have got to make sure we expand community health centers around our country to provide care for the poor and the indigent. And we have got to make sure low-income children are enrolled in government health care programs so they receive the care they need. These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by the Federal Government but by patients and doctors. To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. World-class medical technology is expensive. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. But some costs are not necessary. And that is what the American people must understand and Members of the United States Senate and the United States House must understand. Many of the costs that we are talking about do not start in an examining room or an operating room; they start in a courtroom. What is happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. That is just a plain fact. And they are doing it for a simple reason: They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in recent years. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system today. It is a system that is just not fair. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients. When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern Illinois and the people of America must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. For some physicians, even raising costs for patients is not enough to afford the premium increases caused by these lawsuits. And so physicians are faced with a terrible choice: give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine. And that problem affects all doctors, from family practitioners in rural towns to surgeons in big-city hospitals. In 2003, almost half of all American hospitals lost physicians or reduced services because of medical liability concerns. Think about that: One-half of all American hospitals lost physicians. Over the past 2 years, the liability crisis has forced out about 160 physicians in Madison and St. Clair counties alone. When doctors move or close their practices, guess who suffers: the patients, the people who live in these good towns in this part of the world. Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose critical minutes in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. America's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That is why doctors practice what is called defensive medicine. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains some 60 to 100 billion dollars from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand. This liability system of ours is, what I am telling you, is out of control. And you have people in this area and the doctors in this area understand what I am talking about. A recent study ranked Madison County the number one place in the country for trial lawyers to sue. And that is a ranking I am sure you'd like to get rid of. And those of you traveling in from St. Clair County are not doing much better. St. Clair is ranked the second county in America where you are likely to get sued. In other words, if you see a team of trial lawyers spending a lot of time in the Collinsville area, you can be pretty sure they are not looking for horseradish. Let me share some of the stories of the folks I met with today. I think this will help clarify what I am trying to say to you. Dr. Chris Heffner is with us. He is a neurosurgeon from Belleville Memorial and St. Elizabeth Hospitals. Raise your hand, Doc. He is one of only two neurosurgeons still practicing south of Springfield, Illinois. You have got two people in the area. In just 2 years, his annual premiums have more than doubled from $131,000 a year to $265,000 a year. And at the same time, his amount of insurance coverage has been cut in half. A few years ago, Chris decided that closing his head trauma part of his practice was the only way he could afford to stay in this area. He told me he loves living here in this part of the world. He likes to raise his family here. He and his wife made a tough decision to stay here, in spite of the fact that his premiums doubled and he got half the coverage. And so the only way he could stay here and to provide a level of care that he wants everybody to have was to cut out part of his practice. He still treats dozens of patients with spinal cord injuries, but now brain trauma victims in southern Illinois have to be airlifted across the river to St. Louis. He said, It is very distressing. I spent years of training to do brain surgery. It is a big part of my life. I made a commitment to stay here, but I had to make adjustments to keep the ax from falling. The system needs to be fixed. Dr. Greg Gabliani is with us. He is from Alton, and he is a cardiologist. He was raised in Quincy, and he moved to Madison County in 2001, even though his colleagues warned him about the medical liability crisis here. In 3 years, his premiums have risen from $12,500 to $60,000 a year 3 quick years. Last year he had to stop performing certain procedures to bring his costs under control. He said, You either have to change the nature of your practice, or you have to leave. He did not want to leave, so he is having to cut back on his services. We have got a problem, folks. I met with Bob Moore. He is the CEO of Red Bud Regional Hospital. That is big Bob. He is a father of six, I want you to know. His hospital has a long tradition of delivering babies, but this past November, he made the difficult decision to close his ob unit. The malpractice see, he had the they employ the doctors in his hospital. They become the employer. They are going to cover the insurance for them, and it doubled from $150,000 to $270,000 more than doubled. They are paying $270,000 a year now. That is a lot for a little hospital in a small town. Maybe for a big hospital, it is not a lot, or for those of us who are used to dealing with the Federal budget, it is not a lot. It is a lot for a small town hospital. Red Bud used to handle 120 deliveries a year. But now a lot of the women have to drive an hour to get to an ob unit. He said, You would not get an ob-gyn to come here. It is affecting rural medicine. It happens to be the medical liability crisis, is affecting rural medicine. Lawsuits are affecting rural medicine. It is a societal issue that has to be dealt with. I could not put it any better, Bob. It is a societal issue that we must deal with. It is a quality of life issue. We do not want our little towns being not having any health care. We want people who live in rural America, like Crawford, Texas to be able to get to have a quality of life . Leslie Scariano is with us. She is an ob-gyn from Alton. She spent her entire career as a doctor in southern Illinois, and she has never been sued. She is a good doc. She shut down her practice on December the 31st of this year because her premiums have skyrocketed out of control. That means she could not afford to stay in practice. She had a choice to make: quit practicing medicine, or go broke. She said, I do not want to quit practicing medicine and I am not going broke, so I am going to move to Colorado. You lost a good soul from this part of the world because the system is out of control. Leslie's premiums will be about 80 percent lower in Colorado than here in Illinois. I met with Kim Vogel, who is right with us yes, there she is. She was one of Leslie's patients. She is expecting her second child early next month like, soon. When she found out she was pregnant last year, Kim started seeing the ob-gyn that delivered her daughter, Katie. That ob-gyn moved to Tennessee. Then she started seeing Leslie. Leslie is moving to Colorado. Kim is now on her third ob-gyn, and she is worried about it. She said, I understand the doctors' position. I do not blame them. But as a patient, I see them leave and I think, what am I going to do now, and where does that leave me? I feel like I have lost control over how my pregnancy will go. Unfortunately, this is not just a story confined to this part of the world. This is a story of pregnant moms all over America who are wondering whether or not they are going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, one, I understand the problem and I intend to work with Congress to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of Texas, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. And there was two things wrong with that strategy. One is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the State that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from one area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from one area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your Federal budget spends $28 billion a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for Medicaid and Medicare and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to Congress with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, 100 percent of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. Seems to be fair, if you get hurt. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages. And in the case of truly egregious wrongdoing, patients should be entitled to punitive damages. But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, the State of California has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in 1975. Patients in that State see their claims settled a third faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since 1975, insurance premiums for California doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most States. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the Congress ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, Congress needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. I know you do. I know the people of this part of the world understand it, because you see firsthand what happens when the system gets out of control: 160 docs leave 2 counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on election day about medical liability. The House passed a good medical liability reform bill last year. I want to thank the two Members of Congress for working on it. The Senate failed to get the job done. Well, the new Congress is starting over, you know. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the American people. Both Houses will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the House to get the bill moving. It is important for the United States Senators from this State and other States to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in the year 2005. Junk lawsuits affect more than just the medical field. According to a recent study, frivolous litigation has helped drive the total cost of our tort system to more than $230 billion a year. That is the equivalent of $3,200 for every family of four. The lawsuit burden falls especially hard on small businesses. And yet small businesses are the engine of job are the engines of job creation in our country. Seventy percent of all new jobs in America are created by small businesses. The tort costs in America are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. Think about that. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for American manufacturers and entrepreneurs. And so here are some actions Congress can take as well. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in Madison County. The number of class actions filed here increased by over 5,000 percent between 1998 and 2003, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from Madison County. Think about that. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed . I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the Congress this year. I will also work with Congress to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern Illinois and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of dozens of companies and cost tens of thousands of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. More than 100,000 new asbestos claims were filed last year alone. Congress has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. They need to act and get the job done. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in 2005. I think we are sent to Washington to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Congresses. I believe we are called to do the hard work to make our communities and quality of life a better place. And it is hard work for some in Congress to stand up to the trial lawyers. I understand that. But all we are asking for is fairness. We want our doctors treated fairly. We want the hospitals treated fairly. And most of all, we want the patients and the American people treated fairly. And I appreciate you all giving me a chance to come by and talk about the vital issue of legal reform. I intend to go back to Washington here shortly, and when I see Members of the Congress as I work this issue, I am going to say, I spoke to the good folks of southern Illinois. They understand the problem, and they expect you, Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, to get the job done. Thanks for coming by to say hello. I hope you and your families have a blessed and healthy 2005.

{"id": 957, "text": "Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he is done. And to CPAC I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third. Then I said, what the hell, let us run for President. Right? But it is wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we have done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world. They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 the Election, we call it, with a capital E it is never been done before. And we are going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger. And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just did not quite understand that. They did not understand it. I think now, with what we have done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well. And it is driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, There is no way to 270? You know what that means, right? There is no way to 270. They could not get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there was not any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one. But we did not need the one. We did not need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we did not need the one, because we did not get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called Michigan, where by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce. Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we are going to do even better in 2020. I think we are going to do numbers that people have not seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting America's interests, defending America's value, and reclaiming our nation's priceless heritage. It is true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It is been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It was not America first. In many cases, it was America last. Those days are over. Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents and I get along with them because they know that what is taken place over many years not just the Obama administration; long before that they cannot believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They cannot believe it. An impossible thing. And they like me. And the reason they like me they tell me; they say, Mr. President I said as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, How is it possible that you got away with this for so long? And he said, Because nobody ever asked us to change. It is true. When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent and they said to me, We expected that somebody would call and say you cannot do that. Nobody called, so we just left it. And I do not blame them. We should've been doing the same thing to them. But we did not . True. Right? Hard to believe. It is hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we are negotiating with China. They would not negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich really rich. The old tariff laws we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they were not terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we did not know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough. It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he will let us know on Sunday night. I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We did not know what to do with all of the money we were making. We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We cannot do that. We cannot ever allow that to happen. And, you know I do not know, maybe you know. You know I am totally off-script, right? Thank you, darling. You know I am totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we do not go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what is happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, No, no I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal I encourage it. I think it is really something that they should promote. They should work hard on. It is something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I will take the other side of that argument only because I am mandated to. I am mandated. But they should stay with that argument. Never change. Never change. No planes. No energy. When the wind stops blowing, that is the end of your electric. Let us hurry up. Darling Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling. No, but it is true. So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, Oh, it is okay for other nations to come in. I will not use a certain words because it is not politically but everybody knows the word I'd love to use. Should I use it? I will not do it. Our great First Lady always said, Do not use certain words, please. I said, But the audience wanted me to do it. She said, Do not do it. And the problem is, if I do do that, they will not put the little preamble that we just went through. They will just use the word, and they will said, Is not that terrible. So I will not use it. I have learned. Because with the fake news if you tell a joke, if you are sarcastic, if you are having fun with the audience, if you are on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please. Please get us the emails. Please! So everybody is having a good time. I am laughing, we are all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible. I mean, I thought like, two weeks ago, I am watching and they are talking about one of the points. He asked Russia for the emails. These people are sick. And I am telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it is ever been played. But the thing that we have done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people really, even conservatives good conservatives they do not like tariffs. I am not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion. Not like $200 million that is a lot. This is 200 with a B billion. Two-hundred billion. So but I was nice, because we are having a very strong negotiation, which if it were not for tariffs and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position. But in my case, it cannot , because it is true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here is the beauty: We have lost so much money with China $500 billion a year. And on trade, it is such a disaster; it is $507 billion a year. China just one country. We lose with everybody, almost. But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that have not done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country as it is turned out, because it is now been on there for a long while. Our and I am in no rush because I am fine with it. I am fine with it. Of the 25 points, we have paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. That is what the numbers are. It is very simple. You know, everyone said, Oh, it is a tax on our It is not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible. But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He is here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people. Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They have been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They have been fighting with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. Right? But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it is dying. So they do not have anything with Russia. There is no collusion. So now they go and morph into, Let us inspect every deal he is ever done. We are going to go into his finances. We are going to check his deals. We are going to check These people are sick. They are sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it is the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, We are going to look into his finances. I said, Where did that come from? He always talked about Russia collusion with Russia. The collusion delusion. So now we are waiting for a report, and we will find out whether or not, and who we are dealing with. We are waiting for a report by people that were not elected. We had think of this: We had the greatest election in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson. This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I am not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. This is Ronald Reagan. Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote. Those red hats and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. Make America Great Again, is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that should not be there. And, all of a sudden, they are trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? With bullshit. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, I am going to recuse myself. I am going to recuse. And I said, why the hell did not he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself? But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I have ever seen. All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he will probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why is not that mentioned? He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why is not that and I did not give it to him. Why is not that mentioned? Jim Comey Lyin' James Comey is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it is wonderful. So so everybody is waiting. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible. And I was on the way. But I will see it later. I guarantee I will be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It is called TiVo. I think it is actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? But I will be watching it later, Mark. But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report. I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I do not fire him. No obstruction. That is the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it is called obstruction. But only for Trump. For nobody else. So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he does not do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter horrible about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible. Every Republican said everybody in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, You know First Lady I said, Melania, I am doing something today. I am doing it because it really has to be done. He is bad. He is a bad, bad he is a bad, bad guy. That is been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. I am doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It is going to be bipartisan. It is going to be so popular, it is going to be bipartisan. Every Democrat hates him. Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady I said, But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan. Everyone is going to love it. So we fire Comey. And Schumer who called for his resignation many times Podesta, I believe that day because he still has not gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns. He called for the Comey resignation. Others almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every I cannot think of anybody that said he is doing a good job. So I said to Melania, Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing. And I fire a bad cop. I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, How dare he fire him. How dare he do this. And that is where we are, folks. That is where we are. We are in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We are winning, and they are not. We are winning. So, just to finish and I will tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this. He is saying, This is a lot more than we paid for. You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, Bye, folks. But you know what I like about this? Number one, I am in love, and you are in love. We are all in love together. We have done something that nobody has ever done. Right? It is easy. No, it is easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he is a stone-cold killer. He is a brutal man. He is actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was. But he is a very rich guy. And he said, What are you going to speak about today? Like, what are you going to speak? I said, I do not know. I do not know. He said, I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC. They are all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They are in many hotel rooms all over the place. You are just better at real estate than they are. True. But this guy you all know his name very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. He cannot breathe. You know, juh-juh. Are you okay? He kills people for a living meaning mentally and financially but if there is like an audience of nine, it is like augh. So he said to me, How the hell do you do that? And I said, It is easy. And the reason it is easy I really mean this there is so much love in this room, it is easy to talk. You can talk your heart out. You really could. There is love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It is easy. It is easy. It is easy. And we have had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It is been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat. We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I will tell you what: If we did not do those 32 rallies and it was not easy. When you are doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside. We were sending notices, Please do not come. That is a little different. Usually, people are begging. Well, yeah, like can somebody come? We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post a guy named David Weigel he wrote an article, some arena No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note something to the effect, Not very good crowd size, Mr. President. And I never saw it because I do not follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that could not get in he got there four or five hours early because he does not fly private. You know. And maybe it is because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that is it? Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just does not want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place had not started taking in people. They were not going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody. And, you know, whatever it was 18,000 when you have nobody, it is a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I do not think we have had an empty seat since we announced. And from the day we came down the escalator, I really do not believe we have had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It is been an incredible thing. And that is why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory. And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here Mercedes, thank you. They always say you know, they are good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, Do not bring it up. Do not fight. Do not fight. Everyone understands. I said, They do not understand. If I do not explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do and this particular writer had to do a I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot. He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they had not opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean how horrible. And I watched it by mistake. And they showed they showed from the White House all the way down. They showed from the Cap- they showed there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. Those pictures were taken hours before. Right? And they always mention crowd size. He talks about crowd size. So I am constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, Mercedes and Sarah show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before. And remember this also not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument. And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men and I consider them totally equal, so I am not going to say it is harder. In fact, it is probably, with the men I know, it is actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on I said to the people that were sitting next to me, I have never seen anything like this. Look at that crowd. And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd I have never seen anything like it. And I have to live I have to live with crowd size. It is all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day. People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, Sir, it does not matter. Nobody cares. I said, But I care. And people care. People care. So what I am going to do is I will give it to the great one. I will give it to Mark Levin. And I will give him the picture. Then I will show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field like nobody on it. And you will see the sun. You know, you can see it is very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? And you can have some fun. You are going to get big ratings on your show, I will tell you that. Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let us get back to what I am here for. And do not fall asleep. Do not fall asleep, right? Do not fall asleep. You know, somebody said, Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible. They said it was incredible. They said that was so great. And I said I said I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, What are you doing? A lot of it is not the people on television, you know. A lot of it is their bosses which someday we are going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you are building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we have ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country. And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We have slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That is an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it is gone, I do not know how they rule against it. Now we will have to find out. But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we are going to see what happens. And then we are going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world oil and gas. I got it approved. And I did not want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Do not get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I do not want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he is in the oil business. He is not asking for anything. He said but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, Hey and they all call me Mr. President. I have friends that, for 35 years, Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny. For 35 years. Now they call, Mr. President, sir. How are you? I have a friend a very rich guy Richard LeFrak, in New York. A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, Hey, Don, how you doing? I have known this guy so long from kindergarten. It is true. Hi, Don, how you doing? How is everything? And now I get a call the other day, Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you? I said, Richard, lighten up. Lighten up. Call me 'Donald'. Richard, call me 'Donald'. You have known me for I do not want to say, because I do not want my wife to hear the number. But it is true. Actually, that is true. That is actually true. Richard came up; he said, I have known your husband for 65 years. I said, Do not say that. I say, Say 25, 30. Do not say 65 years. But I said, Richard Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do. Call me 'Don'. Okay. Okay, Don. Okay. He gets his breath. Uh-huh. Two minutes later Mr. President That is called respect for the office, right? Maybe that is a good thing, right? Many many of my friends. And that was not in the script either, Mark. But we are renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we are cracking down and we are really doing a number cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades. Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they are closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio they are closing. They are closing a plant; they are going to move to Mexico. They are going to move to China. They are going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers. And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They are all gone. They are all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it is very, very hard prohibitively hard for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location. It is now a very costly they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it is costly. It is painful. It used to be almost I said I used to I have been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it is almost like we are giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I am for America first. That was not for America first. And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They are coming back in. They are coming back in. And, by the way, you know I am building the wall. We are finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It is in the thing. But and there will be some people in the room that do not like this. We are down to 3.7 percent unemployment the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place. This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we have been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they have got to come in legally, and they have got to come in through merit, merit, merit. They have got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country. And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It is sad. It is very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it is very, very sad. Very, very and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well? Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, Oh, that is terrible that he brings that up. But that is okay, I do not mind. I will bring it up. How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes. We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he is a free trader, so am I. I am a fair trader. I am a free trader. But when a senator said we cannot do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we are able to use this tremendous power that I found tremendous old stuff. Nobody even knew it existed. I am able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They would not even be talking to us because it is so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred this for many years almost $800 billion on trade. It is not sustainable. You cannot do that. And now we are making great trade deals. But when some of the senators good people; I think they are good people. I just do not understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it is 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing. So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It is called a mirror tax, but it is a reciprocal tax. Now, here is what I do not understand: I have had a lot of people Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey it is not his thing necessarily. It is not the thing that he is most adept at. But he is adept and he is smart. I said, Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci- If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, That makes sense to me. And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he is a smart guy, and he said I will never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time. I did a bad description. It is so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it is 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and do not like tariffs for whatever reason might be and that is okay. What is going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you are going to have zero and zero, so you will not have any tariff. Okay? It is going to happen. That is going to happen. But you have to you have to start working on some of the senators that say I cannot approve this deal. I say, You know what? I want to just charge India as an example, I am using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody nobody knows it because nobody knows what they are doing in Washington. But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous tremendous numbers. So they charge 100. So I say, I am not going to charge 100, but I am going to charge 25 percent. And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we are charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, Fellas, listen, they are charging us 100 for the exact same product. I want to charge them 25. And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. But I am doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support. Sir, that is not free trade. Where do these people come from? Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help the voters' help. Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they are very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. But they are smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even and I know they do not have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous. Campaign contributions they are very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I do not think so. I hope not. Because we are talking about our country. We cannot allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they do not respect us. They think we are stupido. They do not respect us. But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again. They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things and we want a strong dollar, but let us be reasonable. You understand that. With all of that, we are doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There is no inflation, essentially. There is no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we did not do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market? If we did not do quantitative and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that is going to be great for our country, not a dollar that is so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we have created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy. 5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent. It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American and you have heard me say this many times Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows. And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I am on the debate stage with one of these maniacs I mean, trains to Hawaii. How do you get to Europe? We have not figured that one out yet. We do not use airplanes anymore. You saw what I am doing in California, right? They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It is over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he is a nice guy. When I am with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. He called me up. He said, You are a great President. You are doing a great job. He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he will probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that is one of the problems they have. I said, You got to get those forests. We cannot keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It is called management. When a tree falls, you cannot let the environmentalist say you cannot take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree. It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he does not mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently let us say four weeks ago or so. He said, I just want to tell you you are a great President and you are one of the smartest people I have ever met. That is what he said. Now, that is what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. But that is what he said. And you are doing a great job. And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is it is okay. That is okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom. I like him. Nice guy. But they say things you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they are giving a news conference just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well except, of course, for the Never Trumpers. But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They are hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They are basically dishonest people because, look, let us face it: Whether you like me or not if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges. And 17 appellate division judges. That we have got the best economy maybe in our history. That we have got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we have cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it is for eight or beyond. That we have taken care of our military with $1.7 billion. Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have because I am a cost cutter. But and you are all cost cutters. But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end. And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we will leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It is time. Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It is time. It is time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire I said, General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate? He said, Sir, two years. I said, I cannot take it two years. And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places. And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I will tell you what: I was there I told my wife, Go to Florida. Enjoy your Christmas. I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House. But if you have got to have cabin fever, that is the place to do it, okay? But I was there, I do not know, for a number of months, through Christmas. I spent my New Year's all by myself. Do not cry. All it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, Man They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, I am in this mess you know, people do not know how big the White House. First of all, it is one of the most beautiful places in the world. It is really I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is 1799 which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say 1799, like it is old. To him, that is like a brand-new house in China. In China, they go back they go back 8,000 years. So that is that is like a new that is like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off. I say, Why? Because we are getting ready to land. We are an hour out. I said, What about the shades? Well, we want it better than that. May be like. So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty Air Force One. And we are landing, and I go up and I look. And I have landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they are doing, and these are the best in the world. I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, Sir, we are landing in approximately one and a half minutes. I say, But there is no runway. No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir. I say, I do not see it. I have pretty good vision. At least for my age I have good vision. I guess for my age I have great vision. But I do not have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, No, it is right up there. I said, I am sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there is no runway. Anyway he sits right up there and we land. There is practically not lights. These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we cannot land with the lights on 20 years later. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people. I met some incredible people generals. One of them came from Syria the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they were not getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It is not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I did not know. General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals there is no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, What is your name? Sir, my name is Raisin. What the hell kind of a name? I said, Raisin, like the fruit? He goes, Yes, sir, Raisin. What is your last name? Caine. Raisin Caine. I said, You got to be kidding me. It is true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star. Just like I did with Mattis when I said, We are going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname. So we changed his name. Called him Mad Dog. But it was not working too well. Mad Dog was not working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what is going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I did not have to go there. I did not have to go there. Because I meet and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It is one of the reasons I do not want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, Well, how do we leave this thing? So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants. And I said, Bring the cameras. I am going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing. And I said to the generals, Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left. It will not , sir. And I said, Tell me why it will not . It will not , sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster. Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week. I said, One week? I was told two years. One week? That is right, sir. We are only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over from the base that you are right on, right now, sir. They will not know what the hell hit them. They will not know what the hell hit them, sir. And I said, Why did not my other generals tell me that? Why did not they tell me that? I said, Did you tell them that? Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders. You are the first one to ask us our opinion. It is true. It is true. True. True. So I went back and I said, I am going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you are great. I like you, Raisin Caine. But I did say I said, Well, hey, listen, we are in Iraq. Is not that very far away from I was here in a very short time, sir. I flew right in. Of course, he is taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site my father was a builder. He always used to say, Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk. It is true. It is true. He'd say, You got to be on this site. You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they are ripping you off. You have got to collect every nail that is dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they are building, while they are under construction, is that wall straight or if it is crooked. And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down. True. You do not get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I did not want to do that. And I am in the White House and I was lonely. I said, Let us go to Iraq. And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq. And I will tell you, those generals not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true I mean, you talk central casting. These guys you could not I mean, it is incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he is the star of the movie. That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in a sergeant, a drill sergeant to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he did not . That is because Hollywood discriminates against our people. You know the movie I am talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we are making great strides, and our country is doing as well and maybe, in many ways, better than it is ever done before Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan if you call it that would lead to colossal tax increases increases like you have never seen before and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. And we have some great private coverage, and we have initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal. Under the Green New Deal which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student it is true. It is true. Who would believe it? It so it is so bad. But I do not I will be honest with you, folks. I said you know, it is Saturday morning, and I said, Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time? He said, Yeah, would you do that? By the way, everybody okay? I have not seen anybody leaving. I have not seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I will finish very quickly, because then I know. But I have not seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times a lot of times well, one time, the press said people left. Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. Two people. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, Oh, man, maybe this is not a good job I am doing. Then they came back. They went to the bathroom. And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we are now the leader in the world. We are the biggest now in the world because of moves that I have made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we are trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we are almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we will go probably another 30 to 40 percent. We need pipeline approval. We are going to have it very quickly. It would have taken it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We will pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that is not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay? So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I do not think so. It is not looking good. I think maybe maybe you are going to see some bad stock prices if that passes. It would end air travel. But you will get on a train, do not worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again. I do not think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years white hair. See, I do not have white hair. I do not have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she is ranting and raving like a lunatic. And these senators these senators: Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree. The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She is like she is like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she is standing in the hallway. And she did not know too much about the plan because she is you know, she cannot understand that plan. Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they are saying to her, What do you think? Well, I do not know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I am in favor of the plan. I do not get it. I do not get it. I do not get it. So she is in favor of the plan, but you will not be able to get to well, we can take boats, I guess. We will go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the and I do not want to talk them out of it. I do not . I do not . I swear I do not . This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that. I am going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it. Because they are going to grab out together, and they are going to say, You know, this guy is really laying for us. I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year. Because I have destroyed her political career, and now I will not get a chance to run against her, and I would've loved it. We got to you know, I do not want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that is actually got talent. That would be terrible. So I do like the Green New Deal. I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment. It is not about justice. It is not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It is called power for the ruling class. That is what it is. Look at what is happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism. And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I will say it again: America will never be a socialist country ever. Young Americans I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You have been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You are getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. Congratulations. You have been so great. Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you are doing. Where is Charlie? Where is Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance. The anger the unbelievable anger I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it is mostly pointed at me. You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas. These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there is a young gentleman with us today. There is a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face. Violently punched. And I said that is disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, Donald Trump attacked. No, no, no. Just for the media: I am sure he is a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum. I have been there before with those people. I do not want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where is Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here. WILLIAMS: Thank you. Thank you. So, at the Leadership Institute, we are committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It is great it is great that I am being recognized, and but there is so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus. So I am glad that we could we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it is as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public it is as important now as ever. And these students these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. I was going to call him, but I do not have to now. I see him here. But here is the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch. Because you were not going to go down no matter how that was a hell of a hard punch. He was a strong guy. But you know what? You have got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he is probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that. He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden here is the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That is okay. Go get 'em, Hayden. Today I am proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars. If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they have got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they do not , it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we are restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all. We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It is under siege. Be careful. But I will protect you, I promise you that. I will protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you are in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust. Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers our great, great cherished workers that now we are taking care of. They are not losing their jobs. We are creating those jobs. We are not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders. Because without borders, as I have said many times before, we do not have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly daily, hourly violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently. What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? Keep it open. Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I have been there many times. I see what is happening. I do not like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do and they do not have the backup of a wall, in many cases the job they do is incredible. These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing. And the paper does not write about it. The news does not write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that arrests. I am not talking about people coming in. I am talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder. Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they are doing it because I do not want to do it. It is dangerous. It is hard. But they love our country, and they are tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders. These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we do not want them. We do not want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we do not want to have to pay for them for 50 years. And all the nonsense you hear about the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have it is not true, folks. Okay? It is false. It is false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR F-A-I-R found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents. Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are the number is staggering. The number of illegals far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you do not hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world. Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy. Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word rape. The press went after me; I could not believe it. I said, Will it be like this always? The answer was yes. It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word rape. If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what is really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It is inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our I wish Mexico would stop them. Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It is 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We are working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we are doing. But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people. But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America? Uh, murder. She goes, What? Murder. I mean, what is going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to I have cut it way back. I have cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they are giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? Oh, let us send our best people up to America. Let us have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people. No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people. People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they are smart. It is so sad to see how stupid we have been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago. Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people and they are good people some senators, mostly I tell you, the House has been fantastic. The House you know, backing we have had from the House has really been I am talking about in the last short period of time. There is a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we are going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent. That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we do not want. They are going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That is the best way to stop that. They are going to do it anyway. They will do it anyway. I watch good people, they are friends of mine, We are very concerned with setting precedent. That is precedent not president. Precedent. We are very concerned about setting precedent. I am very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country. That is what I am concerned about. And the Democrats, they are going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it will not have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you they do not like it when I say it but we are being invaded. We are being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals. And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon. And you know what? That is okay. In Lebanon it is good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people. And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border. We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that is going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities. And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they are a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, Get the hell out of here. We have to take them through court. So we catch them. We talk to them. If they are criminals, or if they are not, we release them. We say, Come back for a hearing in front of a judge. You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That is the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial. It is insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we are fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they are born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks. It is so broken. It is so sad to see. It is incompetent. It is laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. Welcome to the United States for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen. This is like crazy. They used to call it anchor babies but they do not use that term anymore because it does not sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we are finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws loopholes. Well, I am finding loopholes to get around the loophole. Okay? Because our Congress cannot act. They cannot act. They just cannot act. The Democrats in Congress do not want to touch any of it. Visa lottery that is where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, Oh, here is a wonderful person. Wonderful. You know, he killed four people. Here is here is another wonderful. And then they get in and we say, Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody. How is that possible? Because they send us the people they do not want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations. Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We cannot do that as a country. We cannot afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that is going to be good for us in 2020. They are embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I do not think I have ever heard, in Virginia, the governor a Democrat stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside. He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he will talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they did not want the child, who is now outside of the womb long outside of the womb they will execute the baby after birth. They will execute the baby after birth. And that is one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They are lousy politicians and they have lousy policy. They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But but big but they always stick together. And the Republicans do not remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I cannot go and campaign for all of the people in the House. Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he does not need any help. He does not need it. I say, Mark, do you need any help? No, I am okay. He will win by 30, 35. They are okay. These guys you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them. I do not want to I could just name so many. They are the ones that win with that. I mean, it is like they do not even have an election. It is the ones that sort of they are a little shy about embracing what we are all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered. But the good news is they are all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory. We won for 51. And two that we did not like got out. They said they retired. They did not retire. They were retired. They said, These two senators have decided to retire. No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great. We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I will tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say Donald Trump suffered a big defeat. First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important. I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat. I said, I was not running. And one of the commentators and I appreciate it one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, Excuse me, he did not run. You know, not all our candidates were exactly great. Let us face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what is happening when I do run. And what they do not say is governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech. Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where is Georgia? Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue two great guys. Could you endorse him? I said, Let me check. And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper. And I said, I love this guy. He is down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that? I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party not Democratic. It is Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use Democratic. I even like I hate to say in the speech, the Democrat Party because it does not sound good. But that is all the more reason I use it, because it does not . They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it is much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I did not think she was great. But she is their star. And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama. And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them could not see properly. I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, You are going to win the election. He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis a friend. A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He is been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling. I said, That is right. But Ron DeSantis I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That is why I like Mark. That is why I like Mark Levin. And I am not sure a lot of people like him. He is tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, Sir, can I have your endorsement? I said, Ron, you are at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner has 22 million in the bank. His poll numbers are very good. He is up in the 20s or 30s. I said, Ron, do not make me do this, Ron. Sir, I can win. All right, Ron. Here we go. Because I know if he loses which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election. Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, I did not know Trump endorsed him. But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, Ron, do not do it. I said, All right, I will do it. He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida. He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others other governors, many other states. But I am not going to bore you with it. And I think I really think that it is incredible what we did in the midterms. I think it is incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, You cannot win unless you win the state of Ohio. We got the governor of Ohio, and he is great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything. And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks. And we got them Accountability. You could not fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They have hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You could not fire them. You had thieves that were stealing openly stealing. You could not fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability. Now you look at the guy, you say, Get the hell out of here. You are fired. Get out. Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they could not get it. And VA Choice, they thought for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice. You could not get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks people were dying. People that were not very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there is a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills. They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive. We get along. We have developed a good relationship very good and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that. You know, they are telling me how to negotiate. These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we have not given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I am going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I am going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out. If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal was not a deal that was acceptable to me. I do not like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I do not want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let us not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing. We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto Otto Warmbier whose parents I have gotten to know, who is incredible. And I am in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto. And it is a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have and we have had a lot. We are given no credit. They do not remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being these are big mountains. They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons nuclear testing. So much. We are getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies. We have made a lot of progress, and we will continue to make progress. And I really think what we are doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front. But you see, that is not what happened there. So already, I think we are negotiating. And I will tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they do not have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It is really a bad thing for them. So we will see how it all goes. But I think it is going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that is an important thing, especially when we are dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I am not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel. We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible. Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You are energized, you are mobilized, and you are engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America. I hope you can all come. Fourth of July keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy. And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I am watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I have been up here a long time. I said, Matt, is that okay? He said, I love it. Do not leave. But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read people left nobody left early. There has not been one person that is left. But when you read it, you just say fake news. This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag. Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We are hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank CPAC. What a job they have done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it is never been before. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementsremarkspresidenttrump2019conservativepoliticalactionconference", "title": "Remarks by President Trump at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference", "source": "https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-2019-conservative-political-action-conference/", "publication_date": "03-03-2019", "crawling_date": "27-06-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1080, "text": "Good morning. Today I want to talk to you about our Nation's duty to ensure that all America's seniors can enjoy their golden years as healthy as modern medicine will allow. I want to talk about my plan to strengthen and modernize Medicare and the important steps we can take to encourage older Americans to undergo health screenings that can save their lives and improve the quality of their lives. For 34 years now, Medicare has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. Last month at the White House, I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for the 21st century. The plan will strengthen Medicare by controlling cost, promoting competition, and dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to keeping the Trust Fund solvent until the year 2027. And my plan will modernize Medicare by matching its benefits to the latest advances of modern medicine. Since Medicare's founding in 1965, a medical revolution has transformed health care in America. Once the cure for many illnesses was a scalpel; now, just as likely, it is a pharmaceutical. That is why I made helping seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical care a key part of the Medicare plan. But even as we modernize Medicare with the prescription drug benefit, we also must modernize Medicare's preventive care benefits. Today, doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases earlier and more effectively than ever. And for millions, early detection can mean the difference between a full recovery and a bleak prognosis. For instance, if prostate cancer is caught early, the survival rate is 99 percent; but if it is not , the rate can be a discouraging 31 percent. In 1997 we worked across party lines to expand Medicare coverage for preventive services. But too few seniors still are using this benefit. Last year just one in seven older women received a mammogram covered by Medicare. For many seniors on fixed incomes, who every day must struggle to pay for food, rent, and other necessities, the cost of even a modest copayment can be prohibitive, and that can cost lives. It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its screenings might have avoided. No one should have to undergo a dangerous surgical procedure that could have been prevented by a simple test. No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care they need. That is why my plan will eliminate the deductible in all copayments for all preventive services, for cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other diseases. And because 70 percent of beneficiaries still do not even know about all of Medicare's preventive services, we will launch a nationwide campaign to inform and encourage seniors to take these tests. We will keep looking into ways to improve preventive care for seniors, including strategies to help them stop smoking. In the meantime, I call on older Americans to take advantage of the preventive benefits that already are available to you. They could save your life. We must seize America's moment of prosperity to strengthen and modernize Medicare for the 21st century. There are some who propose spending our new budget surpluses on tax cuts. Well, I support tax cuts for retirement savings, for child care, for education, but it would be wrong to spend our hard-earned surplus on tax cuts before we first have honored our obligations to our seniors and to all our families in the 21st century. First things first. I have invited leaders of both parties to meet with me at the White House on Monday to discuss the urgency of acting on Medicare now. We have an unprecedented opportunity to prepare Medicare and Social Security for the retirement of the baby boomers and to pay down our debt, to make America debt-free over the next 15 years. We cannot let this opportunity slip away. Together, we can find a way to make this summer a true season of progress for all Americans. Thanks for listening.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress121", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-121", "publication_date": "10-07-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 611, "text": "Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: I am glad to have the chance of being present at the formal dedication of this new building, which in its management stands in line of succession to a series of buildings, themselves typifying in no small degree the extraordinary development of the public school system of the United States. It was some sixty-four years ago that this institution was first established under a man of great eminence alike in the work of pedagogy and in other fields- Professor Biggs. At the time when it was started the public-school system of the United States had begun and was in the process of its first development. Now, in the city of Philadelphia in attendance upon the public schools, including the night schools, there are some hundred and seventy thousand pupils and over four thousand teachers. The development of the high school, especially during the last half century, has been literally phenomenal. Nothing like our present system of education was known in earlier times. No such system of popular education for the people by the representatives of the people existed. It is, of course, a mere truism to say that the stability and future welfare of our institutions of government depend upon the grade of citizenship turned out from our public schools. And no body of public servants, no body of individuals associated in private life, are better worth the admiration and respect of all who value citizenship at its true worth, than the body composed of the teachers in the public schools throughout the length and breadth of this Union. They have to deal with citizenship in the raw and turn it out something like a finished product. I think that all of us who also endeavor to deal with that citizenship in the raw in our own homes appreciate the burden and the responsibility. The training given in the public schools must, of course, be not merely a training in intellect, but a training in what counts for infinitely more than intellect-a training in character. And the chief factor in that training must be the personal equation of the teachers; the influence exerted, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, by the man or woman who stands in so peculiar a relation to the boys and girls under his or her care-a relation closer, more intricate, and more vital in its after-effects than any other relation save that of parent and child. Wherever a burden of that kind is laid, those who carry it necessarily carry a great responsibility. There can be no greater. Scant should be our patience with any man or woman doing a bit of work vitally worth doing, who does not approach it in the spirit of sincere love for the work, and of desire to do it well for the work's sake. Doubtless most of you remember the old distinction drawn between the two kinds of work, the work done for the sake of the fee and the work done for the sake of the work itself. The man or woman in public or private life who ever works only for the sake of the reward that comes outside of the work, will in the long run do poor work. The man or woman who does work worth doing is the man or woman who lives, who breathes that work; with whom it is ever present in his or her soul; whose ambition is to do it well and to feel rewarded by the thought of having done it well. That man, that woman, puts the whole country under an obligation. As a body all those connected with the education of our people are entitled to the heartiest praise from all lovers of their country, because as a body they are devoting heart and soul to the welfare of those under them. It is a poor type of school nowadays that has not a good playground attached. It is not so long since, in my own city at least, this was held as revolutionary doctrine, especially in the crowded quarters where playgrounds were most needed. People said they did not need play grounds. It was a new-fangled idea. They expected to make good citizens of the boys and girls who, when they were not in school, were put upon the streets in the crowded quarters of New York to play at the kind of games alone that they could play at in the streets. We have passed that stage. I think we realize what a good healthy play ground means to children. I think we understand not only the effects for good upon their bodies, but for good upon their minds. We need healthy bodies. We need to have schools physically developed, Sometimes you can develop character by the direct inculcation of moral precept; a good deal more often you cannot. You develop it less by precept than by your practice. Let it come as an incident of the association with you; as an incident to the general tone of the whole body, the tone which in the aggregate we all create. Is not that the experience of all of you, in dealing with these children in the schools, in dealing with them in the family, in dealing with them in bodies any where? They are quick to take the tone of those to whom they look up, and if they do not look up to you, then you can preach virtue all you wish, but the effect will be small. I have not come here to try to make any extended speech to you, but I should hold myself a poor citizen if I did not welcome the chance to wish you Godspeed in your work for yourselves and to wish you Godspeed in your work as representatives of that great body of public school teachers, upon the success of whose efforts to train aright the children of today depends the safety of our institutions of tomorrow.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthededicatoryexercisesthenewhighschoolbuildingphiladelphiapennsylvania", "title": "Remarks at the Dedicatory Exercises of the New High School Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-dedicatory-exercises-the-new-high-school-building-philadelphia-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "22-11-1902", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Theodore Roosevelt"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1065, "text": "Thank you so much. Thank you, Chief Emerson, Sheriff Kolender, District Attorney Phingst. Chief Sanders, thank you very much for the tour of your activities this morning and your statements. Thank you, Congressman Filner. Thank you, Madam Attorney General, for all the great work you do. I'd like to also say a word of appreciation for some others who are here who have not spoken today: our United States Attorney, Alan Bersin; the Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner, Doris Meissner; the person who was very active in helping me pass the crime bill which put these police officers on our streets, former Congresswoman Lynn Schenk, I am delighted to see you here. I want to thank all the officers who are here from the Customs, the Border Patrol, Immigration, from Chula Vista, from San Diego. I especially want to thank these uniformed officers who give their lives to make our lives safer and all the community citizens groups who work with them. Thank you all very much. Ladies and gentlemen, when I came to California and to San Diego 4 years ago and I listened and attempted to learn what was going on here, I saw an enormous amount of potential and a lot of stress. Mostly what people talked to me about then were two problems, the economy and the problem of crime and illegal immigration. I spent a lot of time here 4 years ago and had the opportunity to come back often since. If you will forgive me just one personal note, this is the first time I have come back to San Diego since the death of my friend Larry Lawrence, who served this country so well as our Ambassador to Switzerland, and I miss him now, coming back here, and I want to thank him for what he did for me here. Anyway, what we tried to do was to develop a serious approach, to work with you, to help you seize control of your destiny, and to help you do more of what you were already inclined to do. On the economy, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Because we are building two new ships for our national defense, the San Diego shipyards are busy, securing another 4,000 jobs until the year 2000. I think that is a good and positive step. Because in 1993 and 1994 the Congress agreed to invest in defense conversion, in high technology research and development and new environmental technologies and biotechnology, jobs are being created here that have a real future to grow in number and to strengthen and diversify the economy of this area. Because we have started work on a new sewage treatment plant and we are proposing to step up our sand reclamation efforts, thanks in no small measure to the relentless efforts of Congressman Filner, we are ensuring that the San Diego beaches will be enjoyed by children and their children for generations to come. But we all know that America has had, building over years and years and years, a serious problem of illegal immigration which has aggravated the crime problem along our borders. The Attorney General talked about some of the progress we have made. She gave me a report today which reviews where we are and what we have done. So as we have worked hard to bring the crime rate down all over America, we have made special efforts in our border communities, because we know that we have special responsibilities there. Immigration laws are national laws, not State laws. They have to be enforced, and the consequences of their enforcement or their failure to be enforced have to be borne primarily by the National Government. I have done what I could to get more money into California in very difficult fiscal circumstances in Washington to help you deal with the costs of illegal immigration-more than ever before- and I will continue to work on that. But the most important thing is we have to be able to work together to prove that we can do better. I agreed with what the district attorney said when he said there is a difference in being a safer community and a safe community. I agreed with what the sheriff said when he said that we'd never fully solve this problem until both the United States and our friends in Mexico are working together in a long-term and consistent way. But think about how far we have come in the last 3 1/2 years. Three and a half years ago, many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in America would return the very next day to commit crimes again. For a lot of years people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but did not do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words. It is a pretty good practice in a lot of areas of life, and I think it is worked pretty well here. Our message has been simple: We will work with you to give you the tools you need to patrol your streets, protect your children, secure our common border. And you have to do what you can to help the police to bring the crime rate down and make your community safe. Well, you heard what the prosecutor said: San Diego has the 5th lowest crime rate in the country of the 75 biggest urban areas. I actually believe when the numbers come out this year, you will be even lower than that. And it is a great tribute to the work that you have done together. Let me say, again, while the job is far from over-and we have a lot of work to do-the report I got from the Justice Department makes clear that we have begun to turn border communities under siege into communities where law and order and safety and security are once again the order of the day. I want to say too, again, I am glad that we are working to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America, that we are putting community policing in every community in the country that is willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it. Today I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the San Diego citizens patrol in the Safe Streets Now program. They are also helping your communities to be safer. The RSVP program is helping your community to be safer. So I ask you, do not stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you are surprised when you hear about a crime, then you will know you have got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it. The second thing we are doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they do not belong here in the first place, they are being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of January of last year, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem. We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We have added Border Patrol agents, in San Diego alone increasing by 762 the number of agents who are working for you by the end of this year. In El Paso, our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. Here in San Diego, control has been taken back of Imperial Beach from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built miles of new fences, installed thousands of watts of new lighting. There is more to do. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing San Diego residents in East County, particularly with the onset of the fire season. Today I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, to send 20 more law enforcement officers to Cleveland National Forest, and they will be there by the close of business today. Let me say one final word of appreciation here to the cooperation between the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials. What they have done here today, over the last several months-I mean, it ought to be something that we all take for granted. It ought to be the rule in every jurisdiction in America. It is a shame that it is rare, but it is rare, and we can be grateful that here there is one American law enforcement team. And I tell you, that is what we are trying to create for all the citizens of the United States, wherever they live. And I am very proud of what they have done. They have put aside politics and put the people of this community first, their safety first, their future first. That is why there has been an 84 percent increase in felony drug prosecutions in one year. That is why murders and robberies and car thefts have dropped so much, because they are all working together and working for you, instead of protecting their turf and playing politics. And I say, God bless them, we need more like them all over this country. Let me just say one other thing that affects Americans a long way from you, but I bet you have all identified with them in the past few months. Even as we crack down on illegal immigration and do more than has ever been done before on that, we must never forget that we are all a nation of immigrants and, except for the Native Americans, we all came from somewhere else. I say that to make this point: Our incredible diversity is a source of our rich potential as we move into this global society. Anybody who is willing to work hard, obey the law, respect their neighbors, and follow the values inherent in the Constitution ought to have a chance in America, and that ought to be the rule here. And because we are people and because we are imperfect, the country will always have problems. There will never be a time when there will be no problems. But we really fall into a dangerous trap when we start blaming our problems on other people just because they are different from us. I say that because even though I am a long way from there, my heart has been in my native South for the last several weeks as we have dealt with this incredible rash of church burnings. That is just another way of people finding a way-trying to blame somebody else or put down somebody else or put distance between them and someone else in a totally dehumanizing way, forgetting that everybody should be treated equally before the law, in the eyes of our fellow Americans, just as we are before God Almighty. And to burn a church is a terrible thing. Just 2 days ago, I reported to the American people about what we were doing to deal with the church bombings. And then barely a day later yet another congregation, this one in Greenville, Texas, found its church in flames. We have got to stop these things. We do have a team of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials working overtime to investigate these crimes. Just this morning, Federal investigators made an arrest for the burning of the church in Charlotte, North Carolina, last Thursday. And I do want you to know that for all the partisan fights you hear about in Washington, there is a bipartisan bill before the Congress, sponsored by a Democrat from Michigan, John Conyers, and a Republican from Illinois, Henry Hyde, to make it easier to prosecute anyone who attacks any house of worship, of any religious faith, of any race in America, and I urge Congress to pass it without delay. We need to come together as one America to rebuild our churches, restore hope, and show the forces of hatred they cannot win, just as we need to come together as one America to say we are a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws. If you want to be in our country, you should be here lawfully. We will protect our people. We will enforce our laws. We will secure our future. And we will do it together. Thank you, and God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia", "title": "Remarks to the Community in San Diego, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-community-san-diego-california", "publication_date": "10-06-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 812, "text": "Well, thank you very much. I greatly appreciate it. This is a beautiful room, I must say. I love beautiful rooms, and this is one of them. I want to thank you, President. And President, thank you very much. Good to see you again for hosting this historic summit. I am honored to be here in a city where, as it is been said many times before, the impossible has become the possible. And thanks to the 11 leaders in this room, I think that the expression will become the story of this incredible initiative. I want to congratulate you on the great job you have done. This region has special significance to me because, as you know, my wife, is from Slovenia. Right? We spoke about it. Very good. And she loves Slovenia. Every one of your nations has an inspiring story. You have overcame years of oppression, and you all are united by the hope that your citizens will flourish, your commerce will prosper, and your countries will absolutely thrive. That is what is going to happen, because I know the people. This is the spirit of hope that brings us all together. We are here at this historic gathering to launch a new future for open, fair, and affordable energy markets that bring greater security and prosperity to all of our citizens. We are sitting on massive energy, and we are now exporters of energy. So one of you need energy, just give us a call. On behalf of the American people, let me say that we stand with the Three Seas nations. Beautiful nations, by the way. Beautiful country. We support your drive for greater prosperity and security. We applaud your initiative to expand infrastructure. We welcome this historic opportunity to deepen our economic partnership with your region. It is been 28 years since your brave citizens lifted the Iron Curtain and defeated communism, yet much of the infrastructure within Central and Eastern Europe has remained a relic of the old Soviet era. It is pretty incredible. Your people have been held back by the old roads, railways, and pipelines that still operate on restrictive systems. The Three Seas Initiative will transform and rebuild the entire region and ensure that your infrastructure, like your commitment to freedom and rule of law, binds you to all of Europe and, indeed, to the West. The United States also strongly supports the creation of the Three Seas Business Forum so that your countries can build cutting-edge projects with the best talent in the energy industry, and do so under budget and ahead of schedule. I love that sound: under budget and ahead of schedule. Nothing like it. New energy infrastructure is essential to this rebuilding effort. We hope that the Three Seas nations will advance the same goals we are working on to achieve for our people in America. We are doing tremendously well. Our stock market just hit an alltime high. We have, I think, 16 years the in 16 years, it is the lowest unemployment rate. Our military is getting stronger and stronger. We are rebuilding it, adding billions and billions of dollars of new equipment, the best equipment in the world. We make the best equipment in the world by far. We are adding many billions of dollars of brandnew equipment. And the United States is doing very well, very strong. We have taken off restrictions, and people are really moving hard. So when I say that the stock market is at an alltime high, we have picked up in market value almost $4 trillion since November 8, which was the election. Four trillion dollars, it is a lot of money. Personally, I picked up nothing, but that is all right.Everyone else is getting rich. That is okay. I am very happy. Greater access to energy markets, fewer barriers to energy trade and development and strengthening energy security is what we are looking to do. The Three Seas Initiative has the potential to accomplish all of these essential objectives and very quickly because you have incredible people, and they will get it done quickly. I congratulate your nations for already beginning the critical projects that open us up to greater access, and you will be totally open and have access to energy markets and remove barriers to energy trade, such as floating LNG terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. Did you ever hear of that? Right? Huh? You know all about that. I will bet you know all about it. And the Greece-Bulgaria Interconnector. These projects and many others are crucial to ensuring that your nations continue to diversify your energy sources, suppliers, and routes. I also applaud Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Austria for pursuing a pipeline from the Black Sea. We just approved a big pipeline also, the Keystone Pipeline. It was under consideration for many, many years, and it was dead, and I approved it in my first day of office. And it is now under construction. And another pipeline besides that big ones Dakota Access. The United States is proud to see that our abundant energy resources are already helping the Three Seas nations achieve much-needed energy diversification. In fact, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and people of Poland for receiving their first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas last month. And you made a very good deal, I understand. Let me be very clear about one crucial point: The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so. You do not want to have a monopoly or a monopolistic situation. The United States is firmly committed to open, fair, and competitive markets for global energy trade. America will be a faithful and dependable partner in the export and sale of our high-quality and low-cost energy resources and technology. We make the best technology, and we make the best, best technology for fighter jets and ships and equipment, military weapons. There is nobody even close, and that is acknowledged. All over the world, they talk about the greatness of our military equipment. Nobody comes close. So when you buy and as you buy military equipment, hopefully, you will be thinking only of the United States. With the expanded trade and new infrastructure, we will unleash incredible energy innovation that is safe, responsible, and environmentally friendly. The United States supports a commonsense approach to protecting natural resources, one that responsibly balances economic growth, job creation, and energy security. We invite all countries to work with us to achieve this objective and to develop innovative technologies that empower nations around the world to be faithful stewards of their natural resources, while lifting millions out of poverty and into great and beautiful futures. The Three Seas Initiative will not only empower your people to prosper, but it will ensure that your nations remain sovereign, secure, and free from foreign coercion. The Three Seas nations will stand stronger than they ever have stood before. When your nations are strong, all the free nations of Europe are stronger, and the West becomes stronger as well. Together, our Nation and yours can bring greater peace, prosperity, and safety to all of our people. This summit ushers in the next great energy frontier. This is largely about energy, because we are that great exporter. We have just become what is going on in our country is incredible, and I hope you take advantage of it by using these resources. I am thrilled to join you today, and I want everyone to know that the United States supports your bold efforts. These projects will improve countless lives across the region and throughout the world. America will be your strongest ally and steadfast partner in this truly historic initiative. So congratulations to everybody. And we stand ready, willing, and able to help with your energy needs and other needs as they come along. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthethreeseasinitiativesummitwarsawpoland", "title": "Remarks at the Three Seas Initiative Summit in Warsaw, Poland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-three-seas-initiative-summit-warsaw-poland", "publication_date": "06-07-2017", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Donald J.

{"id": 1041, "text": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House and the Senate, my fellow Americans: I come before you tonight to report on the State of the Union for the third time. I come here to thank you and to add my tribute, once more, to the Nation's gratitude for this, the 89th Congress. This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America. Our Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam. Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you. It just must be the center of our concerns. But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people. This Nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home. And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight. I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year. I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty. I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth. I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America. I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins. I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal system from prevention to probation. I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing. I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the Federal Government by creating a new Cabinet level Department of Transportation and reorganizing several existing agencies. In turn, I will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both required as well as rewarded. I will ask you to make it possible for Members of the House of Representatives to work more effectively in the service of the Nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to 4 years, concurrent with that of the ENTITY. Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do. We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it. We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society. Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion. Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years. It will be only $1.8 billion next year. Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8 billion. Revenues next year will be $111 billion. On a cash basis which is the way that you and I keep our family budget the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus. That is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government next year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967. I have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures. I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans. There are men who cry out: We must sacrifice. Well, let us rather ask them: Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor? Time may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make them. But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty. I believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam. But if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the name of justice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need. And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight. Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber. The Great Society leads us along three roads growth and justice and liberation. First is growth the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress. I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already in every city and countryside. This Nation is flourishing. Workers are making more money than ever with after-tax income in the past 5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent. More people are working than ever before in our history an increase last year of 2 1/2 million jobs. Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent. Average farm income is higher than ever. Over the past 5 years it is up 40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone. I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3 billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your Government. We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year. And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land. It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight. I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago. Without raising taxes or even increasing the total tax bill paid we should move to improve our withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date. I hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of Vietnam require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed. The second road is justice. Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin. I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements. I propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime. Legislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the Federal Government, to 'prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. For that other nation within a Nation the poor whose distress has now captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience. To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources. For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14 of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the laws of the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures. And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest. The third path is the path of liberation. It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives. A great nation is one which breeds a great people. A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius. That alone is a Great Society. Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and which individual abundance alone will not overcome. We can subdue and we can master these forces bring increased meaning to our lives if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people. This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life. Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our Armed Forces. I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for the District of Columbia. In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people. Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life. I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas. Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air. We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people. To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces. Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets and that right just must be secured. Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways. I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy. We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores. It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention. We must change to master change. I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch, to modernize the relations between city and State and Nation. A new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our transportation activities. The present structure 35 Government agencies, spending $5 billion yearly makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great Nation or the needs of the industry, or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality. I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound in excess of 2,000 miles per hour. I propose to examine our Federal system-the relation between city, State, Nation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people. As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors. Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and State committees under the act to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions-and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice. To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives-which should not begin before 1972. The present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom. Today, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating. And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life. The Nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a 4-year term for Members of the House. And I urge your swift action. Tonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam. That conflict is not an isolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since World War II. The touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States the welfare and the freedom of the people of the United States. But nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass. In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster. An America that is mighty beyond description-yet living in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man. In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin. In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world. And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice. In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam. Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents. The first principle is strength. Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments. We will need expenditures of $58.3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might. While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire Federal budget will rise this coming year by only $.6 billion. This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the other departments of Government. A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction. We will vigorously pursue existing proposals-and seek new ones to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world. By strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by meeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world. We will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for Progress, the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the regional organizations of developing continents, and that supreme association the United Nations. We will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to trade, and to improve international finance. A fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man. From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands. This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves. We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance. We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture. We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children. To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966. I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts. In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world. The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institutions. For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself. We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule. We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of one race by another. We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe. And I will ask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West. The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of today's world in which we live. In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will. It is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire. In recent months a number of nations have east out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland China. History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people. History does not favor a single system or belief unless force is used to make it so. That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba-and tonight in Vietnam. For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young Americans die in a distant land. Tonight, as so many nights before, the American Nation is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom. How many times in my lifetime and in yours have the American people gathered, as they do now, to hear their ENTITY tell them of conflict and tell them of danger? Each time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this Nation required. And they do again tonight in Vietnam. Not too many years ago Vietnam was a peaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent Communist government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of the United States. There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people. But their progress was slight. Their hope of success was dim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest. And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression. As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We stayed. And we will stay until aggression has stopped. We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's solemn pledge a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American ENTITYs. We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and in America's protection. To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet the appetite of aggression. We would have to fight in one land, and then we would have to fight in another or abandon much of Asia to the domination of Communists. And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest. Last year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again. Swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the South. Attack and terror increased, spurred and encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near. Despite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold back the mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the South, and to make our firmness clear to the North. Thus. we began limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam. We increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 men. These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success. The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of Americans and their allies and by the enduring courage of the South Vietnamese who, I can tell you, have lost eight men last year for every one of ours. The enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side. There is no cause to doubt the American commitment. Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace. In 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam, with friends and adversaries throughout the world. Since Christmas your Government has labored again, with imagination and endurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement. For 20 days now we and our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam. Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more than 40 countries. We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all 113 that we have relations with, and some that we do not . We have talked to the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace. In public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and to friends, in Rome and Warsaw, in Paris and Tokyo, in Africa and throughout this hemisphere, America has made her position abundantly clear. We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military alliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of self-determination that the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course, choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without fear. The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification. This is all we want for South Vietnam. It is all the people of South Vietnam want. And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard. We have also made it clear from Hanoi to New York that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962. We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any proposals four points or fourteen or forty and we will consider the views of any group. We will work for a cease-fire now or once discussions have begun. We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future. We have said all this, and we have asked-and hoped and we have waited for a response. So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure. We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to our own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes. We have found understanding and support. And we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace. I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future may require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard conference, or even both at once. Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South Vietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger. But we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and every dollar, and every decision whatever the cost or whatever the challenge. And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war. And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle. There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will. But for others it must now be clear the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose. The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education the chance to build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny. For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs. It is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will, and so many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death. To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight: Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the servant of life. In this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve. This is the State of the Union. But over it all wealth, and promise, and expectation lies our troubling awareness of American men at war tonight. How many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other wars? How very many are not here to listen? The war in Vietnam is not like these other wars. Yet, finally, war is always the same. It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise. It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate. Therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world. Many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me. But there is a difference. For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire, against all the most inward pulls of my desire. For we have children to teach, and we have sick to be cured, and we have men to be freed. There are poor to be lifted up, and there are cities to be built, and there is a world to be helped. Yet we do what we must. I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires. Yet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble. I believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk. And from that belief your ENTITY summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come. The work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth. Thank you, and goodnight.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsannualmessagethecongressthestatetheunion27", "title": "Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/annual-message-the-congress-the-state-the-union-27", "publication_date": "12-01-1966", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

{"id": 643, "text": "Welcome, everyone. I am , of course, very grateful to Dan Quayle, our Vice President, for his hard work on the issue that I want to discuss today, and to many of you here who have been very helpful in all of this. I want to single out our nominee for Attorney General, Bill Barr, the Acting Attorney General, and Ken Starr, the Solicitor General who headed the working group that produced what I think is a very fine report. A little more than 2 months ago, the Vice President outlined our agenda for civil justice reform before the American Bar Association. That speech unleashed a national debate, a flurry of mail here at the White House, I might add, and some of the best lawyer jokes that I have heard in years. But we are not here today to make an easy hit on lawyers. Frankly, I do not think that the problem rests with lawyers; the problem stems from a legal system that just spun out of control. Sadly, we have become the most litigious society in the world. In order to restore sanity to our civil justice system, the Competitiveness Council that the Vice President chairs has recommended extensive and concrete steps that we can take, starting today, to get our legal system back on track. There is 50 recommendations, and these 50 recommendations include changes in the rules of discovery, adoption in certain areas of the loser pays rule, encouragement of alternative dispute resolution, caps on punitive damages, and changes in the rules and expert evidence to end the use of junk science on the witness stand. I have named only a few of our many recommendations. Some of these proposals require Federal legislation, and we are going to be transmitting that up to the Congress very, very soon. Other proposals require action by the Supreme Court. Today's Executive order will apply most of these recommendations, where possible, to the Federal Government. And I am asking every agency head, many here today, to do everything possible to fully and effectively implement the Executive order. With all that said, let me get to the heart of the matter. Civil justice reform is absolutely essential to our country's well-being. I am talking about access to health care and quality of life. Parents are having a tough time finding an obstetrician just out there in some of the States because many obstetricians found it was not worth it to practice anymore. I am talking about beneficial new products that never reach the marketplace at all because of liability concerns. I am talking about jobs. We got a letter the other day from an architect in California named Charles Yaeger. Here is what he wrote, I have many friends who are going out of business because of fear of lawsuits. And I am talking about inflation and consumer prices. The owner of Zaun's Trustworthy Hardware in Iowa, Brad Zaun, wrote to us as follows: As a business owner myself, the liability insurance is getting out of hand. The manufacturers could significantly lower their prices both wholesale and retail, which would stimulate our economy. Maybe other countries do not have this problem because every other Western democracy has the loser pays rule in order to discourage senseless lawsuits. Maybe it is because we have most of the world's lawyers here in America. Maybe it is because the pop culture in this country encourages lawsuits. I do not know how many of you watch Hulk Hogan in the movie, but he is got a brand new movie out there, and at one point he asks the bad guys if they are going to beat him up. You know what the bad guys replied? Hey, this is the nineties; we are going to sue you. People around the country understand that, and they have understood it for some time. And we have got to get something done about it. You see the problem everywhere. From the hindrance of new medicines to local bans of firework displays on the Fourth of July, the fear of outlandish litigation has begun to strangle the American dream. Americans understand that civil justice reform means growth, competitiveness, and jobs. That is why I feel so strongly about these recommendations by Dan Quayle's Competitiveness Council. This is not a partisan issue; we keep making that point. It is a matter of overcoming the vested interests and changing the status quo to ensure a better and most prosperous life for all Americans. The Federal Government is the largest single consumer of legal resources. As the client, I am asking you, the Government's top lawyers, to help us change the status quo. The Executive order will hold you to higher standards than private practitioners. But it will also give us the opportunity to lead the country by example toward civil justice reform. Today we are taking the first step. And now I want to invite Bill Barr and Ken Starr to join Dan Quayle and me up here as I sign this Executive order. And again, thank you all very much for coming.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningtheexecutiveorderciviljusticereform", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Executive Order on Civil Justice Reform", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-executive-order-civil-justice-reform", "publication_date": "23-10-1991", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 882, "text": "Well, I have got two short statements I want to read to you to start things off with. Secretary Morgenthau has told me about the shocking cases of tax evasion his men have discovered, and I am thoroughly in sympathy with his plan to enlarge the Bureau of Internal Revenue forces to whatever extent is required to insure full compliance with the law. At this point the statement, as released by the White House, continues as follows: It will be good business for the Government, because every dollar we spend in collection and enforcement will produce $20 or more in revenue. And much more important is the matter of good morals. We are not fighting this war to make millionaires, and certainly we are not going to allow the black market operators or any other racketeers to be in a favored class, when the men in the armed forces, and our citizens generally, are sacrificing so heavily. Yesterday, I acquainted the top officials of the Civil Service Commission with our special tax drive and the necessity for an accelerated program of recruitment. Arrangements have been made with the Civil Service Commission to have placed at every Army discharge center in the United States a qualified recruitment officer from the Civil Service Commission, fully versed in our recruitment requirements, who will steer to us the qualified veterans as they are discharged. The following final paragraph appears in the White House release of the statement: The American people understand that sacrifices are necessary. They know the war is still far from being over. The one thing that might break down their will to keep on to complete victory would be a feeling that a few were profiting from the sacrifices of the many. We must see that there is no justification for any such feeling, and that is just what we are going to do. I think there will be enough discharged veterans, probably, with the qualifications to meet this 10,000-man-program that Mr. Morgenthau is asking for. It is a crime to--a terrible crime, in my opinion, to find these people who are hoarding money and living off the black markets, and things of that sort, when the sons of the rest of the population are out getting killed to save the country. And we are going to try to put a stop to it. I have another short statement I would like to make, with regard to prisoners of war. I wish to express my very deep sympathy for the relatives of those members of our armed forces who have the misfortune still to be held as prisoners of war by the enemy. The welfare of these men is a matter of deep concern to me, and I am determined to do everything possible to help them and to bring about their release as soon as possible. To this end, every effort is being made to get relief supplies and mail through to them. At the same time, definitive information is being sought concerning the names of those men who are still held as prisoners of war. The eventual liberation of these prisoners will be the result of the victory of our armed forces, and depends upon unrelenting prosecution of the war effort by every American. These prisoners, of course, are the ones that are held by the Japanese. There are still a great many of our men who were captured in the Philippines, who are held in Manchuria and other places. We are trying our best to do what we can for them under the circumstances. And I hope we will really get something done for them.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference370", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-370", "publication_date": "01-06-1945", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

{"id": 774, "text": "Good evening. President Kim, Mrs. Kim, members of the Korean delegation, distinguished guests, Hillary and I welcome you to the White House. On our two trips to Korea, we experienced the great kindness of the Korean people. We hope you have experienced that same feeling from the American people. As you can see from looking around this room, the American people include more than 1 million Korean-Americans who make very strong contributions to the United States but never forget their brothers and sisters half a world away. Mr. President, I hope you consider America your second home. I recall very well the day in 1992 we first met on the steps of the City Hall in Los Angeles, where we also met with citizens who were starting to rebuild their community after intense racial strife. You spent much of your period of exile in our country, and you have many great friends here, some of whom are with us tonight. They have stood by you through times of trouble, and in turn, you have been a real inspiration to them. In one of the many letters to your family from your prison cell, you recalled an old adage: Even if the heavens were to crash down, there is a hole through which to rise up; and even if taken in a tiger's teeth, there is a way to survive. Mr. President, the story of your way is almost unbelievable: Raised on an island with no paved roads or electricity, you were captured by the North Koreans in the war and nearly executed; elected to the national assembly only days before the assembly was disbanded by a coup; denied the Presidency in 1971 after voter intimidation and fraud by the ruling party; injured when a 14-ton truck tried to ram your car; kidnapped, taken to sea, prepared for drowning by Government agents; sentenced to death again in 1981 after a 6-minute trial. Through it all, you never lost hope that democracy and human rights could rise up in your beloved land. Now you are at the center of that democracy working to make the dreams of your people a reality. You are an inspiration, not only to your fellow Koreans but to people all around the world who seek freedom and a better life. Tonight we celebrate your triumphs and the triumph of democracy in so many nations that once were ruled by the iron hand of dictatorship. We also remember with gratitude those who bravely struggled for freedom but gave their lives before their dreams were realized. And we honor those around the world who still struggle to free their countries from tyranny. Their struggles and yours, Mr. President, remind us that we must never take freedom for granted. As Abraham Lincoln, whose life and words you have studied, once said, The fight must go on. The cause of liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one, or even 100 defeats. Mr. President, you remind us that, at the end of all the defeats and all the trials, there is victory for the human spirit. Therefore, it is a great honor for me to ask all of you to join in a toast to President Kim, Mrs. Kim, the people of the Republic of Korea, the deep friendship between our nations, and the brilliant future for Korea that you will build.

{"id": 1044, "text": "My fellow Americans: In my last radio address, I discussed my decision not to impose quotas or tariffs on footwear imports. Protectionism, I said, costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs. Instead of closing down markets at home and throwing Americans out of work, we should be stepping up our efforts to open markets abroad and create American jobs by increasing exports. I instructed the United States Trade Representative to begin investigations of unfair trading practices on the part of our trading partners. We have the authority to counter unfair trading practices by initiating investigations, entering negotiations, and taking active countermeasures if those negotiations are unsuccessful. Therefore, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative to start proceedings in three cases of unfair trade: one, against a Korean law that prohibits fair competition of U.S. life and fire insurance firms in the Korean market in direct contradiction of treaty obligations; two, against a Brazilian law that has restricted U.S. exports of computers and related products and squeezed out some American computer firms operating there; and three, against restrictive practices dealing with tobacco products in Japan that unfairly block U.S. entry into that market. I have also ordered acceleration of ongoing efforts to open up Japanese markets in leather and leather footwear and to challenge the European Community's subsidies on canned fruit. On these two cases we are setting a deadline of December 1, 1985. I have directed that a list be prepared of countermeasures which will be taken if these disputes are not resolved by then. We hope that through these negotiations we will be able to convince our trading partners to stop their unfair trading practices and open those markets that are now closed to American exports. We will take countermeasures only as a last resort, but our trading partners should not doubt our determination to see international trade conducted fairly with the same rules applicable to all. I am committed to and will continue to fight for fair trade. American exporters and American workers deserve a fair shake abroad, and we intend to see they get it. Our objective will always be to make world trading partnerships freer and fairer for all. So, while we will use our powers as a lever to open closed doors abroad, we will continue to resist protectionist measures that would only raise prices, lock out trade, and destroy the jobs and prosperity trade brings to all. There are no winners in a trade war, only losers. As we take these important steps to make our trading system freer and fairer, let us also look at the subject of trade in its broader context. Some point to our trade deficit with alarm, but our share of world exports has not declined. In 1980 our share of world exports was just below 12 percent; in 1984 it was just over 12 percent. We have a trade deficit not because exports are declining but because imports are rising at a much more rapid pace. Why? Because our economy is, in a sense, out of balance with many of our trading partners. The strong growth of the U.S. economy has simply not been matched by many countries abroad. Our tax cuts ignited a noninflationary economic expansion that has put over 8 million Americans to work in the last 33 months alone. In fact, numbers released yesterday showed a dramatic drop in overall unemployment to 6.9 percent, the lowest in 5 years. Contrast that to Europe where a mix of protectionist policies and continued high tax rates have produced economic anemia and where they have actually lost jobs overall in the last 10 years. And many developing countries with massive debts, high taxes, and low or negative growth find it difficult to afford U.S. exports; some look to our strong dollar as the culprit. And, yes, a strong dollar does make it harder for American firms to sell their products abroad, but the strong dollar is a reflection of America's economic strength. Low taxes and low inflation make America an attractive place to invest. We can either balance the trade deficit up by encouraging our trading partners to adopt the high-growth policies of tax cuts and open markets, or we can balance down by adopting the no growth policies of tax hikes and protectionism. The choice is clear. Let us take the high road to prosperity by fighting for an open, free, and fair trading system with our economic partners and by encouraging them to adopt low tax, high employment growth policies. And let us keep our engines of growth humming here at home, too, by passing a new tax plan for America, a fair share tax plan for all. Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationfreeandfairtrade", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-free-and-fair-trade", "publication_date": "07-09-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1017, "text": "I do not know how many of you are thinking of going with me up to the Adirondacks, as many as can I hope. Those who go I shall see up there. Those who stay in Washington I shall not of course see, and I wish to take this opportunity to express my amazement at the constant correctness of my views as you report them to the country. It is very seldom that any error creeps in. I do not know how that could be done. I would not be able to report as correctly the views of any one of you. I do not know how you get before the country so clearly and so well my views as you do. And I also want to thank you for the consideration with which you have always treated the Presidential office during the time that I have been President. It has been very helpful to me in the transaction of the public business and I think very helpful to the country in coming to a comprehension of what the Government is trying to do, how it is trying to function, what efforts it is making to benefit the condition of the people. I hope those of you that stay here or go to some other part of the country will have the opportunity to have as pleasant a summer as I expect to have and as those who go with me I know will have. I would like to say also that I am very much gratified with the work that the Congress did. There was a very large amount of constructive legislation. The principal thing that will affect the country is the reduction of taxation. I was not able to do a great lot with the reduc-tion of expenditures, but we did keep expenditures down fairly well. There was no bill of general importance that passed that I did not approve. There were three or four small things. I sent up a couple of veto messages of personal and local significance and there were three or four bills that I decided not to sign. One of them I had not been able to make up my mind about it. That is the bill relative to taxation of lands in Oregon and Washington. That did not come in until just as I was about to leave the office to go to lunch and from lunch to the Capitol, so I did not have a chance to investigate it. I am investigating it now to see whether I ought to approve it or leave it disapproved. The tax measure I would say was the most important piece of legislation. The approval of the World Court and the manifest desire to place that on a basis where its independence would be made more secure than it is now, leaving the other nations to approve that policy, is a matter of importance in international relations. I think that there was not much of anything in the way of treaties. The Lausanne treaty and the treaty relative to the sale of arms and the use of gas did not come up for final consideration. The Railroad Labor Bill will we hope develop into a very important policy, because of the significance of it of leaving the management of the railroads and the employees to agree among themselves with the very manifest disposition of a new desire on their part to harmonize difficulties that may arise and adjust them without the interference of the Government. And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the Treasury. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to the Post Office Department. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through the summer months in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by the Navy Air Board, a considerable step in advance. There are some things that remain to be done. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in the fall as a result of conferences between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Cooperative Farm Associations that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. There are some things that have been left undone. Muscle Shoals has not been finally determined. I spoke of the two treaties. Coal legislation has not been finally passed upon. And legislation for the consolidation of railroads. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this Congress. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that did not have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the Congress act upon I secured favorable action. I do not want to make the personal pronoun there too large. I happened to express it in that way. I think some of the success of the present Congress was due to the fact that they assumed very largely their own responsibility and undertook to function as an independent legislative body without too much interference on the part of the Executive or too much subservience to the wishes of the Executive. That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions. There is another item that I left out, which of course is of tremendous importance, and that is the settlement of our foreign debts. I would place that as one of the major accomplishments of the last Congress. I did not make any memo, and I presume that after you are away several others will occur to me of important achievements. You have my consent to put those in, if any of you think of them.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsthepresidentsnewsconference160", "title": "Excerpts of the President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/excerpts-the-presidents-news-conference-160", "publication_date": "06-07-1926", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Calvin Coolidge"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 598, "text": "Thank you all for coming. Thank you. Please be seated. Welcome. To all you San Antonio Spurs fans, we are glad you are here in the Rose Garden. I am particularly glad the San Antonio Spurs are here today. We want to congratulate you on a fantastic championship run. I first want to welcome my friend Peter Holt, who turned out to be a pretty darn good owner. It is more than I can say for the former Ranger ownership. But congratulations, Peter, to you and your organization. I want to thank R.C. Buford, who is the general manager, and Gregg Popovich, who is the manager of-the coach of the club. And I want to welcome the players and your wives and friends and family here. After this is over, I'd like to invite you in the Oval Office and let you see where the decisions are made that affect the peace and freedom of this world. I want to welcome some huge San Antonio Spurs fans: Senator John Cornyn from San Antonio; Lamar Smith and Henry Bonilla as well from San Antonio. You got to know that during the playoffs, these guys were touting the Spurs. They were giving a pretty hefty line to anybody who dared bet against the Spurs, and you did not let them down. So welcome. I am glad you are here. Danny Ferry is here. Where is Danny Ferry? Yes, there he is. He and I share an interesting relationship. As you may know, his father, Bob, won the NBA Championship ring. And so Danny and Bob Ferry are only the second father/son combination to ever win a championship ring- -if you get my drift. We are members of the famous fathers club. And anyway, I want to welcome you here. You will see where the-only the second son of a President office is in a minute. I also-one of the things that happens when a championship team comes here, it gives me a chance to talk about the development of a culture, a winning culture inside an organization. I like to call it a culture of service, people being willing to serve something greater than themself, in this case, a team. I was struck by Tim Duncan's comments after the sixth game when they were talking about the fantastic individual effort he had. And a reporter said, What about that effort? He said, It is cool, but then immediately went on to talk about the accomplishments of his teammates, recognizing that you cannot win a championship unless you are able to rely upon others and lift others up and participate with others and work hard with others. And it is a phenomenal tribute to the San Antonio Spurs that they have got such great individual players who are willing to work as a team. And it is a wonderful example for our country-it really is. The other thing that struck me about this organization that is so powerful is that there is a culture of service when it comes to utilizing their positions as champs to make somebody else's life better. Gregg Popovich won a Point of Light for his drug-anti-drug programs in the early nineties. What a class act that must be for players to work for a coach who then takes time out of his private life to set a good example for the children of the community in which he lives and to work to rally the armies of compassion to make somebody else's life better, in this case to help a community fight off the scourge of drugs. Or David Robinson, who is now heavily involved in education in the San Antonio community. He is not only a great husband but a great role model for others to see. I know many of you all do the same thing in your communities, that you care deeply about the lives of your fellow citizens, and I want to congratulate you. I think you are champs because you understand that serving something greater than yourself is the road to championships. And that is what you are here to do, is to receive the accolades from our country for serving as not only great athletes but as great role models for children who look up to you. So welcome to the Rose Garden. Congratulations on such a great, successful season. And may God continue to bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.

{"id": 1070, "text": "You show your welcome in many delightful ways and in no more delightful way than that in which you have shown it in this room. The words which the mayor has uttered have touched me very much and I have been most touched and stimulated by the words which Senor Postorelli has so kindly uttered in behalf of the Government of this great kingdom. It is very delightful to feel my association with that government and with this city. I know how much of the vitality of Italian effort comes out of this great center of industry and of thought. As I passed through your streets I had this sensation, a sensation which I have often had in my own dear country at home-a sensation of friendship and close sympathetic contact. I could have believed myself in an American city. And I felt more than that. I felt, as I have also felt at home, that the real blood of the country flowed there in the street, in the veins of those plain people who more than some of the rest of us have borne the stress and burden of the war. Because think of the price at which you and at which we have purchased the victory which we have won. Think of the price of blood and treasure not only, but the price of tears, the price of hunger on the part of little children, the hopes delayed, the dismay of the prospects, that bore heavy upon the homes of simple people everywhere. That is the price of liberty. Those of us who plan battles, those of us who conceive policies, do not bear the burden of it. We direct and others execute. We plan and others suffer, and the conquest of spirit is greater than the conquest of arms. These are the people that hold tight. These are the people that never let go and say nothing. They merely live from day to day, determined that the glory of Italy or the glory of the United States shall not depart from her. I have been thinking as I have passed through your streets and sat here that this was the place of the labors of the great Cavour, and I have thought how impossible many of the things that have happened in Italy since, how impossible the great achievements of Italy in the last three years, would have been without the work of Cavour. Ever since I was a boy one of my treasured portraits has been a portrait of Cavour; because I had read about him, of the way in which his mind took in the nation, the national scope of it, of the strong determined patriotic endeavor that never allowed obstacles to dismay him, and of the way he always stood at the side of the King and planned the great things which the King was enabled to accomplish. And I have another thought. This is a great industrial center. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at Paris as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is one reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold. And therefore the processes of capital are in a certain sense the processes of conquest. I have only this to suggest, therefore. We go to Paris to conclude a peace. You stay here to continue it. We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations. And so it is very delightful to me to stand in this company and feel that we are not foreigners to each other. We think the same thoughts. We entertain the same purposes. We have the same ideals; and this war has done this inestimable service: It has brought nations into close vital contact, so that they feel the pulses that are in each other, so that they know the purposes by which each is animated. We know in America a great deal about Italy, because we have so many Italian fellow citizens. When Baron Soninno was arguing the other day for the extension of the sovereignty of Italy over Italian populations, I said, I am sorry we can not let you have New York, which, I understand, is the greatest Italian city in the world. I am told that there are more Italians in New York City than in any city in Italy, and I am proud to be ENTITY of a Nation which contains so large an element of the Italian race, because, as a student of literature, I know the genius that has originated in this great nation, the genius of thought and of poetry and of philosophy and of music, and I am happy to be a part of a Nation which is enriched and made better by the introduction of such elements of genius and of inspiration. May I not again thank the representative of this great city and the representative of the Government for the welcome they have given me, and say again, for I can not say it too often, Viva l'ltalia?", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthephilharmonicclubturinitaly", "title": "Remarks at The Philharmonic Club in Turin, Italy", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-philharmonic-club-turin-italy", "publication_date": "06-01-1919", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 599, "text": "Well, thank you very much for that warm welcome. I am pleased to be back at the FBI to unveil a new line of attack on our war against terrorism, the Most Wanted Terrorist list. Terrorists try to operate in the shadows. They try to hide, but we are going to shine the light of justice on them. We list their names; we publicize their pictures; we rob them of their secrecy. Terrorism has a face, and today we expose it for the world to see. Mr. General, thank you very much for your leadership, your strong resolve, the values you espouse. I want to thank all the Justice Department folks who are here today. I am so honored to be up here with the Secretary of State. He is doing a fabulous job of rallying the world to our cause. And I want to thank the State Department officials who are here today, as well. And of course, Director Mueller, I want to thank you and the fine men and women of the FBI for your diligent efforts to disrupt and find anybody who tries to harm Americans. I also want to introduce Tom Ridge, the Director of the Office of Homeland Security. Thank you for being here, Governor, as well as General Wayne Downing, the Deputy National Security Adviser for Combating Terrorism. Thank you all for coming. The men on the wall here have put themselves on the list because of great acts of evil. They plan, promote, and commit murder. They fill the minds of others with hate and lies. And by their cruelty and violence, they betray whatever faith they espouse. These 22 individuals do not account for all the terrorist activity in the world, but they are among the most dangerous, the leaders and key supporters, the planners and strategists. They must be found. They will be stopped, and they will be punished. This effort is part of a worldwide assault on terror. All our allies and friends will now be familiar with these evildoers and their associates. For those who join our coalition, we expect results. And a good place to start-help us bring these folks to justice. Eventually, no corner of the world will be dark enough to hide in. I want to thank all the State Department employees for helping to build an unprecedented-I mean unprecedented-coalition to stand with us for freedom. I want to thank the American people for understanding that we are engaged in a new war, a war that will require a new way of thinking. There is a fascination about the conventional aspects of the military operations that are taking place now, and I can understand that. But the American people must understand that we are making great progress in other fronts, that we are halting their money, that we have got allies around the world helping us close the net. And today, by shining the spotlight on the first 22, it is going to make it more likely they will be brought to justice. I say the first 22 because our war is not just against 22 individuals. Our war is against networks and groups, people who coddle them, people who try to hide them, people who fund them. This is our calling. This is the calling of the United States of America, the most free nation in the world, a nation built on fundamental values, that rejects hate, rejects violence, rejects murderers, rejects evil. And we will not tire. We will not relent. It is not only important for the homeland security of America that we succeed; it is equally as important for generations of Americans who have yet be born. Now is the time to draw the line in the sand against the evil ones. And this Government is committed to doing just that. I also want to remind my fellow Americans, as we round up the evildoers, as we look for those who might harm our fellow Americans, we must remember not to violate the rights of the innocent. Our war is not against a religion. Our war is against evil. There are thousands of Muslim Americans who love America just as much as I do. And we will respect their rights. We will not let the terrorists cause decay of the fundamental rights that make our Nation unique. As a matter of fact, what they will find out is that our Nation has responded in a way they never envisioned. We are united. People of all faiths, all religions, all areas of our country are united in the common effort to stamp out evil where we find it. It is the right thing to do. It is the right course of action for our Nation and the world, and I want to thank you all for helping.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingthemostwantedterroristslist", "title": "Remarks Announcing the Most Wanted Terrorists List", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-the-most-wanted-terrorists-list", "publication_date": "10-10-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 765, "text": "What a moment of hope it was 1 year ago when Central American leaders concluded their meeting in Guatemala. The Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, a Communist regime fighting a civil war against 15,000 Nicaraguan freedom fighters opposed to their oppression, agreed to a series of sweeping democratic reforms. If carried out, those reforms would have ended the killing and brought peace to Nicaragua and Central America. It would also have meant that Nicaragua would at last join the family of free, democratic nations. At first, there were a few hopeful signs. To much media fanfare, the opposition newspaper in Nicaragua, La Prensa, was reopened. Independent radio stations were allowed to broadcast again. A few political prisoners were released, and political groups were allowed more latitude. Most important, Sandinistas finally agreed to the freedom fighters' request for direct negotiations for a peaceful, democratic settlement. Now the main reason the Sandinistas agreed to those steps a year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters, including important battlefield victories like the one at Los Minas. But tragically, at the very moment when continued strength and determination by the United States might have meant the continued success of the peace plan, the United States House of Representatives decided, and by only a very narrow margin, to refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters. This, of course, removed the principal prod-the military victories and popular success of the freedom fighters-to Sandinista participation in the peace plan and sent an immediate signal of American weakness to the Communists. This failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and sad consequences-just how costly and sad we have seen during the past few weeks. Communist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega has been visiting Castro in Cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who has brought so much sadness and misery to that country; while in Nicaragua, a renewed attack on political dissent is being led by the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated Communist and grim, hardened repressor of human rights whose office, according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also been actively engaged in the international drug trade. Acting under the orders of the Communist leaders and Borge's supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans. Opposition leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison. Political, religious liberties have again been curtailed. The Communists ordered the Catholic archbishop to shut down the Catholic radio station, and for almost 2 weeks the independent newspaper, La Prensa, was refused permission to publish. And the American ambassador was expelled. And yet, while the cutoff of aid to the freedom fighters was a dreadful mistake, getting the cause of peace and freedom back on track-not recrimination-must now be our goal. There is a chance for real bipartisan consensus in support of renewed contra aid. Indeed, one of its strong supporters has recently been named to be the Vice Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party. Senator Bob Dole intends soon to offer legislation to renew effective assistance to the freedom fighters. The final details are being worked out. And I urge the Members of the Senate to support the aid package, and I also ask the House of Representatives to move speedily and favorably on the Senate legislation. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue aggressively our diplomatic efforts with the Central American democracies. So much is at stake. A few years ago, there were those who said the cause of freedom and democracy was lost in El Salvador. Well, perhaps some of you remember that incredible scene when the people of that country defied Communist threats and bullets to march to the polls and vote for democracy. The American aid package that helped make democracy victorious in El Salvador passed by only two votes in the House-but pass it did, and democracy did come. A few weeks ago, both Vice President Bush and I visited the bedside of one of the heroes of that struggle, President Duarte of El Salvador. President Duarte has had no easy life. He has been continually threatened by extremists of both left and right. His daughter was kidnapped by Communist guerrillas. And now, while in a desperate struggle with cancer, he continues to lead his nation on the high road to democracy. I cannot tell you how deeply moved Vice President Bush and I were by our visit to this brave and remarkable man and how determined we both were that his dream for his people and all the peoples of Central America should be made a reality-the dream of peace and freedom for every man, woman, and child. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationaidthenicaraguandemocraticresistance", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on Aid to the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-aid-the-nicaraguan-democratic-resistance", "publication_date": "30-07-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 575, "text": "It is more than 100 years since Abraham Lincoln charged the living to dedicate themselves to the unfinished work of the dead at Gettysburg. Even Lincoln, with his deep sense of man's imperfections, could not know that a century later we would still be striving to abolish racial injustice. No task is more deeply rooted in the complexities of American life. Poverty and tradition, fear and ignorance, the structure of our society and the workings of our economy, all converge on this enormous wrong which has troubled the American conscience from the beginning. Its just solution is essential, not only to give the full blessings of freedom to Negroes, but to liberate all of us. There are those who say: It has taken us a century to move this far. It will take another hundred years to finish the job. Well, I am here to say to you tonight that I do not agree. Great social change tends to come rapidly in periods of intense activity and progress before the impulse slows. I believe we are in the midst of such a period of change. So, it is our task to carry forward nothing less than the full assimilation of more than 20 million Negroes into American life. This is not to be an assimilation of bland conformity. Our object is not to make all people alike. It is, as it has always been, to allow ready access to every blessing of liberty, while permitting each to keep his sense of identity with a culture and tradition. In this way we enlarge our freedom and we enrich our Nation. We have just passed a milestone in this task. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 extends the protection of the law to many of the demands of justice. This act, of course, is not the whole answer. But tonight I ask each of you to think for a moment what an enormous setback the failure to pass it would have been. When I picked up after our beloved leader had been taken from us, I did not know and few in my vicinity knew that we would ever get as far as we have. Now, your Government must and will move rapidly to carry out this legislation. I have come here tonight to tell you and I expect you to tell those that you counsel with and those you lead that we intend to give new vigor to our many activities in the field of equal opportunity. The Congress, in title VI of the Civil Rights Act, established the principle that race or color can be no criteria for participation in Federal programs. Last week I approved the first set of regulations to implement that principle. Those regulations are designed to provide a just and prompt and reasoned resolution of all disputes. Our first objective will always be to assure nondiscriminatory operation rather than to put an end to programs which are vital to the welfare of all Americans. The widespread voluntary support, in all parts of the country, of the public accommodation title is proof of the educational value of law, and the great reservoir of good will among Americans. I believe this title, too, will find wide acceptance. It is simple justice that all should share in programs that are financed by all and that are directed by the Government of all the people. Within your Government there are many programs dedicated to the goal of equal opportunity. They range from the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, the Civil Rights Commission and the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing to the Community Relations Service, the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Employment, and the soon to be created Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Each of these groups has a distinct and a very important mission. Those now in existence have done a difficult task in an impressive way. But really they all aim toward the same general objective. And really they must pursue that objective through cooperation among themselves and with private groups such as the distinguished members of this organization who have helped us so much for so long. With so many groups in a single field, there is always the danger of duplication, overlap, or unnecessary delay. As long as I am your President, I want the Government of all of the people to speak with a single voice on this single question. Therefore, I am delighted to tell you tonight that I have asked Vice President-elect Hubert Humphrey, and he has agreed, to assume the responsibility for working with all of these groups, assisting in coordination of their efforts, and helping them to build toward an energetic pursuit of equal opportunity for all people in this Nation. These are some of the steps that we are taking, and there are going to be a good many more. For, as the problem of civil rights has grown in urgency, it has also grown in complexity. We must open the doors of opportunity. We must equip our people to walk through those doors. Thus, programs to eliminate poverty, to improve education, to provide housing by enlarging the opportunities of all Americans assure new opportunities for Negro Americans. There are those who predict that the struggle for full equality in America will be marked by violence and hate; that it will tear at the fabric of our society. Well, for myself, I cannot claim to see so clearly into that future. I just do not agree. I know that racial feelings flow from many deep and resistant sources in our history, in the pattern of our lives, and in the nature of man. But I believe there are other forces that are stronger because they are armed with truth which will bring us toward our goal in peace. These are our commitments to morality and to justice which are written in our laws and, more importantly, nourished in the hearts of our people. These commitments carried forward by men of good will in every part of this land will lead this Nation toward the great and necessary fulfillment of American freedom. In this way our peoples will once again prove equal to the ideals and the values on which this our beloved Nation rests. This has been a long and somewhat exacting week. We have met and heard the problems of the Prime Minister of Malawi. We have met and visited at some length with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United Kingdom. We have met and discussed the problems of free men in southeast Asia. We have reviewed the lot of the people on the continent of Africa, and particularly the Congo. But in each and every one of these studies, we have tried to put the interest of the individual and the dignity of the person first and foremost in our minds. In a doubtful period in 1957, 85 years since the Congress acted on the subject of civil rights and protecting the constitutional rights of all of our people, I sat down with the leaders of the Urban League, and with their guidance and with their help and with their support, for the first time in 85 years, we passed the first Civil Rights Act through the Congress of the United States. That was a small step forward. We were just learning to walk, but by 1960 it was possible for us to implement that statute and to contribute some constructive improvements. Then, a new administration came to power in 1961 and at the end of 4 years we had passed the most comprehensive legislation-and signed it--ever to be put on our statute books in this field. Now, the lights are still on in the White House tonight--preparing programs that will keep our country up with the times, and it will keep our feet on the ground. We have a Great Society. We do not have to begin one; we just have to keep it, retain it, improve it, and develop it. We know that the education of our citizens, the employment of our people, the health of their bodies, the freedom they enjoy, the security that is theirs are all uppermost in the minds of those charged with the responsibility of leadership. I would not be human if I did not say that under your leadership and the leadership of other conscious, concerned people in this country, you have placed upon me a terrifying responsibility and an obligation that it will be my determination to deserve every waking moment of my term of office. Your faith in the future of your land and the future of the leadership that has been chosen has already been expressed, but I wanted at the end of a long day to come here and tell you of my faith in you. There are many things I want for my people and a few things I want for my little girls. I am going to do what I can in the time allotted me to help bring those about. One of the Presidents that I admire most signed the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years ago. But emancipation was a proclamation and was not a fact. It shall be my purpose and it is my duty to make it a fact. Until every qualified person regardless of the house where he worships or the State where he resides or the way he spells his name or the color of his skin--until he has the right unquestioned and unrestrained to go in and cast his ballot in every precinct in this country, I am not going to be satisfied. The finest compliment that I can pay to the Negroes of America is to say that if their constitutional rights are protected as mine are protected, if they have the privilege of voting as I am privileged to vote, then all these other problems will take care of themselves. Now, I want to say one word before I leave. I must be careful not to be commercial. But you people have been trusting me for a long, long time. A good many of you have been among my closest friends since I came here in 1937. There is just one thing I want to say to you. I want to thank each and every one of you who has spent an hour or a dollar with the Urban League, because it is through efforts that you have made and others like you that the shackles of bondage have been removed from your fellow man. There are men who are dying tonight in Viet-Nam to preserve the freedom of us all, and the least that you can do, until you are called upon to give your life, is to give your support, give your talent, and give your heart to organizations like this and to leadership of men like Whitney Young.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalurbanleaguescommunityactionassembly", "title": "Remarks at the National Urban League's Community Action Assembly", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-urban-leagues-community-action-assembly", "publication_date": "10-12-1964", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

{"id": 763, "text": "Thank you so much. This is a very enjoyable evening. And it is very thoughtful, to say nothing about how generous it is of you to bring us all together for this most pleasant evening. You know I have been watching the polls pretty closely here of late. And as you might imagine, I like some of them quite a lot more than I like others. The ones I like best are those that like me best. But in this era in which we are living, I was not too sure of their credibility--so the other day I just went out and had a poll of my own made. You may be interested. The question went this way: If President Johnson were to run against the following nationally known Republican leaders, who would you vote for? The first pairing showed: Lyndon B. Johnson--73 percent. William E. Miller--27 percent. Then we added another picture that would involve the entire ticket. The second pairing dealt with the ticket of both President and Vice President. Once again I am happy to report that I think we did very well under the circumstances. Lyndon Johnson and Hubert H. Humphrey--71 percent. Harold E. Stassen and Ezra Taft Benson--29 percent. I think I should tell you that we circulated our poll among leading editors throughout the country--and other experts. The response seemed to be very good. One telegram I remember came in from a very important national magazine. It said: Congratulations, Mr. President, on a very fine and well conducted poll. It was signed, Editor, Literary Digest. A President, of course, sees a great many expressions of public opinion. The other day someone handed me this evaluation of the state of the world: The earth is degenerating these days. Bribery and corruption abound. Children no longer mind parents. Every man wants to write a book and it is evident that the end of the world is approaching fast. I wondered who the columnist was. Later I discovered that, whoever he was, he wrote what he had to say on an Assyrian tablet almost 5,000 years ago. You do not have to look far to see the same kind of thing today--much of it is directed at the man in the kitchen that President Harry Truman talked about. --Some people think we are spending too much, and some think we are not spending enough. --Some people think we should not raise taxes, and some think we should have raised them last year. --Some think that we are not doing enough for the people in need, and some think we have done too much already. --Some think we should escalate the war in Vietnam, and some think we should get out of there tomorrow. There is no lack of advice--however contradictory. In the crisis of this hour--as in all others that we have faced since our Nation began--there are plenty of recommendations on how to get out of trouble cheaply and fast. Most of them in the last analysis really come down to this: Deny your responsibilities. In world affairs, behave as if you were a small nation with few interests; behave as if the oceans were twice as wide as they really are; behave as if you do not care what happens to people with different tongues or different cultures, or colors of skin--so long as they are not shooting at your house--just now. Here at home, behave as if every baby is born with the same chance to succeed in life--although his crib may lie in the squalid back room of a slum. Behave as if rats were funny--too funny to fight with Federal help. Behave as if health and education and jobs were somebody else's concern--not yours. Behave as if the farmer is getting as much as he deserves. Behave as if you have no interest in helping local authorities protect their communities from crime and violence. Behave as if runaway inflation is inevitable-above all, never send up a tax bill designed to fight inflation. I hear and read a good deal of this kind of advice. It is much more subtle than I have described it tonight, more reasonable. It is the voice not of the dove or the hawk, but of the ostrich. Be certain of this--in the time that I have been given to lead this country, I shah not follow that kind of advice. The Democratic Party has never chosen the road of irresponsibility. In the 1960's, America, under Democratic leadership, has faced up to the poverty and discrimination in its midst. It has not yet mastered them. But it has started--started on the road toward mastery--toward healing and educating and training and employing those whom life was passing by. This party, and the programs it has inspired and legislated and turned into action, has set a standard in the 1960's by which every administration that follows must be judged. For it was we who said: --poverty must be abolished, --a good education must be the birthright of every child, --our cities must be made fit for a free people, --the environment must be cleansed and protected for every family, --our streets must be made safe for law-abiding citizens, and --basic human rights must be made real for every man and woman among us. Let them say that we have aroused expectations. So have all of those who have liberated men from dreamless sleep and sullen apathy--and set them on the way to becoming what their Creator intended them to be. Let them say that we have not accomplished our goals entirely--that there is still ignorance and misery and despair in our cities and in our rural towns. Yes, there is-and there always will be, unless America completes the work we have already begun in these 7 years. My friends, next year will be a testing time for America. The question our people are going to have to answer is dear: --Shall we go on building? --Or shall we become discouraged with ourselves, impatient that the work is not yet finished? Shall we bury all that we have begun--begun with such hope and promise--and bury it in a shroud of inaction and reaction? You here tonight have come a long way to give your answer. Every State in the Union is represented in this hall tonight. You are making it possible for the party that believes in building to take its case to the people--to tell them what we promised to do on that August evening in 1964 at Atlantic City we have done--and that America is a richer and a stronger and a fairer Nation today because Democrats made it so. And we have only begun. Our party and our country is greater than any of us. It is entitled to the best from all of us. As for myself, my first and last business is trying to win and trying to secure the peace. That task will take all that I have--and I shall give it gladly. So tonight I tell you that I will work as hard as any man can work for his country, and I will do everything in my power to build a record for our Democratic Party that America will enthusiastically embrace 13 months from now. I regret that I cannot predict, this evening, when the issue that most concerns us will be resolved. I do know that we are following the road of responsibility in Vietnam, as we are here at home. I know--I know probably as well as any man, save those who are fighting for us out there tonight, at this very hour--that it is a rough road to travel. But the road, I think, does lead to a free Asia--and the road does lead, I think, to a freer and a happier and a more secure United States. I believe the American people will follow its course--not blithely, not cheerfully--for they all lament the waste of war; but they will follow it with a firm determination, now that we have begun it, to see it through all the way. A very brave man, reflecting on the years that lay ahead for his country, back in 1960, had this to say: Now the age of consolidation is over and once again the age of change and challenge has come upon us. The result, John Fitzgerald Kennedy said, is that: The next year, the next decade, in all likelihood the next generation, will require more bravery and wisdom on our part than any period in our history. We will be face to face, every day, in every part of our lives and times, with the real issue of our age--the issue of survival. And so we are. I live with that knowledge. I live every day with the responsibilities it entails--with those our country bears, because it is the strongest and it is the freest of all nations--and also with those that I bear, because of the office I hold. If I may, let me speak quite personally to you for a moment. I have--as you know--spent my entire life in the political arena. I treasure the support of our people. I treasure that support as much, I think, as any man could. And I know, as you must know, that there are many who suggest ways to increase that support--temporarily: --by softening or renouncing the struggle in Vietnam, or escalating it to the red line of danger, --by giving in and retreating on the tax proposal, --by abandoning the fight against discrimination--the fight for the poor-- here at home. Some may say there is short term political gain for me, and for our party, if we could follow this kind of a course. But what about a year from now? What about 5 years from now? What would choosing that course mean--not just for Lyndon Johnson, and not just for the Democratic Party, but for the glorious United States of America? It would mean, in my opinion, greatly increasing the chances of a major war--not this year, but in the years immediately ahead. It would mean imposing a far more onerous tax, a tax of inflation, on all of our people--and the poorest among us--not just this year, but next year. It would mean dooming our cities to angry strife and squalor--in every year yet to come. So we do have a choice. We can take the easy road tonight, denying our responsibilities, hoping that a rise in our polls will compensate for what we ought to have done for our country. Or we can take the harder road of responsibility. We can do what we believe is right for our children's future, though it may mean a great deal of present pain. Well, I have made my choice. And I pray that I--and we--will have enough of that bravery, unselfishness, and wisdom that Jack Kennedy said we would need--to see it through, all the way. Just an additional minute. I will not be long. You have been here too long, I am sure, already. This is not in the text, I do want to say it while I have the chance. This party tonight, this salute, should have been given to the man who really deserves it. The next one that the Democratic Committee gives is going to be for the man who deserves it more than any Vice President who ever served this Nation--Hubert Humphrey. And to those great Governors of great Democratic States, those outstanding mayors from Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and throughout the country, who have come a long way to be here tonight to give us their support and their inspiration, to those of you who have made sacrifices from your family and your own luxury to come here and make it possible for your country to get the truth message, I want to tell you that we are so grateful. It gives us such encouragement and strength to know that all of you in this room, and in the other room, would want to do what you have done. To the National Committee, the chairman and vice chairman, Mr. Bailey and Mrs. Price, to Mr. Criswell, who has done a remarkable job, I want to say thank you very much. This is not a group of big men, rich men. This is not a group of little men and poor men. This is not a group from the eastern seaboard or the west coast. This group comes from every State in the Union--more from New York, Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, some of the larger States, than from the smaller ones. But every State has sent someone here tonight. The person who is most responsible for that, and the person who is most responsible for ridding us of all the troubles and heartaches that come from trying to meet leftover bills, is a quiet, silent, humble man from New York named Arthur Krim, who the people who believe in the Democratic Party owe as much to as any man who ever served the Democratic Party.

{"id": 1045, "text": "Thank you very much, Secretary Perry, Admiral Miller, Admiral Owens, Admiral Flanagan, Admiral Murphy, Captain Gemmill, and to all of you who are here. It is a great honor for me to be here. I asked to see the person responsible for decorating the F-14 with my name and the Vice President's name there. I guess I am going to have to take flying lessons. Audience member. He is right here, Mr. ENTITY, Skipper Al Myers. Comdr. Alan Myers. Al Myers, sir. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I told someone to take a picture of that, and I am going to take it back to the Vice President when I see him this afternoon and suggest that we both take flying lessons. Admiral Miller said, You understand on that plane, you would still control the eject seat. And I told him, I do not believe in ejecting. I'd never bail out. But I was glad to know that. I thank you all for your service. I am pleased and honored to be with you today. I understand that some of you have actually chosen to come back from your leave to be a part of this ceremony, and I am deeply grateful for yet another expression of your devotion to your country. I am proud of the job you have done, proud of the great work that all of our troops are doing in Haiti. And on behalf of the American people, the most important message I have to you today is a simple, straightforward, heartfelt thank you. I also want to thank, especially, Captain Gemmill and the crew of this magnificent carrier for the I Like Ike button. You know, you may think that is funny, since he was a Republican and I am a Democrat, but when I was born, ENTITY Truman was President. But obviously, I was an infant; I did not have much consciousness of it. President Eisenhower was elected in the year I went to the first grade, so he was the first President I really ever knew anything about. And all of us, regardless of our party, liked Ike. I can still remember when the country was united in a way that it is not now and when political arguments were a little more civil than they tend to be now. President Eisenhower's life of service to our country and his incredible leadership throughout his military career, culminating in his leadership in World War II and of course ultimately in his election to the Presidency, was an inspiration to me and to every other young American and I know is a continuing inspiration to all of you who are privileged to serve on this great carrier and in this group. Much has been asked of you, and you have delivered. Thanks to your efforts, the Haitian people are moving from fear to freedom. Thanks to your efforts, the democratically elected government will soon return to power. Thanks to your efforts, the world knows that the United States will stand up for human rights and against slaughter, stand up for democracy, honor our commitments, and expect those who make commitments to us to honor them as well. We gave our word, and you, the men and women of the Eisenhower Battle Group, kept the word of the United States. And for that, we are all in your debt. The stories from Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti have inspired all Americans. We have seen the moving images of Haitians approaching and thanking American troops for their new-found freedom. We have seen the joy in their eyes and the hope in their faces. Operation Uphold Democracy is not over yet, and you know well that it still presents dangers to the men and women of our Armed Forces. But look what has happened in less than 3 weeks. In less than 3 weeks, you have disarmed FRAPH, the attaches, and the other militia who terrorized thousands of Haitians. In less than 3 weeks, you took heavy weapons away from the military and made the cities and the towns more secure. In less than 3 weeks, you helped 1,900 refugees return home from Guantanamo, no longer afraid for their lives. In less than 3 weeks, you permitted Parliament once again to open its doors for business. And today, they are having a good, old-fashioned debate down there, about like what happens in Congress every day in Washington. In less than 3 weeks, you returned Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul, a man in hiding in his own country for 3 years, back to his office. In less than 3 weeks, you put state radio and television back into the hands of people who want democracy. In less than 3 weeks, you even turned the lights back on in Cap Haitien after 2 years of darkness. In less than 3 weeks, you showed the world what the men and women of the American military can do. All of us owe these achievements to the fact that you are the best trained, best prepared, best equipped, most highly motivated fighting force in the world. Your reputation preceded you to Haiti. When the military rulers learned that you were on your way, they agreed to step down. The awesome force you represent is the steel in the sword of America's diplomacy. The success of the mission in Haiti to date also shows how flexible our military has become. Thanks to careful planning by the U.S. Atlantic Command and the joint task force, we were able to quickly recall the massive assault force that was on its way. In its place, and within just hours of reaching agreement with Mr. Cedras and the other military leaders, we sent in troops, carried by the Eisenhower Battle Group, to keep the peace in Haiti. Operation Uphold Democracy demonstrates the value of mixing our four services together and drawing on the special capabilities of each of them, what Admiral Miller calls adaptive force packaging. You prepared the first-ever infantry air assault from a carrier. Had it not been for such innovation, it would have taken many more hours, if not days, for our troops to be on the ground there. I salute Admiral Miller and the members of his staff who developed this innovative plan, which will change our military planning and make it possible for us to do remarkable things well into the 21st century. You have laid the groundwork for a dramatic forward movement in a military planning and execution. You should be proud, and the Nation owes Admiral Miller and his staff a great deal. Of course, even the best strategists can only make a difference if they have the resources to do the job. That is why I was pleased yesterday to sign the fiscal year '95 defense authorization bill, which was passed with strong bipartisan support including the support of Virginia's two fine Senators, Chuck Robb and John Warner, and the two able Congressmen from this area, Norm Sisisky and Bobby Scott. This bill will assure that you remain better trained, better equipped, and better prepared than any other military in the world, and I am determined that it will always be that way. Thank you. I know that one piece of this defense bill will be especially welcome news for all of you, the $3.6 billion we will spend on a new aircraft carrier, CVN-76. That carrier will be built right here in Norfolk by thousands of hard-working Virginians. Like the Eisenhower, it will give us the capability to project our power around the world, to support peacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions, and, if necessary, to fight and to win regional conflicts. In 2 weeks, just 2 weeks, you set sail for the Adriatic, to carry on your work of protecting our country's national interests around the world. I know you will demonstrate the same skill and professionalism on this journey that you have shown in Haiti. In a few moments, I will have the distinct honor of presenting Navy commendation medals for meritorious service in Haiti to several of you. But I want every one of you to know that in my book, each and every one of you is a medal winner, an example of what is the very best in our country. You serve with distinction, you serve in a selfless way, you serve in a way that will help us to build a peaceful and freer and stronger world for yourselves and your children as we move into the next century, and we are all in your debt. Men and women of the Ike, you have proved your capabilities time and again. In Haiti, you brought a new day to a people who thought they would never get it. You answered the call; you did the job; your country is proud of you. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksaboardtheusseisenhowernorfolkvirginia", "title": "Remarks Aboard the U.S.S.

{"id": 1029, "text": "Well, and already I have met someone from my hometown, Dixon, Illinois. Thank all of you. It is wonderful to have you visit here in the Rose Garden, where you can still see a little of the summer's crop is left. I have been very interested in the Future Farmers of America, your program of building our American communities. And I commend all of you individually for your wonderful work in helping our rural communities. It is gratifying to me to see young people like yourselves volunteering your time to keep these communities strong. And everything you have done, including Care and Share and working with local churches and various groups and other private sector initiatives, is indispensable to the future of our farm communities. I want you to know that I have been thinking about the problems of the farm these past few years. In fact, we are , all of us here in this big house, constantly concerned about the challenges faced by American farmers during these difficult days. We are a farming nation. We always have been. The American farmer not only feeds this country that is 238 million strong, the American farmer feeds the world. And so when we contemplate the problems farmers are facing these days, we realize that we are dealing with a problem that speaks to the heart of how America lives and what America is. A while back I received a letter from a daughter of a farmer in Louisiana. She wrote of how she remembered her father-up at last light, no time for breakfast, out milking the cows, gathering eggs, feeding the dogs. She spoke of how always in a farmer's day something will break down, and her father would have to fix it. And then he would hit the fields with the tractor and the earth tiller, and he would not mind because a farmer is part of the ground he works. But she ended it with these words addressed to all: Do not you think it is time to say thanks to the farmer? After all, you stick your feet under his table every day. Well, those are wonderful words, and they shine with truth. But we do thank the farmer. And when you go home, will you tell your parents how we feel? We have been trying to encourage a national farm bill that will help the farmer and ensure that you have a future in farming by making American agriculture more competitive. We want to put the agriculture industry on a firm and sound basis once and for all so that by the time you are ready to own and work a farm, you can count on being part of a strong and vibrant industry. And my great hope for you, for those of you who do aspire to farm for a living, is that you will be as wonderful as your parents are those people who are feeding a great nation and the world. They are the mainstay, the backbone of a great country. And I have got a little special place in my heart that is devoted to them alone. It is been wonderful to have you here, and I thank you all for coming. I'd like to just add something here. You know, about 135 years ago a Frenchman came to this country because this country had already become the great economic powerhouse that it has continued to be. His name was Alexis de Tocqueville, and he toured all over this country, as he said, looking for the secret of our greatness. And he told some wonderful things. We are pretty unique in all the world with things like you, yourselves, are doing volunteer programs where people set out to help others, to help their neighbors. It is pretty traditionally American. And he described it as how, he said, a man would see a problem, and he would not call the Government. He'd cross the street and talk to a friend, and pretty soon a committee would be formed. And, he said, they would solve the problem. And then in his book to his own countrymen in France, he said, and you will not believe this, but there would not be a bureaucracy involved at any time in solving that problem. But he found the secret of America, and he also put this in his book. He said he had looked in the busy harbors; he'd looked in our industrial cities; he'd looked all over for the secret of our greatness. And then he said he looked in our churches, and he heard our pulpits aflame with righteousness. And he said America is great because America is good. And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. Well, I have taken more than my time here because I have got to get in Marine One out there on the South Lawn in just a few minutes and head off for New Hampshire with some of our people and talk to the people up there. And you are all invited to go on over there and you girls, it will kind of blow your hairdos a little bit when we take off. We will shortly be taking off in Marine One, as it is called, out to get on Air Force One. So, again, thank you all for being here. God bless all of you. Mr. Meredith. Mr. President, you have long been recognized as having a tremendous desire to serve both education and agriculture, a desire reflected by the appointment of Secretaries Bennett and Block to serve this nation. As young people preparing for careers in the agriculture industry, and as part of a vocational education program in agriculture, we are excited about our futures. In particular, we are pleased to have you as a part of this national FFA conference on community development and would like to present you with this special gift from the Future Farmers of America and R.J. Reynolds Industries, Incorporated, and invite you to attend the 58th National FFA Convention, with over 22,000 members in attendance, November 14 through the 16th, in Kansas City, Missouri. Thank you. Well, thank you all very much. I am very proud and pleased to have this. I have to tell you that there have been times when I hear a ticking I worry a little bit. In this case I figure it must be all right. But thank you all very much, and this will see that I get on the helicopter on time, as well as everyplace else. Thank you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswhitehousereceptionformembersthefuturefarmersamerica", "title": "Remarks at a White House Reception for Members of the Future Farmers of America", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-white-house-reception-for-members-the-future-farmers-america", "publication_date": "18-09-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 659, "text": "Governor Reagan, Congressman Pettis, Congressman Veysey, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Veterans Administrator, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and all of the distinguished guests in this very great audience: I have had a rare privilege in the past 3 days, one that comes to a President of the United States on occasions when he can leave Washington and get out into the country. In those 3 days I have visited New York City and then on to Illinois, at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, and then Idaho Falls in Idaho, the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, Dallas for the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and finally, today, Loma Linda, California. I can only say that after seeing this great country of ours, and hundreds of thousands of people, it is really good to be home in California, here at Loma Linda. I know that represented in this audience are a number of Californians, and a number from all parts of the country, because one of the greatnesses of California is that we come from all the States of the Nation and from most of the nations of the world. On this occasion, I would like to direct my remarks to the double purpose of the announcement that we are making today. The first is with regard to the hospital that Governor Reagan referred to that was destroyed in the earthquake of February 9. That was a hospital located in one of the most beautiful areas of southern California, on the tip of the San Fernando Valley. It no longer, of course, can be used, and it should not be rebuilt. Consequently, we are replacing it here, but not only replacing it, but making a bigger hospital and a better hospital than we had before, right here in Loma Linda. Now, the question comes: What do we do with the land that we had? Here we have a policy which, in our Administration, we are implementing on a broad scale across the country. The Federal Government, for example, owns 45 percent of all the land in the State of California. We own land all over this country that the Federal Government does not need, land that could be better used by the States, by the counties, by the people of this country. So, under these circumstances, with regard to the 94 acres in the San Fernando Valley, we are declaring it surplus through the cooperation of the Veterans Administration, so that it can be made into a park, a park which will be available to the people in that area and all the people of southern California. Let me tell you why that kind of park is important. When I was out there--and this was my first visit to Jackson Hole, the Grand Teton National Park--and saw the magnificence of that park, I talked to hundreds of people from all over the country. Oh, there were some people from Bergen County, New Jersey, and others from Minnesota. There was a Scout group from Wisconsin. There were a number of people from California. I found from the Director of the Parks that hundreds of thousands, and sometimes even millions, go to those parks through a year. But I also know, and you know, that while millions of Americans are fortunate enough to be able to afford the time and the money to go to one of those great parks located mostly in the western part of the United States, the great majority of Americans, and particularly of American young people, never see one. They live in the cities. This is their home, and what we must do is to bring the parks to the people. That is what we are doing through this program. Governor, we know that whether it is the beach at San Clemente, which we declared surplus so that we can have a wonderful surfing beach down there that now can be used, or whether it is this 94 acres, that you, in cooperation with the city and county, will make good use of this land for the people of the State of California as they want it to be used. Now, let me turn to this great hospital, and to say something about it and those who administer it that I think needs to be recognized, and particularly should be recognized by ENTITY. Reference was made by the Mayor 1 in his remarks that in 1953 he got an autograph from me. At that time I had just become Vice President of the United States. And that same year, 1953, 18 years ago, I really learned what the people who have built Loma Linda University, what the Seventh Day Adventists, do, not only in America, because I visited Loma Linda University--it was then Loma Linda College, as I recall, in 1950--but I learned what they are doing in the world, because in that year, 1953, Mrs. Nixon and I took a trip clear around the world. 1 Douglas F. Welebir was mayor of Loma Linda. As we visited the countries of Southeast Asia and Southern Asia, we saw several hospitals run by various organizations. The most impressive ones were the ones run by the Seventh Day Adventists, people who were dedicated. There were doctors, there were nurses, there were others who were giving their lives for the purpose of helping those people in those poor countries develop a better system of medicine. As I think of the desire all of us have to have a world of peace in which people of the world can work together and live together, rather than to fight each other, I think of nothing that does more to make friends for America abroad than that kind of selfless service by people like those from Loma Linda who have gone out through the world, as they have gone out. Now a word as to what this hospital will mean. First, to the veterans it means better care, because this will be a great hospital, I can assure you. A hospital is not just a magnificent building like this splendid building, but what really counts in a hospital is the dedication of the doctors and the nurses and the others. And I can assure you this hospital will have the most dedicated doctors, nurses, and personnel we can possibly find, and our veterans will benefit from that. The second thing I think is important to note is that all the community, all the Nation will benefit, because as Don Johnson, our Veterans Administrator, has often pointed out, and as he was telling me coming out on the plane from Dallas the other day, the work that is done in veterans hospitals makes breakthroughs that benefit all the country. For example, the treatment of so-called tropical diseases breakthroughs have been made already as a result of the work that has been done in the very difficult war in which we are presently engaged that we did not think was possible even in World War II, and more will come. So we see this hospital benefiting, as it should, first the veterans and providing better care for them, but beyond that, providing a basis for training for doctors, nurses, and others, and the basis for research which will improve the health of all the country; and then beyond that, as I have indicated, contributing to better health for all the people of the world. So I am sure you can understand why all of us at this very moment, as we make this announcement, can realize that this is an announcement that everybody can support. Without regard to party, we are all for good health. Without regard to party, we are all for better relations between nations. Without regard to party, thinking as Americans, we want to do everything that we can to help those veterans who have served our country, who have made sacrifices that we did not make ourselves. And without regard to party, we are proud to participate in an event which we know is going to build America rather than tear it down, and that is what this event is doing. In that spirit, could I add just a word to the very eloquent remarks of Governor Reagan? As one travels across this country, he thinks of numbers of things. But one impression that indelibly is made, as far as I am concerned, is this: As you go from New York to Illinois, to Idaho, to Wyoming, to Texas, and then out to California, you realize this is a very big country. You realize it is a very diverse country. But also, despite what may be said and heard at tunes running America down, you realize America is a beautiful country. You also realize that the American people are a good people. They are a people who have gone to war four times in this century, but to our credit, never for the purpose of destroying freedom, always for the purpose of defending it; never for the purpose of breaking the peace, only for the purpose of keeping it. America is the strongest nation in the world today; but why? Not for the purpose of conquest, but only from that position of strength can we help to negotiate what we all want for ourselves and for other nations in the world: a whole generation of peace--something we Americans have not had in a century. That is a great goal. Americans are for it. Americans support it. And as we look toward that goal, and particularly as we see in this audience those who have given so much to their country, I say let us be worthy of them, worthy of the sacrifices of war by building a peace, a real peace, so that their sons and their children will not have to fight in another war, if that can be made possible. And second, to build a nation and a period of peace that means something more than simply the absence of war, that means a nation that has confidence in itself, a people that believe in this country, a people who are willing to make sacrifices for their country if they realize that what they give up is going to help all the country and all the people, and a people, also, who, as was the case in the beginning of this country, will recognize that America has a role in the world, and we are going to fulfill it. You remember 195 years ago when America was a poor nation, when it was a weak nation, Thomas Jefferson said, we act not just for ourselves, but for the whole human race. What a presumptuous statement it was to make then. But it was true then, because he knew that wealth and power was not what made a people great; it was the spirit of the people, and we had a great spirit, the Spirit of '76. And today when we are the strongest nation in the world, strong in arms and rich in goods, let it not be said that America was poor in spirit. I believe that America is rich in spirit. I believe that out across this Nation of ours, younger people, older people, have faith in our country. They want to build a generation of peace, and they want America to maintain the position of leadership in the world so that we can build that kind of peace that will mean something far more than the absence of war, that will mean better health, that will mean a cleaner and better environment, that will mean opportunity and freedom and justice such as people have never enjoyed in the history of the world. This is a great ideal, and speaking to my friends here in my home State of California, I cherish this opportunity to share those ideals with you. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslomalindauniversitylomalindacalifornia", "title": "Remarks at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-loma-linda-university-loma-linda-california", "publication_date": "20-08-1971", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 937, "text": "Mr. Chairman, delegates. I accept your nomination for President of the United States of America. I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you have placed in me. It is a great honor. It is an even greater responsibility. Tonight I am asking you to join me to walk together to a better future. By my side, I have chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. He represents the best of America, a man who will always make us proud - my friend and America's next Vice President, Paul Ryan. In the days ahead, you will get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan - a strong and caring leader who is down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands. I love the way he lights up around his kids and how he is not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom. But Paul, I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours. Four years ago, I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That president was not the choice of our party but Americans always come together after elections. We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than what divides us. When that hard fought election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have - optimistic and positive and confident in the future. That very optimism is uniquely American. It is what brought us to America. We are a nation of immigrants. We are the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called America could be better. They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world but for the richness of this life. Freedom. Freedom of religion. Freedom to speak their mind. Freedom to build a life. And yes, freedom to build a business. With their own hands. This is the essence of the American experience. We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future. When every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty, or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just ninety miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America they could build a better life, that in America their children would be more blessed than they. But today, four years from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future. It is not what we were promised. Every family in America wanted this to be a time when they could get ahead a little more, put aside a little more for college, do more for their elderly mom who is living alone now or give a little more to their church or charity. Every small business wanted these to be their best years ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that Little League team. Every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, and that they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future. This is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits. This was the hope and change America voted for. It is not just what we wanted. It is not just what we expected. It is what Americans deserved. You deserved it because during these years, you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid $22.50 an hour with benefits, you took two jobs at 9 bucks an hour and fewer benefits. You did it because your family depended on you. You did it because you are an American and you do not quit. You did it because it was what you had to do. But driving home late from that second job, or standing there watching the gas pump hit 50 dollars and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just was not right. But what could you do? Except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic. Hug your kids a little longer; maybe spend a little more time praying that tomorrow would be a better day. I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This is not something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we CAN do something. With your help we will do something. Now is the moment when we can stand up and say, I am an American. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better! So here we stand. Americans have a choice. A decision. To make that choice, you need to know more about me and about where I will lead our country. I was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when Americans were returning from war and eager to work. To be an American was to assume that all things were possible. When President Kennedy challenged Americans to go to the moon, the question was not whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there. The soles of Neil Armstrong's boots on the moon made permanent impressions on OUR souls and in our national psyche. Ann and I watched those steps together on her parent's sofa. Like all Americans we went to bed that night knowing we lived in the greatest country in the history of the world. God bless Neil Armstrong. Tonight that American flag is still there on the moon. And I do not doubt for a second that Neil Armstrong's spirit is still with us: that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American. That is how I was brought up. My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US Government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college and apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. And he had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him. He moved to Detroit, led a great automobile company and became Governor of the Great State of Michigan. We were Mormons and growing up in Michigan; that might have seemed unusual or out of place but I really do not remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to. My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would BE, and much less about what we would DO. Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love -- this world would be a far more gentle and better place. Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That is how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose. My mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation? I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin, Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Susana Martinez, Senator Kelly Ayotte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As Governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman Lt. Governor, a woman chief of staff, half of my cabinet and senior officials were women, and in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies. I grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy, like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around Michigan in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself. Those were not the easiest of days - too many long hours and weekends working, five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night. But if you ask Ann and I what we'd give, to break up just one more fight between the boys, or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room. Well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that. Those days were toughest on Ann, of course. She was heroic. Five boys, with our families a long way away. I had to travel a lot for my job then and I'd call and try to offer support. But every mom knows that does not help get the homework done or the kids out the door to school. I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine. And I knew without question, that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine. And as America saw Tuesday night, Ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to. Like a lot of families in a new place with no family, we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community it was welcoming and as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved to town or just joined our church. We had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregants from all walks of life and many who were new to America. We prayed together, our kids played together and we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways. And that is how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support, in good times and bad. It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families, our faiths. That is the bedrock of what makes America, America. In our best days, we can feel the vibrancy of America's communities, large and small. It is when we see that new business opening up downtown. It is when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on our block doing the same. It is when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job offer they should take.and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like is not far from home. It is that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kid's soccer team, or help out on school trips. But for too many Americans, these good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America? Many of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and Change had a powerful appeal. But tonight I'd ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, should not you feel that way now that he is President Obama? You know there is something wrong with the kind of job he is done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. The President has not disappointed you because he wanted to. The President has disappointed America because he has not led America in the right direction. He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience. When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies. We should bet on ourselves and on our advice. So we started a new business called Bain Capital. The only problem was, while WE believed in ourselves, nobody else did. We were young and had never done this before and we almost did not get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake. I had thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I did not . I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I did not want to go to hell too. Shows what I know. Another of my partners got the Episcopal Church pension fund to invest. Today there are a lot of happy retired priests who should thank him. That business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you know. An office supply company called Staples - where I am pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping; The Sports Authority, which became a favorite of my sons. We started an early childhood learning center called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised. At a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and built one in a corn field in Indiana. Today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States. These are American success stories. And yet the centerpiece of the President's entire re-election campaign is attacking success. Is it any wonder that someone who attacks success has led the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression? In America, we celebrate success, we do not apologize for it. We were not always successful at Bain. But no one ever is in the real world of business. That is what this President does not seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It is about dreams. Usually, it does not work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple. He came back and changed the world. It is the genius of the American free enterprise system - to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the American people with a system that is dedicated to creating tomorrow's prosperity rather than trying to redistribute today's. That is why every president since the Great Depression who came before the American people asking for a second term could look back at the last four years and say with satisfaction: you are better off today than you were four years ago. Except Jimmy Carter. And except this president. This president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that the next four years he will get it right. But this president cannot tell us that YOU are better off today than when he took office. America has been patient. Americans have supported this president in good faith. But today, the time has come to turn the page. Today the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us. To put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations. To forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be. Now is the time to restore the Promise of America. Many Americans have given up on this president but they have not ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America. What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound. It does not take a special government commission to tell us what America needs. What America needs is jobs. Lots of jobs. In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. Nearly one out of six Americans is living in poverty. Look around you. These are not strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans. His policies have not helped create jobs, they have depressed them. And this I can tell you about where President Obama would take America: His plan to raise taxes on small business will not add jobs, it will eliminate them; His assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China; His trillion dollar cuts to our military will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and also put our security at greater risk; His $716 billion cut to Medicare to finance Obamacare will both hurt today's seniors, and depress innovation - and jobs - in medicine. And his trillion-dollar deficits will slow our economy, restrain employment, and cause wages to stall. To the majority of Americans who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: if Barack Obama is re-elected, you will be right. I am running for president to help create a better future. A future where everyone who wants a job can find one. Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement. An America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon. And unlike the President, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. It has 5 steps. First, by 2020, North America will be energy independent by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables. Second, we will give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice, and every child should have a chance. Third, we will make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences. Fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget. And fifth, we will champion SMALL businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing Obamacare. Today, women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do. And let me make this very clear - unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class. As president, I will protect the sanctity of life. I will honor the institution of marriage. And I will guarantee America's first liberty: the freedom of religion. President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. MY promise...is to help you and your family. I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators. Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden. But on another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat. In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We are still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning. President Obama has thrown allies like Israel under the bus, even as he has relaxed sanctions on Castro's Cuba. He abandoned our friends in Poland by walking away from our missile defense commitments, but is eager to give Russia's President Putin the flexibility he desires, after the election. Under my administration, our friends will see more loyalty, and Mr. Putin will see a little less flexibility and more backbone. We will honor America's democratic ideals because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan. And under my presidency we will return to it once again. You might have asked yourself if these last years are really the America we want, the America won for us by the greatest generation. Does the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from China? No. Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for 23 million people and for half the kids graduating from college? No. Are its schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world? No. And does the America we want succumb to resentment and division? We know the answer. The America we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for America. There is no mention of their race, their party affiliation, or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to the UNITED States of America. That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity, and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past. That America, that united America, will preserve a military that is so strong, no nation would ever dare to test it. That America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our Creator, and codified in our Constitution. That united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly, and will give a helping hand to those in need. That America is the best within each of us. That America we want for our children. If I am elected President of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it. And with your help we will deliver it. Let us begin that future together tonight.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressacceptingthepresidentialnominationtherepublicannationalconventiontampa", "title": "Mitt Romney Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-tampa", "publication_date": "30-08-2012", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Mitt Romney"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 906, "text": "Thanks for coming. One of the reasons I like this job so much is, you get to be introduced by your wife. And I appreciate Laura's love and compassion for all children, and I appreciate the job she is doing. I am a lucky man to be able to call her my wife. And thanks for coming. The kidnaping of a child is every parent's worst nightmare. Yet, too many moms and dads have experienced this nightmare across America. Too many have suffered. I have just met with parents-Laura and I met with parents-who have had the most precious person in their lives suddenly and brutally taken away from them. Some of these parents were eventually reunited with their children. Some are still hoping and waiting. Some know they will never see their loved ones again in this earthly life. When a child's life or liberty or innocence is taken, it is a terrible, terrible loss.And those responsible have committed a terrible crime. Our society has a duty, has a solemn duty, to shield children from exploitation and danger. At this conference, we are discussing the steps that parents and community leaders and law enforcement can take to prevent such tragedies. I want to thank the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for helping organize this important and vital meeting. And I want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate the senior members of my administration who are leading the sessions at today's conference. I thank our Secretary of State Colin Powell, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Secretary Tommy Thompson, Secretary Rod Paige. I appreciate the Director of the FBI, Bob Mueller, for coming. And I want to thank the Commissioner, Robert Bonner, of the U.S. Customs. I know there is a lot of Members of Congress who are here. I see the great Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, is here, as well as other Members of Congress. Thank you all for coming. Thank you for taking this issue seriously, and thanks for joining with a lot of concerned citizens. I appreciate so very much the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They do a really good job for America. I want to thank Ernie Allen-I want to thank Ernie, and I want to thank Carolyn Atwell-Davis, the legal consultant, for their hard work and for their care and concern. I also want to thank Margaret Spellings, who is Assistant to ENTITY for Domestic Policy, for moderating this conference. And of course, I have got to say something about John Walsh, TV star. But he is a guy who cares deeply about our country, about the safety of our citizens. And John, thank you for the service you do on behalf of the American people. Our first duty as adults is to create an environment in which children can grow and thrive without fearing for their security. That is what we have got to do. Because children are so vulnerable, they need the care of adults. Because they are so vulnerable, those who are cruel and predatory often target our children. We see the dangers to our children in the cases of abduction, many of which are known to us all. Each year, tens of thousands of children are abducted by non-family members, often in connection with a crime. And while the overwhelming majority of these children are returned from abductions, too many are not. One is too many, particularly for the mom or dad who suffers deeply. We see the dangers in the experience of runaway children who are often victims of hunger and sickness and sexual abuse. Every year, assaults and illness and suicide take the lives of about 5,000 runaways. One life is too many. The threats to our children are found not just on the streets, but they are found on the technology which we use in our homes. The Internet is a wonderful tool for our children to broaden their knowledge, expand their minds, but the evils of the world have crept into the Internet. In 1 year alone, one in five children between the ages of 10 and 17 received a sexual solicitation over the Internet. With expanding use of the Internet and the heightened activity of predators searching for underage victims, more children are being lured into harmful and even tragic situations. In every region in the world, children can be vulnerable, not just here at home but children everywhere. Each year, about a million girls and boys are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Such trafficking is nothing less than a modern form of slavery, an unspeakable and unforgivable crime against the most vulnerable members of the global society. All these dangers put children at risk. All these dangers demand action to protect our children from harm. The Justice Department has made the prevention and investigation of child abductions a major priority. We are providing State and local authorities with access to fingerprint records and forensic experts and training on missing-children cases. We want the local authorities to have the best available technologies and skills in order to respond quickly. The Department sponsors a 24-hour hotline for reporting missing children, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We are waging a nationwide effort to prevent use of the Internet to sexually exploit children. We are seeking to almost double the funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces, which will help State and local authorities enforce laws against child pornography and exploitation. We are vigorously prosecuting those who prey on our children. We need to send a clear message: If you prey on our children, there will be serious, severe consequences. Earlier this year, in Operation Candyman, the FBI dismantled a major child pornography ring: they made more than 100 arrests. I am pleased that the House of Representatives passed the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act this year to revise and strengthen our pornography laws. The Senate needs to work with the House to get legislation done before they go home. We need to do everything we can to protect our children from the evils of pornography. We will not forget the suffering and struggles of America's runaway children. The Federal Government supports hundreds of emergency shelters and programs that reach out to young people living on the street, offering them food and comfort and counseling. These programs are mainly administered by community and faith-based groups. After all, it is in our faith-based community where we hear that universal call to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. It is in our faith-based groups that we find deep compassion to help those in need and who are troubled. And many of the runaway kids are troubled and in deep need of love. There are as many as 100,000 runaway children every year. And these children are vulnerable; they are vulnerable to exploitation. There are some great programs in America, people who are soldiers in the armies of compassion, one of which is the Covenant House. We are honored today to have Sister Mary Rose McGeady here. She runs the Covenant House. And if you do not know anything about the Covenant House and if you are interested in helping, support the Covenant House or programs like the Covenant House, because these people help those on the street, those young, vulnerable children on the street, to realize there is love in our society and there is hope for a better way. On the international front, the United States is acting vigorously against the trafficking of young people. Last February, I established an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. The task force is working hard to prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent future trafficking. The past year alone, the Department of Justice prosecuted four times as many traffickers as it did 2 years ago. We are making progress. We have got to continue to work with our friends and allies to prevent this scourge from not only spreading but to stop it. It is, as I said earlier, slavery. And this Nation stands against slavery of any kind. The responsibility to protect America's children is shared throughout our society by government at every level and by parents in every home. Parents, of course, are the first line of defense against danger. To help our parents protect their children, the Department of Education has distributed a new guidebook providing practical steps that parents can take to make their children safer, practical steps that make it clear about how a parent needs to deal with their child about the dangers facing children. And this information, you will be pleased to hear, is written in ways so that the children can actually understand what is on the page. The book tells mothers and fathers how to rehearse with their children what to say or do if they ever feel threatened. It is a practical guide to explain to children how to deal with predators that are smooth and seductive, how to deal with somebody that is a stranger that sounds sweet-talking but may in their heart be dark and dangerous for our children. The book also lists web sites that provide information about protecting children. Information is powerful, and it is important for our parents to know. Parents need to pay as much attention to their children, by the way, when they are on the Internet as when they are on a playground. They have got to know what their children are doing on the Internet. They have got to know with whom they are conversing. This guidebook will help. We are passing it out to the Nation's schools, and the schools will then make it available to parents. And as well, parents can request a copy of the guidebook, a practical go-by as to how to train your children how to deal with potential danger. And you can find it on missingkids.com. If you are interested, if you want a practical go-by, call up missingkids.com on the Internet, and you will get some practical steps as to how to help your children avoid danger. Sometimes, in spite of a family's best effort, the unthinkable does happen, and that is really sad. It breaks my heart to know that that continues to happen in America. At that point, the parents need the sup-port-when their child is abducted, the parents need immediate support of their communities, quick action to find their children. Time is of the essence. One of the most successful programs to locate abducted children is what is called the AMBER Plan. It is a voluntary partnership through which police and local broadcasters issue urgent bulletins to the public as soon as a child is missing. The program began in a local effort in Texas, I am proud to report, in the Dallas area in 1996 after Amber Hagerman was abducted. My friend State Senator Florence Shapiro is with us-I believe, one of the panelists. She helped launch the AMBER program. I know that it makes her feel really good to know that AMBER, when in place, can really help people, just like it helped Sharon Brooks and her 16-yearold daughter, Tamara. This summer, Tamara and Jacqueline were abducted at gunpoint in Lancaster, California. Tamara told us her story. The police issued an AMBER Alert within hours and soon received tips that led to their rescue. People all across America shared a great feeling of relief when she and her buddy were rescued. One of the reasons they were is because of the AMBER Plan. There are gaps in AMBER, however. There are gaps in the AMBER Plan coverage which must be filled, and we can fill them. We will develop more AMBER Plans and better coordination among plans. We should not allow another day to go by without taking steps to expand the AMBER Plan's reach all across our country. And so the Attorney General today is appointing an AMBER Alert Coordinator to help State and local officials develop, enhance, and coordinate AMBER Plans all across America. The Department of Justice will establish standards for the issuance and dissemination of alerts. The Justice and Transportation Departments will take immediate action to provide a total of $10 million to improve the growing network of AMBER Plans. We want AMBER Plan Alerts to be issued as quickly and as effectively as possible, including electronic billboards along the Nation's highways. I support legislation passed by Senator Hutchison of Texas and Senator Feinstein of California to achieve the goals I just outlined and codify them in law. And I want to thank you both for your hard work. The House has not acted yet, so I am going to. And that is why I have just laid out the initiative. If possible, it would be very helpful if the House passed the Hutchison-Feinstein law before they go home. I also am pleased that good corporate citizens are involved with helping our children. And I particularly want to point out Toys R Us or Wal-Mart, Home Depot, as well as Ford Motor dealerships, which are providing free child photo IDs, so that parents can provide law enforcement with sharply focused head-and-shoulder pictures along with relevant biological information in the event of emergency. By the end of this year, more than 2 1/2 million children will have been photographed and identified to help recover them if they are ever abducted. I hope a lot of other companies follow these good citizens' example. I hope you make available resources necessary to help us combat-to fight against abduction and to help save those lives-save the lives of those who have fallen prey to one of the worst crimes in our society. This White House Conference on Missing and Exploited and Runaway Children is important for America; it just is. And I want to thank you all for coming. This is the beginning of a refocused effort at the Federal level to help save people's lives. This is an attempt-more than an at-tempt-this is the beginning of a successful strategy implemented at all levels of government and all parts of our society to recognize a real threat and to deal with it, to recognize there are some so evil in our society that they are willing to harm our most precious and most vulnerable citizens, and to be prepared to respond quickly when that happens, to help people prevent it from happening in the first place, to make it clear, if you do it and we catch you, there is going to be serious consequences for you. We can deal with this problem, because this is America. This is a country full of people who love and care. It is a compassionate and decent nation. This is the beginning of a concerted effort to do our duty as responsible citizens of the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Again, I want to thank you all for taking your citizenship seriously. I want to thank you for understanding that a patriot is somebody more than who just puts their hand on their heart; a patriot is somebody who is willing to do whatever you can to make this country the best-continue to be the best on the face of our Earth. May God bless your efforts. May God bless our children. And may God bless America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehouseconferencemissingexploitedandrunawaychildren", "title": "Remarks at the White House Conference on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-white-house-conference-missing-exploited-and-runaway-children", "publication_date": "02-10-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 672, "text": "Thank you very much, Roman, Carl Curtis, all of you : First, I want to thank the people of Nebraska, Omaha, and especially all of you for the extremely warm welcome and the wonderful hospitality that has been shown. I am proud to be a native Nebraskan. I do want to thank you also for the kind of support and assistance that all of you have given. Without this kind of aid, cooperation, we could not be in this ball game and in the situation where we are today--where from all the reports I get, our chances are very good. Now, let me, if I might, take just a minute to give you the message as I see it, which I think epitomizes the last 21 months and which is the foundation from which, in my judgment, we have built for another good 4 years. If you would refresh your memories just a little, back to August of 1974, and then see what has transpired in the last 21 months, I think a person can say that there has been a record of peace, prosperity, and trust established. You know, in 1974 this country was going through great trauma as far as the economy was concerned. Inflation was over 12 percent. We have cut it, for the first 3 months of this year, down to under 3 percent. And the news we got yesterday about the Wholesale Price Index was one that we could have anticipated; you cannot always, in this situation, get every one of them as good as they have been the last 5 months. But the prospects overall, the trend as far as inflation is concerned is good, and it is going to stay on the decline. But if you look at the problems concerning the economy jobwise, we got some excellent news today. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Labor announced that in the month of April we had 700,000 more people on payrolls in this country, up to a total of 87,400,000--by far, the most employed in the history of the United States. So, I think a person can talk to his neighbor, to his partner, to his business associates, to anybody, and say that in the 21 months, we have taken this country through a tough, tough time by the right policies, by keeping our cool, beating the Congress over its head with 40 vetoes that have been sustained, where we have saved over $13 billion. It was not easy, believe me. We had a lot of advice from all sources saying that, Do what the Congress wants you to do, spend a lot more money, do this and do that. It was not right; we did not do it. And I think we are now in the process where we can say with pride that we are on the right track and we are going in the right direction. To summarize it, everything that is supposed to be going up is going up and everything that is supposed to be going down is going down. I think you know the record that we can also speak with great pride about. It is the first time that a ENTITY can seek election or reelection in the last 20 years where that ENTITY can say this country is at peace, and when we can say we are meeting our manpower needs without the draft. We are spending all of the money that is needed and necessary for good military programs : the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and Marines. We have this peace, we are going to keep it by being strong, diligent, alert, wall-prepared, well-led. And then, if we turn to the last point, if you will refresh your memories, 21 months ago this country had gone through a very, very serious loss of confidence. It was not an easy job, but I think by openness and candor and responsibility, frankness, integrity, we have helped to restore public confidence in the White House and in the executive branch. And so if we have an opportunity to do this job for another 4 years, I can promise you that the progress we have made will be increased tremendously in the 4 years. So, I hope and trust that you and all of your friends and neighbors will give us a chance to do so.Thank you very, very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspresidentfordcommitteereceptionomaha", "title": "Remarks at a President Ford Committee Reception in Omaha.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-president-ford-committee-reception-omaha", "publication_date": "07-05-1976", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

{"id": 1056, "text": "All right. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to join us. We are here with a wonderful group of homeowners. And I think for so many people around this country, the essence of the American Dream is owning your own home, being able to have that piece of property that is yours, that allows you to raise your kids, that represents your single biggest investment. And obviously, one of the triggers of the financial crisis and now the economic crisis that we have suffered is that because in some areas housing got--housing values got way overheated, in some cases you had a lack of regulation that allowed all sorts of complex financial instruments take advantage of homeowners. We have seen a collapse in the housing market, a precipitous drop in values, and that led to a lot of the problems in the financial markets. Here is the good news. At the beginning of this administration, we said we are--we were going to tackle directly the problems that homeowners were experiencing and figure out ways in which we could provide them assistance in reducing their interest rates, modifying their loans so that they would be in a position to stay in their homes and reduce their monthly payments. And around the table here you see some wonderful families who have taken advantage of what are now historically low mortgage rates, brought about in part by some extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve, but also brought about by the housing plan that Tim Geithner and Shaun Donovanhelped to design. What you have seen now is rates are as low as they have been since 1971. Three-quarters of the American people get their mortgages through a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac qualified loan. And as a consequence of us being able to reduce the interest rates that are available, we have now seen some extraordinary jumps in the rate of mortgage refinancings. And everybody here represents families who have saved hundreds of dollars a month, thousands of dollars a year in some cases, and that is money directly in their pocket. More importantly, what it is allowed them to do is to consolidate their loans in some cases, reduce the length of their mortgages in other cases. It has given them the kind of security and stability in their mortgage payments that a lot more people can take advantage of. So the main message that we want to send today is, there are 7 to 9 million people across the country who right now could be taking advantage of lower mortgage rates. That is money in their pocket. And we estimate that the average family can get anywhere from $1,600 to $2,000 a year in savings by taking advantage of these various mortgage programs that have been put in place. We have already seen a substantial jump, 88 percent increase in refinancings over the last month. We have seen Fannie Mae refinance $77 billion of mortgages in March, which is their highest volume in one month since 2003. And rates on 30-year mortgages have dropped to an alltime low of 4.78 percent. So we are at a time where people can really take advantage of this. And what we want to do is to send a message that if you are having problems with your mortgage, and even if you are not and you just want to save some money, you can go to makinghomeaffordable.gov--. And the way the web site is designed, you can plug in your information and immediately find out whether or not you are potentially eligible for one of these mortgage refinancings. Now, we are in the process of rolling out some additional phases to the program. Everybody here represent responsible homeowners who made their payments, who have jobs and income that support their mortgages. In some cases, people may have had difficulties because they lost a job, somebody in their family got sick, they may have missed some payments. And in those cases we also want to be helpful, and we are putting in place a loan modification program, working with banks, working with services, that will allow other folks who are closer to losing their home in a stronger position in the future. So there are a range of different programs that are available for a range of different types of borrowers. The main message we want to send today is, is that the programs that have been put in place can help responsible folks who have been making their payments, who are not looking for a handout, but this allows them to make some changes that will leave money in their pockets and leave them more secure in their homes. So we hope that everybody takes advantage of it. Again, the web site is makinghomeaffordable.gov--is that right?--makinghomeaffordable.gov, so get on the web site, find out what is available. Last point we want to make. As people have become aware that the Government is helping to promote refinancing, we are starting to see some scam artists out there who are contacting people saying, You can refinance your home. The Government has got a program; we are ready to help. Oh, but by the way, first you have got to pay some money. I just want everybody who is watching today to know that if somebody is asking you for money up front before they help you with your refinancing, it is probably a scam. So take advantage of makinghomeaffordable.gov, and that will allow you to figure out exactly how to proceed on this in a way that is making you money, saving you money, as opposed to costing you money. All right.

{"id": 898, "text": "I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the ENTITY I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our Nation impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself-nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days. In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment. Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit. Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men. Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources. Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly. Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments, so that there will be an end to speculation with other people's money; and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency. These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress, in special session, detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States. Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment. The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first considerations, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States-a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure. In the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor-the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others-the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors. If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife. With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems. Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations. It is to be hoped that the normal balance of Executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure. I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken Nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption. But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis-broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe. For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less. We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life. We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it. In this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinauguraladdress8", "title": "Inaugural Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/inaugural-address-8", "publication_date": "04-03-1933", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 581, "text": "For myself and Mrs. Johnson--and for the people of the United States--I am proud to extend to you and your wife our warmest and most cordial welcome to this country and to this Capital. We are particularly pleased that you come today as the first state visitor to Washington since our inauguration earlier this year. The United States has--and is proud to have--strong and friendly ties with many peoples and many nations on every continent. But we are especially gratified by the growth of such relations with your continent-and with your country. In these last two decades, independence has come for more than 1 billion people in 54 countries. Nowhere has this revolution of national independence had greater impact than in Africa. We are mindful, Mr. President, that less than 200 years ago our own forebears in America chose the course that you, and your generation, have chosen in these times. Mr. President, here in America we understand what is in your heart--and the hearts of your countrymen--when you say, as you did recently: If we wish to get along with and have relations with all nations, respecting their ideologies, we intend also and above all to evolve without interference. History and fortune have smiled upon the United States. We are privileged to have great strength. But we believe that our strength means little unless we use it toward the end of assuring peoples who choose freedom the fight to live without interference from neighbors or adversaries. This has been always a commitment of our people. As a great President, whom I know you admire, Abraham Lincoln, once said of our Declaration of Independence: It . . . gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and all should have an equal chance. In America today, this generation of Americans is determined to fulfill that ideal by all that we do in the world and by all that we do here at home. For all the long history of man, there have been injustices, there has been oppression, there has been evil. Today--in these times--we intend that these forces shall find not only their match but their master in the strength of our American Nation and in the moral resolve of our American people. Mr. President, we invite and welcome the attention of all nations--young and old--to the agenda of the Congress of the United States. Our concerns are many; our responsibilities are great. But this week and this session, the American Congress is devoting itself to taking up the challenge of those ancient enemies of all mankind--ignorance, poverty, disease, and discrimination. And, Mr. President, I want you to know that we are determined as a people to prevail against these foes. You, Mr. President, are committed deeply to economic progress to improve the lives of your people. You seek with neighboring states realistic means of cooperation to promote mutual welfare. You have steadfastly and wisely denied comfort to those who would subvert the hard-won freedom of your continent. These are aims which the American people support, too. We of this land covet no empire, we seek no dominion anywhere in the world. We seek as you seek an Africa of strong and prosperous nations living at peace with their neighbors, free to choose their own .paths of progress. To you, Mr. President, to your people, to all the peoples of Africa, the United States reaffirms its good will, its friendly support, and its resolute determination to stand with you in your struggle for human progress.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswelcomethewhitehousepresidentyameogouppervolta", "title": "Remarks of Welcome at the White House to President Yameogo of Upper Volta", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-welcome-the-white-house-president-yameogo-upper-volta", "publication_date": "29-03-1965", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

{"id": 966, "text": "It is with great honor and respect that I come before you today, the first American President ever to address the Japanese Diet. I have been in your country only 2 days. But speaking for my wife, Nancy, and myself, may I say you have more than made us feel at home. The warmth of your welcome has touched our hearts. In welcoming us, you pay tribute to the more than 230 million Americans whom I have the privilege to represent. From all of us all of them to you we reach out to say: The bonds of friendship which unite us are even greater than the ocean which divides us. Nichibei no yuho wa eien desu. It was a dozen years ago on an autumn day like this one that I first visited Japan, and today, as then, I feel energy, initiative, and industry surging through your country in a mighty current for progress. And just as before, I am struck by a unique gift of the Japanese people: You do not build your future at the expense of the grace and beauty of your past. Harmony is a treasured hallmark of Japanese civilization, and this has always been pleasing to Americans. Harmony requires differences to be joined in pursuit of higher ideals, many of which we share. When former President Ulysses S. Grant visited here in 1878, he discovered Japan is a land of enchantment. During his stay, he met with the Emperor, and their discussion turned to democracy, the pressing issue of the day. President Grant observed that governments are always more stable and nations more prosperous when they truly represent their people. I am proud to help carry forward the century-old tradition, meeting first with your Emperor on my arrival and now meeting with you a great milestone in your history: the 100th session of the Diet under the modern Japanese Constitution. In 6 years you will celebrate your 100th anniversary of representative government in Japan, just as we will celebrate the birth of our own Congress. I bring you the best wishes and heartfelt greetings from your American counterparts, the Congress of the United States. One cannot stand in this chamber without feeling a part of your proud history of nationhood and democracy, and the spirit of hope carrying the dreams of your free people. Of all the strengths we possess, of all the ties that bind us, I believe the greatest is our dedication to freedom. Japan and America stand at the forefront of the free nations and free economies in the world. Yes, we are 5,000 miles apart; yes, we are distinctly different in customs, language, and tradition; and yes, we are often competitors in the world markets. But I believe the people represented by this proud parliament and by my own United States Congress are of one heart in their devotion to the principles of our free societies. I am talking about principles that begin with the sacred worth of human life; the cherished place of the family; the responsibility of parents and schools to be teachers of truth, tolerance, hard work, cooperation, and love; and the role of our major institutions government, industry, and labor to provide the opportunities and security opportunities and security free people need to build and leave behind a better world for their children and their children's children. America and Japan are situated far apart, but we are united in our belief that freedom means dedication to the dignity, rights, and equality of man. Yukichi Fukuzawa, the great Meiji-era educator, said it for you: Heaven has made no man higher or no man lower than any other man. Our great American hero Abraham Lincoln put it in political perspective for us: No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent. We both value the right to have a government of our own choosing. We expect government to serve the people; we do not expect the people to serve government. America and Japan speak with different tongues, but both converse, worship, and work with the language of freedom. We defend the right to voice our views, to speak words of dissent without being afraid, and to seek inner peace through communion with our God. We believe in rewarding initiative, savings, and risk-taking. And we encourage those who set their sights on the farthest stars and chart new paths to progress through the winds and waters of commerce. Others censor and stifle their citizens. We trust in freedom to nurture the diversity and creativity that enriches us all. I like what your poet Basho said: Many kinds of plants and each one triumphant in its special blossoms. Finally, our freedom inspires no fear because it poses no threat. We intimidate no one, and we will not be intimidated by anyone. The United States and Japan do not build walls to keep our people in. We do not have armies of secret police to keep them quiet. We do not throw dissidents into so-called mental hospitals. And we would never cold-bloodedly shoot a defenseless airliner out of the sky. We share your grief for that tragic and needless loss of innocent lives. Our two countries are far from perfect. But in this imperfect and dangerous world, the United States and Japan represent the deepest aspirations of men and women everywhere to be free, to live in peace, and to create and renew the wealth of abundance and spiritual fulfillment. I have come to Japan because we have an historic opportunity, indeed, an historic responsibility. We can become a powerful partnership for good, not just in our own countries, not just in the Pacific region but throughout the world. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, my question is: Do we have the determination to meet the challenge of partnership and make it happen? My answer is without hesitation: Yes we do, and yes we will. For much of our histories, our countries looked inward. Well, those times have passed. With our combined economies accounting for half the output of the free world, we cannot escape our global responsibilities. Our industries depend on the importation of energy and minerals from distant lands. Our prosperity requires a sound international financial system and free and open trading markets. And our security is inseparable from the security of our friends and neighbors. The simple hope for world peace and prosperity will not be enough. Our two great nations, working with others, must preserve the values and freedoms our societies have struggled so hard to achieve. Nor should our partnership for peace, prosperity, and freedom be considered a quest for competing goals. We cannot prosper unless we are secure, and we cannot be secure unless we are free. And we will not succeed in any of these endeavors unless Japan and America work in harmony. I have come to your country carrying the heartfelt desires of America for peace. I know our desires are shared by Prime Minister Nakasone and all of Japan. We are people of peace. We understand the terrible trauma of human suffering. I have lived through four wars in' my lifetime. So, I speak not just as President of the United States, but also as a husband, a father, and as a grandfather. I believe there can be only one policy for preserving our precious civilization in this modern age. A nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought. The only value in possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they cannot be used ever. I know I speak for people everywhere when I say our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth. Arms control must mean arms reductions. America is doing its part. As I pledged to the United Nations less than 2 months ago, the United States will accept any equitable, verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at lower levels than currently exist. We want significant reductions, and we are willing to compromise. In the strategic arms reduction talks, American negotiators continue to press the Soviet Union for any formula that will achieve these objectives. In the longer range INF talks, we are pursuing the same course, even offering to eliminate an entire category of weapons. I am very conscious of our negotiating responsibility on issues that concern the safety and well-being of the Japanese people. And let me make one thing very plain. We must not and we will not accept any agreement that transfers the threat of longer range nuclear missiles from Europe to Asia. Our great frustration has been the other side's unwillingness to negotiate in good faith. We wanted to cut deep into nuclear arsenals, and still do. But they are blocking the dramatic reductions the world wants. In our good-faith effort to move the negotiations forward, we have offered new initiatives, provided for substantial reductions to equal levels, and the lower the level the better. But we shall wait. We still wait for the first positive response. Despite this bleak picture, I will not be deterred in my search for a breakthrough. The United States will never walk away from the negotiating table. Peace is too important. Common sense demands that we persevere, and we will persevere. We live in uncertain times. There are trials and tests for freedom wherever freedom stands. It is as stark as the tragedy over the Sea of Japan, when 269 innocent people were killed for the so-called cause of sacred airspace. It is as real as the terrorist attacks last month on the Republic of Korea's leadership in Rangoon and against American and French members of the international peacekeeping force in Beirut. And yes, it is as telling as the stonewalling of our adversaries at the negotiating table, and as their crude attempts to intimidate freedom-loving people everywhere. These threats to peace and freedom underscore the importance of closer cooperation among all nations. You have an old proverb that says, A single arrow is easily broken, but not three in a bunch. The stronger the dedication of Japan, the United States, and our allies to peace through strength, the greater our contributions to building a more secure future will be. The U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security must continue to serve us as the bedrock of our security relationship. Japan will not have to bear the burden of defending freedom alone. America is your partner. We will bear that burden together. The defense of freedom should be a shared burden. We can afford to defend freedom; we cannot afford to lose it. The blessings of your economic miracle, created with the genius of a talented, determined, and dynamic people, can only be protected in the safe harbor of freedom. In his book, In Quest of Peace and Freedom, former Prime Minister Sato wrote: In the hundred years since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has constantly endeavored to catch up and eventually overtake the more advanced countries of the world. Well, I do not think I will be making headlines when I say, you have not only caught up; in some eases, you have pulled ahead. Here again, our partnership is crucial. But this time, you can be teachers. To all those who lack faith in the human spirit, I have just three words of advice: Come to Japan. Come to a country whose economic production will soon surpass the Soviet Union's, making Japan's economy the second largest in the entire world. Come to learn from a culture that instills in its people a strong spirit of cooperation, discipline, and striving for excellence; and yes, learn from government policies which helped create this economic miracle not so much by central planning, as by stimulating competition, encouraging initiative, and rewarding savings and risk-taking. Our country has made great strides in this direction during the last 3 years. We are correcting past mistakes. Hope is being reborn. Confidence is returning. America's future looks bright again. We have turned the corner from overtaxing, overspending, record interest rates, high inflation, and low growth. The United States is beginning the first stage of a new industrial renaissance, and we are helping pull other nations forward to worldwide recovery. But some in my country still flinch from the need to restrain spending. Under the guise of lowering deficits, they would turn back to policies of higher taxes. They would ignore the lesson of Japan. A look at Japan's postwar history yields two stunning conclusions. Among the major industrialized countries, your tax burden has remained the lowest and your growth and saving rates the highest. Savers in Japan can exempt very large amounts of interest income from taxation. Your taxes on so-called unearned income are low. You have no capital gains tax on securities for investors. And the overwhelming majority of your working people face tax rates dramatically lower than in the other industrial countries, including my own. And incentives for everyone-that is the secret of strong growth for a shining future filled with hope, and opportunities and incentives for growth, not tax increases, is our policy for America. Sometimes I wonder if we should not further our friendship by my sending our Congress here and you coming over and occupying our Capitol Building for a while. Partnership must be a two-way street grounded in mutual trust. Let us always be willing to learn from each other and cooperate together. We have every reason to do so. Our combined economies account for almost 35 percent of the world's entire economic output. We are the world's two largest overseas trading partners. Last year Japan took about 10 percent of our total exports, and we bought some 25 percent of yours. Our two-way trade will exceed $60 billion in 1983, more than double the level of just 7 years ago. At the Williamsburg summit last May, the leaders of our industrial democracies pledged to cooperate in rolling back protectionism. My personal commitment to that goal is based on economic principles, old-fashioned common sense, and experience. I am old enough to remember what eventually happened the last time countries protected their markets from competition: It was a nightmare called the Great Depression. And it was worldwide. World trade fell at that time by 60 percent. And everyone-workers, farmers, and manufacturers were hurt. Let us have the wisdom never to repeat that policy. We are in the same boat with our trading partners around the globe. And if one partner in the boat shoots a hole in the boat, it does not make much sense for the other partner to shoot another hole in the boat. Some say, yes, and call that getting tough. Well, forgive me, but I call it getting wet all over. Rather than shoot holes, let us work together to plug them up so our boat of free markets and free trade and fair trade can lead us all to greater economic growth and international stability. I have vigorously opposed quick fixes of protectionism in America. Anticompetitive legislation like the local content rule, which would force our domestic manufacturers of cars to use a rising share of U.S. labor and parts now, this would be a cruel hoax. It would be raising prices without protecting jobs. We would buy less from you. You would buy less from us. The world's economic pie would shrink. Retaliation and recrimination would increase. It is not easy for elected officials to balance the concerns of constituents with the greater interests of the Nation, but that is what our jobs are all about. And we need your help in demonstrating free trade to address concerns of my own people. Americans believe your markets are less open than ours. We need your support to lower further the barriers that still make it difficult for some American products to enter your markets easily. Your government's recent series of actions to reduce trade barriers are positive steps in this direction. We very much hope this process will continue and accelerate. In turn, I pledge my support to combat protectionist measures in my own country. If we each give a little, we can all gain a lot. As two great and mature democracies, let us have the faith to believe in each other, to draw on our long and good friendship, and to make our partnership grow. We are leaders in the world economy. We and the other industrialized countries share a responsibility to open up capital and trading markets, promote greater investment in each other's country, assist developing nations, and stop the leakage of military technology to an adversary bent on aggression and domination. We believe that the currency of the world's second largest free-market economy should reflect the economic strength and political stability that you enjoy. We look forward to the yen playing a greater role in international financial and economic affairs. We welcome the recent trend toward a stronger yen. And we would welcome Japan's increasingly active role in global affairs. Your leadership in aid to refugees and in economic assistance to various countries has been most important in helping to promote greater stability in key regions of the world. Your counsel on arms reduction initiatives is highly valued by us. We may have periodic disputes, but the real quarrel is not between us. It is with those who would impose regimentation over freedom, drudgery over dynamic initiative, a future of despair over the certainty of betterment, and the forced feeding of a military Goliath over a personal stake in the products and progress of tomorrow. You and your neighbors are shining examples for all who seek rapid development. The Pacific Basin represents the most exciting region of economic growth in the world today. Your people stretch your abilities to the limit, and when an entire nation does this, miracles occur. Being a Californian I have seen many miracles hardworking Japanese have brought to our shores. In 1865 a young Samurai student, Kanaye Nagasawa, left Japan to learn what made the West economically strong and technologically advanced. Ten years later he founded a small winery at Santa Rosa, California, called the Fountaingrove Round Barn and Winery. Soon he became known as the grape king of California. Nagasawa came to California to learn and stayed to enrich our lives. Both our countries owe much to this Japanese warrior-turned-businessman. As the years pass, our contacts continue to increase at an astounding rate. Today some 13,000 of your best college and graduate students are studying in America, and increasing numbers of U.S. citizens are coming here to learn everything they can about Japan. Companies like Nissan, Kyocera, Sony, and Toshiba have brought thousands of jobs to America's shores. The State of California is planning to build a rapid speed train that is adapted from your highly successful bullet train. In 1985 the United States will join Japan in a major exhibition of science and technology at Tsukuba, another symbol of our cooperation. For my part, I welcome this new Pacific tide. Let it roll peacefully on, carrying a two-way flow of people and ideas that can break from barriers of suspicion and mistrust and build up bonds of cooperation and shared optimism. Our two nations may spring from separate pasts; we may live at opposite sides of the Earth; but we have been brought together by our indomitable spirit of determination, our love of liberty, and devotion to progress. We are like climbers who begin their ascent from opposite ends of the mountain. The harder we try, the higher we climb and the closer we come together-until that moment we reach the peak and we are as one. It happened just last month. One American and two Japanese groups began climbing Mt. Everest the Japanese from the side of Nepal and the Americans from the side of Tibet. The conditions were so difficult and dangerous that before it ended two Japanese climbers tragically lost their lives. But before that tragedy, those brave climbers all met and shook hands just under the summit. And then, together, they climbed to the top to share that magnificent moment of triumph. Good and dear friends of Japan, if those mountaineers could join hands at the top of the world, imagine how high our combined 350 million citizens can climb, if all of us work together as powerful partners for the cause of good. Together there is nothing that Japan and America cannot do.Thank you very much. God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbeforethejapanesediettokyo", "title": "Address Before the Japanese Diet in Tokyo", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-the-japanese-diet-tokyo", "publication_date": "11-11-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 936, "text": "Good morning. Sorry to keep you waiting, I was getting further updates. I spoke with Governor Hochul of New York and Governor Murphy of New Jersey, and I plan to speak with Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania after last night's devastating storm and floods from Hurricane Ida, the fifth largest hurricane in our history. Record rain fell in these states and New York recorded more rain yesterday on the first day of September than it usually sees the entire month of September. We saw more than three inches of rain per hour fall in Central Park. The United States National Weather Service issued a flood emergency in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and parts of Long Island last night. This is the first time that such a warning has ever been issued for the city. People were trapped in subways with heroic men and women the New York Fire Department rescued all of them, they were trapped. We are seeing the same story of devastation and heroism across New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well. For now, 11 people in New York and New Jersey died because of the storm and I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the first responders and everyone who is been working through the night and well into the morning to save lives and get power back. There is a lot of damage and I made it clear to the governors that my team at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is on the ground and ready to provide all the assistance that is needed. In fact, our FEMA Director and Administrator, Deanna Griswell, was the chief federal response officer after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, she knows what to do. Last night at the request of California Governor, Newsom, I approved an emergency declaration for California for the counter of fire which is burning aggressively toward Lake Tahoe Basin and in Nevada. And it is also one of the few fires that has ever burned from one side of the stair in Nevada mountain range to the other. So far it is burned more than 200,000 acres. Tens of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes. The fire is threatening close to 35,000 structures and more than 4,400 firefighters from the state and my federal team are working to contain and suppress this raging wildfire. The Department of Defense has trained and is deploying additional firefighters to support our ongoing firefighting efforts in California. This disaster declaration will help with evacuation, including sheltering and feeding for those who have been displaced. I want you to know, I have seen these firefighters up close. Their courage is astounding and they are some of the bravest people I have ever known, and I have known a lot of them. My heart goes out to them. My thanks is an abundant thanks for what they do. Now, I want to provide an update in our efforts to help millions of Americans down south recover and rebuild from Hurricane Ida. We have been monitoring this hurricane closely and the devastation it is caused. To date six deaths, about a million homes without power in Louisiana and Mississippi. While the catastrophic flooding was not as severe as it was during Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago, Ida was so powerful that it caused the Mississippi River to change direction, the flow, changed the flow temporarily. The good news is that as a result of a significant multi-billion dollar federal investment in the levee system around Metro in New Orleans, it held, it was strong, it worked. But too many people and too many areas are still unprotected and saw a storm surge and flooding that was devastating. We have seen the reports of winds up to 170 miles per hour. It is not been confirmed yet by FEMA, but 170 miles an hour, causing unimaginable damage with debris and down power lines, making roads impassable and slowing response efforts to save folks and property. Now, people continue to shelter-in-place. Tomorrow, I will be traveling to Louisiana to meet with Governor John Bel Edwards as well as the parish presidents and mayors and the local officials representing the effected areas. Governor Edwards encouraged me to come and assured me that my visit will not disrupt recovery efforts on the ground, that is what I wanted to be sure of. My message to everyone affected is we are all in this together, the nation is here to help. That is the message I have been making clear to the mayors, governors, energy and utility leaders in the region who my administration has been working closely with over the past few days. Working with governors in the area, even before Ida made landfall, I issued an emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi to help us respond quickly. FEMA pre-positioned more than 4.3 million meals and more than 3 million liters of water and other critical resources in the region before it hit. We deployed more than 250 generators and we are working into getting more into the area, especially the hospitals that desperately need them. The Department of Health and Human Services deployed a 250-bed federal medical shelter in New Orleans and five medical assistance teams available throughout the state. As the hurricane hit, more than 600 members of the National Guard have been activated in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, and other states to support search and rescue and recovery efforts. For those who have lost their home, states have been working with the American Red Cross to open almost 50 shelters across the Gulf Coast. We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part. We need to get power restored, we need to get more food, fuel, and water deployed. I get hourly updates on the progress from FEMA, well into the night, and we will be working around the clock until the critical needs of the region are fully met and we will meet them. Even as we tackle the core elements of the disaster response, we are also deploying new tools to help speed this recovery, things that have not been used very much in prior hurricane responses. Working with private companies that own and operate the lifeline infrastructure like electricity and communications, we have used the latest technology to accelerate restoration of power and cell phone service. It is beginning to get back up, there is a long way to you go. For example, to minimum the amount of time it will take to get the power back to everyone I have directed the federal aviation commission, the FAA, authorize the use of surveillance drones to assess Ida's damage to energy infrastructure while ensuring those slights to not disrupt aerial search and rescue missions. Likewise, I have asked the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy to immediately make available any satellite imagery they can help provide in assessing the extent of the damage. Drones and satellites can make the work faster by getting to the places that are most desperately in need. They can identify where the lines are down, map the damage, help get the transmission lines back up and running in all the parishes. But people, hardworking people, do the complicated and dangerous work. There are more than 25,000 linemen and clearance crews from 32 states and the District of Columbia racing to restore power. In Alabama two have died on the job. This is complicated and really dangerous work, but we are moving as fast as humanly possible to get it done. It is important to know that the region hit by Ida is a key center of our nation's oil production and refining infrastructure, that is why we are not waiting to assess the full impact the storm is going to have on oil production and refineries. We are moving already quickly to increase the availability of gas and easing the pressure on gas prices around the country. I have directed the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, to use all of the tools at her disposal, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep gas flowing to the pumps. In order to get critical supplies to the region to beat the pandemic, I directed the Department of Transportation to renew an energy declaration to provide flexibility on how many hours a truck driver can drive. Most people do not know there is a limitation on the number of hours you can be on the road. The transportation department is broadening that emergency declaration to include transportation of gasoline and other types of fuel as well in addition to medical supplies and food. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved emergency waivers for Louisiana and Mississippi that will expand the supply of gasoline that can be sold in those states and increase availability at such a critical time. These actions should help reduce the risk of gas shortages and price increases as a result of the hurricane. We also know a lot of people lost cell phone service because their particular carrier's tower went down or got damaged. A few days ago I asked the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, and my White House team to work with the cell phone companies to allow customers to use roaming services, so that means that folks in the area should be able to get a signal no matter what carrier they are up on. If they are one carrier down they can roam and use another carrier they are not part of, they are not signed up with. Just think of the sons and the daughters, moms and dads, and loved ones trying to reach each other and the feeling of fear or maybe something happened and it is just because the cell phones not working. Think of the millions of people reaching out for help. This is important and it is critical. Now, a lot of private companies and public entities are doing their part. Today I am calling on insurance companies not to evade the responsibility, to keep the priorities they made to their customers and the promises they made and help some folks who are hurting. Here is the deal, FEMA is providing critical needs assistance, for example, to help the hotel bill you racked up because you could not stay in your home during the hurricane. The Department of Housing and Urban affairs, HUD, is also offering assistance to families in impacted areas, but right now we are hearing reports that some insurance companies may deny coverage for additional living assistance expenses unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. People pay their insurance premiums and they are supposed to get payments from their insurance companies for relocation costs, but insurance companies in the face of the strongest storm since 1850 say, No, no, we are not going to pay you what we owe you, because the fact is parishes in Louisiana like Orleans and St. John's issued a voluntary event order at first and may not have even had enough time to make a mandatory one as the storm moved in so fast. Other parishes, a voluntary evacuation order suggested that residents could try to protect themselves by sheltering in place against the ferocious winds. We can all understand why folks felt safest leaving their homes and going elsewhere, out of the path of the devastating storm. No one, no one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip, to be able to stay in a hotel, they left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death, there is nothing voluntary about that, so I am calling on the private insurance companies right now at this critical moment, do not hide behind the fine print and technicality. Do your job. Keep your commitments to your communities that you insured. Do the right thing and pay your policy holders what do you owe them to cover the cost of temporary housing in the midst of a natural disaster. Help those in need, that is what all of us need to do. That is what we are trying to do. I have tasked my Senior Advisor, Cedric Richmond, a New Orleans neighbor and former Congressman from Louisiana's 2nd District for 10 years to lead this relief effort. He knows the area, he knows the people, he knows how to get things done. He knows they get things done when local, state, and federal level are all working together alongside the private sector. The people of Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient and resourceful. We are going to stand with you for as long as it takes to recover and allow you to rebuild. And to the country, the past few days of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the west and the unprecedented flash floods in New York and New Jersey is yet another reminder that these extreme storms and the climate crisis are here. We best be better prepared. We need to act. When Congress returns this month I am going to press for their action on my Build Back Better Plan. That is going to make historic investments in electrical infrastructure, modernizing our roads, bridges, our water systems, sewer and draining systems, electric grids and transmission lines and make them more resilient to these superstorms and wildfires, and floods that are going to happen with increasing frequency and ferocity. We are reminded that this is not about politics. Hurricane Ida did not care if you were a Democrat or a Republican, rural or urban, this destruction is everywhere and it is a matter of life and death and we are all in this together. This is one of the great challenges of our time, but I am confident we will meet it. We are the United States of America and there is simply nothing, you have heard me say it before, nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. So for all those who are still in harm's way, for all those struggling to deal with the aftermath of these storms and fires, I say, God bless you. Keep the faith. Everyone working day and night to look out for their fellow Americans is what this is about. We are going to get this done. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenhurricaneidafederalresponsespeechbriefingtranscriptseptember2", "title": "Joe Biden Hurricane Ida Federal Response Speech Briefing Transcript September 2", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-hurricane-ida-federal-response-speech-briefing-transcript-september-2", "publication_date": "02-09-2021", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Joe Biden"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 825, "text": "It is an honor to be here today with the members of the American Tort Reform Association. You know, we'd originally planned to meet across the street in the White House, but it turned out there was so much interest, we had to find a bigger hall. And many thanks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the chamber president, Dick Lesher, for permitting us to come here. Now, I know that you have already heard from the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce and a number of others, so I will try to keep my own remarks brief. Given the subject, I would not want anyone to mistake me for a lawyer. But looking out, I can see what a diverse group we make up from Boy Scouts to businessmen, from campers to child-care workers. This is an all-American event, because this problem affects all of America-every man, woman, and child. Originally, of course, tort law protected innocent people against wrongful damage or injury. Rooted in the Middle Ages, tort law became especially important at the onset of the Industrial Revolution, when ordinary men and women began to find themselves presented with services and products they'd never before encountered. By providing consumers with a measure of protection, tort law enabled them to enter this new marketplace with a certain confidence and ease. Back in the days when toothpaste was a newfangled invention, for example, consumers could purchase it with a much greater sense of assurance when they knew that, because of tort law, the manufacturers had to take all reasonable steps to make certain that the product was both effective and safe. Maybe some of you will remember a passage in Huckleberry Finn that deals with this very subject. Huck met a swindler who told him that: I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth, and it does take it off, too, and generally the enamel along with it. [ Twain never mentions tort law, but it is there in the background, the force that kept this character in the book constantly on the run up and down the Mississippi. And in the real world it was, in large part, tort law that reduced such swindlers from an actual presence in our economic life to figures that we remember with laughter. So, over the years, tort law has helped us drive the malevolent and the negligent out of the marketplace. This, in turn, has permitted legitimate economic innovation to take its course and raise living standards throughout the Nation. More recently, however, tort law began to go terribly wrong. Twisted and abused, tort law has become a pretext for outrageous legal outcomes outcomes that impede our economic life, not promote it. Listen to just a few cases, and I hope I will not be repeating some that maybe have already been told to you. In California, a man was using a public telephone booth to place a call. An alleged drunk driver careened down the street, lost control of her car, and crashed into the phone booth. Now, it is no surprise that the injured man sued. But you might be startled to hear whom he sued: the telephone company and associated firms. That is right, according to Chief Justice Rose Bird of the California Supreme Court, a jury could find that the companies responsible for the design, location, installation, and maintenance of the telephone booth were liable. In another case, suit was brought by a man who suffered a heart attack while having some trouble starting a lawn mower. He claimed that pulling the starter rope was the cause of the attack. His award? More than a million dollars. I suppose all this might be amusing if such absurd results only took place occasionally. Yet today they have become all but commonplace. In the past two decades the number of awards involving a million dollars or more has climbed from just 1 a year to more than 400 a year. Between 1975 and 1985, the average award in a product liability case more than quadrupled, to some $1.8 million. During the same period, the average medical malpractice verdict I said average went up more than 350 percent, to over a million dollars. This expansion of tort liability penalizes virtually every American-manufacturers, doctors, small businessmen, government at all levels, nonprofit organizations, entrepreneurs, and perhaps most severely, the consumer. Again, listen to a few more cases. On one of the Hawaiian islands, all the doctors on that island who had once delivered babies have stopped doing so because their malpractice premiums were outstripping their fees; pregnant women must now travel elsewhere, to another island, for their needs. In 1984 Connaught Laboratories discontinued distribution of an important vaccine for children because it could not obtain liability insurance. It later succeeded in doing so, but only at a very high cost. As a result, in just 3 years the cost of this vaccine rose from 11 cents per dose to $4.50. Hundreds of American cities and towns find themselves unable to afford basic liability coverage. The city of Blue Lake, California, has been forced to shut its skating rink, tennis court, and parks. And at New York's famous Coney Island Amusement Park, they have had to close the roller coaster. Even everyday items contain hidden costs that arise from the expansion of tort liability. It is been estimated, for example, that 20 percent of the cost of an ordinary stepladder goes to pay for liability insurance, lawyers, and related costs. And because the Boy Scouts of America have been forced to increase their insurance coverage, it is feared that every Boy Scout and Cub Scout troop may have to be assessed some $20-not an insignificant sum in the underprivileged neighborhoods that perhaps need the Boy Scouts most. These problems have begun to eat away at the fabric of American life. My friends, I think you will agree: There is still such a thing as common sense, and this ain't it! The time has come for action. Earlier this year I endorsed the report of my Domestic Policy Council's Tort Policy Working Group. This report contains a number of recommendations, recommendations that include fixed-dollar limitations for certain kinds of awards and the establishment of assurances that liability judgments go to those actually wronged or injured and not to the lining of their attorney's pockets. Now, one of the report's most important recommendations urged our administration to submit reform legislation to the Congress. This legislation, carefully drafted, has now been introduced in the Congress by Senator Robert Kasten and Congressman Hamilton Fish. It restores the fault standard, which requires that actual fault or wrongdoing must be established in most cases before liability can be assessed. It limits pain-and-suffering and punitive damage awards, awards the amount contingency-fee lawyers could earn, and restricts the joint and several liability doctrine that can force a single defendant to pay all damages even if he is only partly to blame. To be sure, much tort law would remain to be reformed by the 50 States, not the Federal Government. And in our Federal system of government this is only right. Many of the Tort Policy Working Group recommendations, for example, would have to be implemented at the State level to be fully effective. This administration's bill represents a much-needed overhaul of Federal laws governing interstate commerce one of the fields of authority the Federal Government is specifically granted by the Constitution and sets an example of common sense for the rest of the Nation to follow. Many here have been following this issue closely. Indeed, there are stalwarts in this hall who have been out front since the beginning, and I am grateful for your support. Now I ask you to join me in urging the Congress to pass this bill and to do so with dispatch. I said at the outset that tort law is a practical matter that affects us all, but in making the case for reform I find that I may have had to be a little more technical than I intended. Maybe with the Boy Scouts' help I can bring it all back down to Earth. Boy Scouts know a code by heart, a list of characteristics that they promise they will try to live up to; and the first word on that list is trustworthy. A scout is trustworthy. That is really what tort reform comes down to-asking our fellow citizens to be trustworthy. It means writing laws that tell all those who provide us with goods and services that we expect them to pay attention to their work and to do a good job. But it also means eliminating legal constraints that place upon these same people undue burdens. Trustworthiness, my friends let us make this our ideal, and let us see to it that our laws reflect that ideal for the good of all. Thank you all for you patience and for being here, and God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmemberstheamericantortreformassociation", "title": "Remarks to Members of the American Tort Reform Association", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-members-the-american-tort-reform-association", "publication_date": "30-05-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 842, "text": "All our fighting men overseas today have their appointed stations on the far-flung battlefronts of the world. We at home have ours too. We need, we are proud of, our fighting men most decidedly. But, during the anxious times ahead, let us not forget that they need us too. It goes almost without saying that we must continue to forge the weapons of victory- the hundreds of thousands of items, large and small, essential to the waging of the war. This has been the major task from the very start, and it is still a major task. This is the very worst time for any war worker to think of leaving his machine or to look for a peacetime job. And it goes almost without saying, too, that we must continue to provide our Government with the funds necessary for waging war not only by the payment of taxes- which, after all, is an obligation of American citizenship but also by the purchase of war bonds- an act of free choice which every citizen has to make for himself under the guidance of his own conscience. Whatever else any of us may be doing, the purchase of war bonds and stamps is something all of us can do and should do to help win the war. I am happy to report tonight that it is something which nearly everyone seems to be doing. Although there are now approximately sixty-seven million persons who have or earn some form of income, eighty-one million persons or their children have already bought war bonds. They have bought more than six hundred million individual bonds. Their purchases have totaled more than thirty-two billion dollars. These are the purchases of individual men, women, and children. Anyone who would have said this was possible a few years ago would have been put down as a starry-eyed visionary. But of such visions is the stuff of America fashioned. Of course, there are always pessimists with us everywhere, a few here and a few there. I am reminded of the fact that after the fall of France in 1940 I asked the Congress for the money for the production by the United States of fifty thousand airplanes per year. Well, I was called crazy it was said that the figure was fantastic; that it could not be done. And yet today we are building airplanes at the rate of one hundred thousand a year. There is a direct connection between the bonds you have bought and the stream of men and equipment now rushing over the English Channel for the liberation of Europe. There is a direct connection between your bonds and every part of this global war today. Tonight, therefore, on the opening of this Fifth War Loan Drive, it is appropriate for us to take a broad look at this panorama of world war, for the success or the failure of the drive is going to have so much to do with the speed with which we can accomplish victory and the peace. While I know that the chief interest tonight is centered on the English Channel and on the beaches and farms and the cities of Normandy, we should not lose sight of the fact that our armed forces are engaged on other battlefronts all over the world, and that no one front can be considered alone without its proper relation to all. It is worth while, therefore, to make over-all comparisons with the past. Let us compare today with just two years ago-June, 1942. At that time Germany was in control of practically all of Europe, and was steadily driving the Russians back toward the Ural Mountains. Germany was practically in control of North Africa and the Mediterranean, and was beating at the gates of the Suez Canal and the route to India. Italy was still an important military and supply factor- as subsequent, long campaigns have proved. Japan was in control of the western Aleutian Islands; and in the South Pacific was knocking at the gates of Australia and New Zealand- and also was threatening India. Japan had seized control of most of the Central Pacific. American armed forces on land and sea and in the air were still very definitely on the defensive, and in the building-up stage. Our allies were bearing the heat and the brunt of the attack. In 1942 Washington heaved a sigh of relief that the first war bond issue had been cheerfully oversubscribed by the American people. Way back in those days, two years ago, America was still hearing from many amateur strategists and political critics, some of whom were doing more good for Hitler than for the United States- two years ago. But today we are on the offensive all over the world bringing the attack to our enemies. In the Pacific, by relentless submarine and naval attacks, and amphibious thrusts, and ever-mounting air attacks, we have deprived the Japs of the power to check the momentum of our ever-growing and ever-advancing military forces. We have reduced the Japs' shipping by more than three million tons. We have overcome their original advantage in the air. We have cut off from a return to the homeland tens of thousands of beleaguered Japanese troops who now face starvation or ultimate surrender. And we have cut down their naval strength, so that for many months they have avoided all risk of encounter with our naval forces. True, we still have a long way to go to Tokyo. But, carrying out our original strategy of eliminating our European enemy first and then turning all our strength to the Pacific, we can force the Japanese to unconditional surrender or to national suicide much more rapidly than has been thought possible. Turning now to our enemy who is first on the list for destruction- Germany has her back against the wall- in fact three walls at once! In the south- we have broken the German hold on central Italy. On June 4, the city of Rome fell to the Allied armies. And allowing the enemy no respite, the Allies are now pressing hard on the heels of the Germans as they retreat northwards in evergrowing confusion. On the east our gallant Soviet allies have driven the enemy back from the lands which were invaded three years ago. The great Soviet armies are now initiating crushing blows. Overhead vast Allied air fleets of bombers and fighters have been waging a bitter air war over Germany and Western Europe. They have had two major objectives: to destroy German war industries which maintain the German armies and air forces; and to shoot the German Luftwaffe out of the air. As a result, German production has been whittled down continuously, and the German fighter forces now have only a fraction of their former power. This great air campaign, strategic and tactical, is going to continue with increasing power. And on the west the hammer blow which struck the coast of France last Tuesday morning, less than a week ago, was the culmination of many months of careful planning and strenuous preparation. Millions of tons of weapons and supplies, and hundreds of thousands of men assembled in England, are now being poured into the great battle in Europe. I think that from the standpoint of our enemy we have achieved the impossible. We have broken through their supposedly impregnable wall in northern France. But the assault has been costly in men and costly in materials. Some of our landings were desperate adventures; but from advices received so far, the losses were lower than our commanders had estimated would occur. We have established a firm foothold. We are now prepared to meet the inevitable counterattacks of the Germans with power and with confidence. And we all pray that we will have far more, soon, than a firm foothold. Americans have all worked together to make this day possible. The liberation forces now streaming across the Channel, and up the beaches and through the fields and the forests of France are using thousands and thousands of planes and ships and tanks and heavy guns. They are carrying with them many thousands of items needed for their dangerous, stupendous undertaking. There is a shortage of nothing nothing! And this must continue. What has been done in the United States since those days of 1940 when France fell in raising and equipping and transporting our fighting forces, and in producing weapons and supplies for war, has been nothing short of a miracle. It was largely due to American teamwork teamwork among capital and labor and agriculture, between the armed forces and the civilian economy indeed among all of them. And every one every man or woman or child- who bought a war bond helped and helped mightily! There are still many people in the United States who have not bought war bonds, or who have not bought as many as they can afford. Everyone knows for himself whether he falls into that category or not. In some cases his neighbors know too. To the consciences of those people, this appeal by the President of the United States is very much in order. For all of the things which we use in this war, everything we send to our fighting allies, costs money a lot of money. One sure way every man, woman, and child can keep faith with those who have given, and are giving, their lives, is to provide the money which is needed to win the final victory. I urge all Americans to buy war bonds without stint. Swell the mighty chorus to bring us nearer to victory!", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat3", "title": "Fireside Chat.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-3", "publication_date": "12-06-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 795, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, we can get all this out of the way early. It is a distinct privilege for Barbara and me to salute this evening an extraordinary leader of honor, compassion, and courage. With the greatest admiration, we welcome to the White House Nicaragua's President, Violeta Chamorro. Or, as I hear she was known by her growing family, or the family growing up, Madre Superiora. For those of you who do not speak good Spanish -- -- that means Mother Superior. For even as a young girl, Violeta could get her brothers and sisters standing at attention as she cracked her benevolent whip to get her family's house in order. Well, now, this Mother Superior is getting her nation's house in order, and we honor her for it. We honor her as the conciliator who is forging a future of peace and unity for her beleaguered land, as the elected leader who ended a bitter civil war and who replaced a repressive and undemocratic regime, as the President whom history will acclaim as the liberator of not only her country's government but also of its heartbeat, its spirit. Her people call her Dona Violeta, a name of affection and respect. And as I have come to know her I have understood, for she personifies the blend of resolve and compassion that inspires a nation to become the best it can be. I will tell you something that impresses me. Not only is she working resolutely to bring about tangible reforms expanding democracy and economic opportunity, but she is also embarked on what she terms a quest to restore moral values. What a powerful goal in this age -- the most important goal there is. And under the courageous and idealistic example of President Chamorro, Nicaragua is rediscovering the meaning of its coat of arms, the beautiful symbol embossed in the center of its flag: a triangle for equality, a rainbow for peace, and a shower of light for liberty shining throughout the land, liberty that is embodied by Violeta Chamorro and by her late husband and inspiration, Pedro Joaquin. He used to own a boat named Santa Libertad, glorious liberty. Well, the world now watches as his widow steers her own Santa Libertad, her ship of state, bound for a bright horizon that promises freedom, respect, and dignity for every person in her land. On a shelf in President Chamorro's office is a plaque of a prayer she tries to live by. A prayer that, in fact, reminds me of her. The words are by St. Francis: Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. For it is in giving that we receive, and it is in pardoning that we are pardoned. Dona Violeta, you are an instrument of peace. Through your goals of reconciliation and liberty, you bring vision to your nation, you bring hope to the world. And so, may I ask that we rise and drink to the health -- Madam President, to your health and to that of your proud and courageous land. May God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhestatedinnerforpresidentvioletachamorronicaragua", "title": "Toasts at the State Dinner for President Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-state-dinner-for-president-violeta-chamorro-nicaragua", "publication_date": "17-04-1991", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 787, "text": "IT IS nice to see you all, and it is very, very nice to have you in the White House and in the East Room. I think it is particularly appropriate that we meet here in the East Room to chat for a few minutes about some of our Nation's problems. As I think most of you know, the East Room is very, very rich in history in our National Capital. This famous room is full of happy as well as sad moments in the lives of residents of this house and in this Nation's past. You might be interested to know that the first First Lady in this house was Abigail Adams, who wrote her family of hanging laundry in this room and the problems of the new Federal City. Mrs. Adams sent news to her family of the large and small problems that she faced as First Lady--the same kind of news, I might add, that you in this room share with your readers back home. I have some very fond memories of non-metropolitan weekly and daily newspapers in the Fifth District of Michigan, which was, of course, the district that I had the honor and privilege of representing for over 25 years. During the various Congressional campaigns that I had--13 in all--I advertised very, very heavily, with good results----which I think is a tribute to the impact that all of you in your respective communities has on the people that you represent. I know firsthand that the weekly newspaper or the daily newspaper in a suburban area is the best means of communication, and I have been in many homes in rural areas as wall as in small towns where the paper that came on Thursday or Friday was still good reading material on the following Wednesday. In recent years, the growth in the number of suburban newspapers, I think, reflects the importance of this brand of personal journalism. In an age of mass communications, you are in the business--and fortunately--the business of local communications. It is my judgment, as I expressed a moment ago, that you fill a very important need for your readers--the need to know about the problems of the local community. Although we must recognize--and we do--that the world has grown small and interdependent in many, many ways, the fact remains that the news around the corner and down the street is still mighty important to people all over this great country. We live in a very mobile society, and too many of us, we have been pulled away from our communities. We have been pulled away from the roots of our early youth. Yet, your newspapers put us in touch with our new communities and give us links to our hometowns. I think it is very fortunate that you are a part of the dialog that keeps self-government going--healthy, strong, and very critical in these days. Naturally, I admire your work, but I add very quickly that I need your help. A meaningful discussion of national problems cannot take place only on network television or in large metropolitan newspapers, because these forums do not provide sufficient opportunity for audience response and direct participation. One of the reasons, in my judgment, it is important for me and members of this Administration to travel around our country and to meet in Washington with groups like this one is to listen as well as to talk about the Nation's problems. Perhaps my Congressional background convinced me of the value of face-to-face contact, but there is no substitute for the discussions of ideas in person with community leaders such as yourselves. The best briefing paper in the world cannot explain problems as well as someone who deals with those problems on a very daily and direct basis. Governors or mayors or publishers--you are all equally important. Government officials, I have learned, whether it was in the Congress or in this house, need more talkback from the people that they serve, and that is particularly true of those of us in Washington in the political atmosphere in which we live. This town can be just as parochial as a town of 250 people, and in some respects it is even more so. One of our ways at the White House of getting talkback is the briefing sessions that you have participated in, but another is for you to send your comments, your editorials to Ron Nessen of our Press Office. We need to hear from you, and we need to hear from the readers that all of you serve. We also need your help in describing the problems and the solutions that seem to be the best answer to the problems that we have. But the economic and energy debate underway now must not become simply an exchange of rhetoric, whether it is in the printed media, the electronic media, or just plain talk among people. The debate, as I see it, must produce action. In January, for example, this Administration outlined a comprehensive program to deal with some very harsh realities facing our Nation, both economically and in energy. We made some hard, stern choices in drawing up the Administration plan. I can tell you from personal experience, countless hours working in these two major fields--and we finally culminated all of these hours of many, many people in a program or a plan--the kind of choices that some politicians would rather talk about than make. You deal with deadlines in your business, and I can recall vividly going to many smaller communities in my district on a Wednesday to talk with people in those communities, and I always stopped by the local weekly to chat with the editor. I soon learned that Wednesday was not the time to do it. If I wanted to lose points rather than make them, I did it on a Saturday or on a Monday. As I said, you deal with deadlines, and if those deadlines are not met, then you cannot serve your readers on time. It is my judgment that the Congress must respond to some very real national deadlines. I asked, for example, for action by April 1 on the rebate of 1974 income taxes for individuals as well as for business. There has been much discussion on who should receive the tax rebates--a discussion based too often on purely political considerations. I do not think we can look at this rebate on a political basis. We have to look on how a rebate will affect all Americans. It is sometimes fashionable to talk as if what is good for the American economy is not good for the American people. This tendency to treat the economy as an abstract idea divorced from the lives of the citizens leads to some unfortunate piecemeal proposals. When the economy is sound, it means the people of this Nation are able to live comfortably without fear of inflation and with jobs. To meet the proposed April 1 deadline on the tax cut, which is a program to stimulate the economy to provide jobs, the Senate must act before it recesses March 21, and the House of Representatives before its March 26 Easter recess. The tax cut is only a part of the program that this Administration--that I proposed in January, and there has been more response from Capitol Hill on this proposal than on many others. But as necessary as the tax cut is for the reasons that I have given, it is only a very small piece of the total action that must be taken and taken quickly. It is my judgment that the Congress must act on other parts of this total package, especially in the field of energy. In the State of the Union Address, I called for action in 90 days on a more comprehensive tax program. The first response by the Congress to this plea unfortunately was to negate any action by the President to impose levies on imported oil, and those levies were imposed for the purpose of trying to remove our Nation's vulnerability and to stimulate action by the Congress, but the reaction of the Congress was to attempt to suspend Presidential authority for 90 days. I think many of you know that I vetoed that bill, but I did, in the spirit of compromise, delay the imposition of the added import levies until May 1 to give more time for the Congress to act in committees, on the floor of the House and the Senate, and in the final action in a conference. It is my very serious judgment that the Nation's current economic and energy situation is so critical that the deadline for action cannot be pushed back indefinitely. As you well know, the time comes when there is a final deadline; we in America are approaching that point. Every day of delay by the Congress makes the United States more and more vulnerable to decisions by the foreign oil cartels. There is national agreement on the need for action and the ultimate result. And there is within the spirit of the American people a willingness to accept the hard choices required to regain economic stability and achieve energy independence. In many ways, the President and the American people now wait for the Congress to catch up with us. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, and I quote: In skating over thin ice our safety is our speed. Well, despite the weather outside, the spring thaw is coming, and the Congress must pick up its speed. Thank you for coming today. I am deeply grateful that you are here. And I close with a traditional and heartfelt saying, Let us hear from you. And I must add, I am sure I will.

{"id": 864, "text": "First, I am able to announce two acceptances on the Farm Board Mr. Teague of California, about whom we will give you a note, and Mr. Legge of Chicago. Mr. Legge probably makes as great a sacrifice as any citizen ever made to enter public service. It will reduce the gentleman's salary from something over $100,000 a year to $12,000 a year, as an evidence of his desire to be of service to the American farmer. Mr. Teague likewise makes a very great sacrifice in income. I do not know precisely what his remuneration is as the head of the two largest farmer cooperative associations, but it is certainly far in excess of $12,000 a year. Mr. Legge will be the Chairman of the Board for the first year, and Mr. Stone will undoubtedly be the Vice Chairman. You will recollect that in the selection of an outstanding businessman for the Board we consulted with some 150 farm organizations and found that they were desirous that that should be done, and I further consulted the leaders or had the leaders of numbers of those associations consulted on the question of selecting Mr. Legge, and they were very desirous that he should be secured if possible. We ought to have some more acceptances in the course of a day or two, but that fills five members of the Board out of the eight.1 While talking of sacrifice I should include also the other three members of the Board, who also are making a tremendous sacrifice to come into this Board each one of them. All of the men whom I have invited to come on the Board have considered that here was an opportunity to do probably as great a service as will come to our generation, and that there was no call upon them to which they should not respond. With the exception of Mr. Legge, all of the men so far chosen have been at the direct proposal of farm organizations. I have a question of possible tax reduction. It is always a pleasant subject. We are giving a great deal of study to the possibilities in that direction, and we all hope that a situation may work out on the safe side of a surplus for tax relief. But we must determine three essential things before any conclusion could be arrived at. First, we must know what the effect will be of the legislation during the last 12 months, which has greatly increased the expenditures for the present fiscal year beyond the amount budgeted. The new enlarged program for naval armaments, the increased expenditure for Army and Navy aviation, the rebuilding of the Army posts, increased expenditures to veterans' services, in addition to the necessities for the Mediterranean fly which by the way, may be a considerable item on the farm relief-have all intervened since the budget for the fiscal year that we have just entered was passed by Congress, and we are not yet certain as to what the volume of those expenditures will accumulate to. And we must know how far we can reduce expenditure in the Government in other directions to partly compensate for these increases that have been imposed by the legislation of the last 6 or 8 months. We do know that the expenditure during the past fiscal year just ended exceeded by $200 million the amount budgeted and passed by Congress as the budget. The completion of the budget for the year beginning the first of next July will give us a fairly clearer idea as to what the permanent burdens of the increased legislation may be and again as to what we can save in other directions. And then beyond that on the revenue side, we must have some experience as to whether or not the increase in revenue is due to temporary stock exchange activity or other temporary causes, and then we can come to a final conclusion. All of those things ought to develop during the next 4 or 5 months. By the first of November we ought to be able to see fairly clearly where our commitments and income are likely to land us. I have one announcement to make. I have decided to call a White House conference on the health and protection of children. That conference will be comprised of representatives of the great voluntary associations I have a rough note here, and Miss McGraph will take this, so you do not need to bother taking it together with the Federal and State and municipal authorities who are interested in those problems. The purpose will be to determine the facts as to our present progress and the future needs in this field, and to develop such measures for more effective official and voluntary action and their coordination as will develop further care and protection to children at large. That conference will not be assembled for another 9 months, and perhaps 12 months, in order that there may be time to complete an exhaustive advance study of the facts and forces in progress and of the experience with the different measures which are now in progress over the country, which, as you know, are a very large activity. And in order that we may make an effectual determination of those things, we will set up a series of committees in each special field of the leaders in those fields, with expert assistance. The subjects to be covered embrace such things as the problems of dependent children, of regular medical examination, of school or public clinics for children, hospitalization, adequate milk supplies, community nurses, maternity instruction and nurses, teaching of health in the schools, facilities for playgrounds and recreation, voluntary organizations of children, child labor, and scores of subjects of that character. Now, to cover the expenses not only of the preliminary committees and of the conference but also of the follow-up work that needs to be done for a national effort of that character in order to secure that it results in some definite and positive influence, I have received the sum of $500,000 from purely private sources. This will be the first national conference in review of this subject since the conference called by President Roosevelt in 1909. I propose to include all of the interested groups, amongst them the educational associations so far as they relate to the teaching of health, et cetera, but it is not the purpose of this conference or its work to invade the obligations or the province of parents and their responsibilities. I have communicated with a great number of voluntary associations throughout the country. They are all very anxious that such a conference should be called in order that there might be a new platform and a new basis for more coordinated and renewed effort in those directions. The country the Nation is fundamentally concerned with the equality of opportunity, and the very first step in equal opportunity is health in children. The work of .the conference will be under the direction of Dr.Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, and with the cooperation of Secretary of Labor Mr. Davis. Dr. Harry E. Barnard, who was formerly State Commissioner of Health of Indiana, will be the Executive Secretary. A preliminary committee is in process of assembling, who will lay out the chart of the work and assist in selecting the members of special committees. And that is all that I have today.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference740", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-740", "publication_date": "02-07-1929", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Herbert Hoover"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 702, "text": "We are honored tonight by the visit of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, and His Royal Highness the Prince of the Netherlands. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the fact that we have with us what I like to refer to as the fairy Queen. We had the fairy Princess with us the time before, before she became the Queen of England. We appreciate the fact that our friendship with the Netherlands has been long and lasting. The largest bay on the North American Continent is named for a Dutchman, and his name was Hudson. One of the most beautiful rivers in the country--I say one of the most beautiful, not the most beautiful, necessarily--is named for this same Hendrik Hudson. The Dutch made a great contribution to the settlement of this great Nation of ours, and the Dutch also made a great contribution after we became a great nation, because they were willing to invest their money in this country of ours--and did--for its development. They put on a point 4 program long before I was old enough to know what it meant. They built railroads, ranches, buildings--one of the greatest apartments in this area of Washington was built by Dutch capital. We are grateful for that. We want to show our gratefulness, and we have been trying to show that by the fact that we were--and are--willing to help free Europe recover and meet the world menace east of Poland. We have succeeded, to some extent in getting that done. We have stopped them at every perimeter in which they have made the attempt to make slaves out of their neighbors. We have a different situation here on this western continent. The United States is credited with being at this time one of the strongest nations in the history of the world. It has neighbors on the south. It has neighbors on the north. Those neighbors are not afraid of us. They do not think we are going to try to take them over, or make them colonies, or make them a part of our own territory. They are cooperative neighbors. We hope to see the whole world set up on that basis someday--and I think we will. And one of the great assets in our efforts to get that done is the great country that these lovely people represent. I am glad they are here. I hope they will enjoy themselves. I hope they will take back a good opinion of this Nation of ours, and that when they go home they will feel more friendly to us than when they came--if that is possible.

{"id": 571, "text": "Thank you all very much. Please be seated. Welcome to the Rose Garden. I told you not to tell the Elvis story. She told it anyway, did not she? Every President since Harry Truman has presented this award, Teacher of the Year Award. And there is a good reason for that. When you are in the company of some of the Nation's finest citizens, our greatest teachers, you are in the company of people who give their hearts and their careers to improving the lives of children. You are in the company of the best of our country. I want to congratulate the teachers who are here from around the country. It is a great experience for Laura and me to greet you in the Oval Office. I guess the word I would describe the teachers as they came through is, they are joyous people. There is such a joy that radiates on your face and in your character. And on behalf of our Nation, I want to thank you for what you do. You make a great contribution. In spite of the fact that she told the Elvis story, the best decision I made was to marry a teacher. Laura is a great First Lady for our country, and I am really proud of her. Besides the distinguished teachers who are here, I see we have got some other distinguished citizens with us today. Gene Hickok is the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Education. Thank you for coming, Gene. I am glad you are here. From the great State of Kansas, Senator Brownback and Congressman Dennis Moore-I am honored you both are here. Thanks for coming. I appreciate the fact that Lindsey Graham from South Carolina is here and Congressman Gresham Barrett. Thank you both for coming. I see Maria Cantwell, Senator from the State of Washington, is with us today and Congressman George Nethercutt-appreciate you all being here. I appreciate so very much the Governor of the great State of Rhode Island, and the first lady, Sue, is with us. Thank you both for being here today-honored you took time to come. I am confident our honoree is really pleased you are here. I appreciate the fact that Senator Chafee-Senator Linc Chafee and Senator Jack Reed have joined us. Thank you for coming. And Congressman Jim Langevin is with us as well. Good to see you, friend. I am glad you are back. I also, too, want to congratulate the National Teacher of the Year finalists: Keil Hileman from DeSoto, Kansas; Jason Fulmer from Graniteville, South Carolina- you have been there, have not you, Senator?- that is good--Dennis Griner from Palouse, Washington; and of course, our honoree, Kathy Mellor. I also want to congratulate Kathy's family, Duke and her three children who have joined us today. I know there are some friends here with Kathy. Chris Sirr is with Kathy. She came all the way over, and I know there is other friends as well, and I am honored that they would take time out of their lives to support their friend and honor their buddy in what is an important moment for our Nation, as we honor those who dedicate their lives to teaching. I want to thank Tom Houlihan, who is the executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers. Ernie Fleishman, the senior vice president of education of Scholastic, Inc., thank you for being here. I want to thank the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc., for organizing this program. I also want to thank Peter McWalters, who is the chief state school officer of Rhode Island. Welcome, everybody. Thanks for coming. It is fitting we have this annual ceremony because teachers are charged with a great mission. You do the vital work of teaching our children. You give them the skills that will help them succeed. You lay the foundation for realizing the American Dream. You do more than that, though. You kindle imaginations. You foster a love for learning that can last a lifetime. What a fantastic gift to give a child. The best teachers treat every child with dignity and fairness and insist that their students treat others the same way. And through your encouragement and caring, you teach the students to respect themselves. To a child, it is a special feeling when a teacher knows your name and asks your opinion, cares what you think and gives you encouragement. For some students, unfortunately, you might be the only person who does that. Anyone who has visited the classroom can see that teaching demands poise and warmth and, oftentimes, extraordinary patience, as my fourth grade teacher had to show. Yet, only the family members of teachers know some of the other traits that define great teachers. They have seen you stay up late rewriting lesson plans. They have seen you seek new ways to advance your skills. They have seen you somehow summon the energy to make an after-school game or a play. For you, teaching is not just a profession; it is a calling you have answered. And we thank you for that. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We ask a lot from our teachers, and you are right to expect a lot from society. I oftentimes say to people that if you are interested in being a responsible citizen and you are worried about the quality of the education in the community in which you live, do something about it. Support your schools. Support your teachers. Make a difference. As opposed to sitting on the outside complaining, get involved, help people search for excellence. State government has got a responsibility as well. I used to say when I was Governor of Texas, education is to a State what defense is to the National Government. It is the most important priority. If people are worried about the quality of the education in the State in which they live, get your Governors to make education the number one priority of the State. And finally, the Federal Government has got a role to play as well. We have increased spending here by 43 percent. The next budget will make it 50 percent over the past 4 years. In other words, there is a role for the Federal Government. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, we are making sure that Federal money actually goes to help students learn. I love the spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act, by the way. It is what I call challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations. You see, the reason you are Teachers of the Year is because you set high expectations. You know in your heart of hearts every child can learn. You are willing to raise that bar, to set high standards. I appreciate so very much the willingness for teachers also to use the accountability systems to determine whether or not what you are doing is working. It is a vital part of making sure that no child gets left behind. But make no mistake about it, we understand here in Washington that the people who really make student achievement possible are the good-hearted teachers who work hard every single day to make sure that no child is left behind. And that is why we honor you here in the Rose Garden. Our 2004 National Teacher of the Year is Kathy Mellor. She embodies the qualities that all students and parents hope for in a teacher. For nearly 20 years, Ms. Mellor has taught English as a second language in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Kathy redesigned her district's ESL program to better integrate students with their English-speaking classmates, and the educational benefits of her innovation have been clear. As the parent of one of Mrs. Mellor's students wrote, My daughter's English improved unbelievably that year. Gosh, that must be the best words a teacher can hear: My daughter's English improved unbelievably that year. At the end of the year, she was able to finish her regular class assignments. The mom said, she is able to do so alone or with a little help from her. Ms. Mellor's creative approach extends well beyond the classroom. She applied for and received a grant to teach English to the mothers of her ESL students. What a great gift. What a caring soul. Working with two colleagues, Ms. Mellor taught a group of women for 2 1/2 years. At the end of the program, the women's language skills and personal confidence were both vastly improved, and many went on to further education and to new jobs. Ms. Mellor's 19 years in North Kingstown has earned her the reputation for creativity and caring and consistent success. She is humble and generous, always willing to share credit with others and committed to serving as a mentor to every colleague. Because she understands the importance of her work, her energy and her spirit have never waned. As Kathy put it, After many years, I still look forward to Monday mornings. Working with this diverse community of learners and their supportive families is one of the most rewarding things I have ever done or ever could do. No wonder she is Teacher of the Year. Every teacher here has chosen a rewarding and optimistic profession. And the families of America are glad that people like you show up every Monday morning. I thank each of you for your skill and dedication. I thank you for being an integral part of making sure America is a hopeful and optimistic country for all.

{"id": 1055, "text": "Hello, everybody. Before I discuss the meeting that I have just had with Prime Minister Maliki, I just want to make a brief statement about Afghanistan. I had the opportunity to speak with President Karzai this morning, and I wanted to congratulate him on accepting the certification of the recent election. As we all know, this has been a very difficult time in Afghanistan, to not only carry out a election under difficult circumstances, where there were a whole host of security issues that had to be resolved, but also postelection, a lot of uncertainty. President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done. And so I expressed the American people's appreciation for this step. As I mentioned before, this has been a difficult election. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in Afghanistan. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the IEC and the ECC in Afghanistan complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process. I also want to commend Senator John Kerry, who was in the region traveling and ended up working extensively with Ambassador Eikenberry and was extraordinarily constructive and very helpful. So I think he deserves great congratulations. Moving forward, we will continue to work with our ISAF partners as well as the Afghan Government, however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the Afghan that we can move Afghanistan towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the Afghan people is ultimately done. So we are pleased with the steps that have been taken today, and we hope that we can build on this progress. I finally want to thank the incredible work of our U.S. military and the young men and women who are stationed in Afghanistan who are doing so much to help bring about a more secure and prosperous and democratic Afghanistan. I am grateful to have the opportunity to see Prime Minister Maliki once again. We had a wide-ranging discussion about the continuing progress that Iraq is making. We have seen in the last several months a consolidation of a commitment to democratic politics inside of Iraq. We are very interested, both of us, in making sure that Iraq has an election law that is completed on time so that elections can take place on time in January. That is consistent with the transition that has been taking place, and I reemphasized my commitment to Prime Minister Maliki that we will have our combat troops out of Iraq by August of next year and all of our troops out of Iraq by 2011. But we did not just talk about military and security issues. What is wonderful about this trip is that it represents a transition in our bilateral relationship, so that we are moving now to issues beyond security and we are beginning to talk about economy, trade, commerce. The business and investment conference that is taking place is going to be very well attended. It includes not only Prime Minister Maliki but business leaders from both the United States and Iraq. We have seen over the last several months progress being made on providing clarification about investment laws inside of Iraq. There are, obviously, enormous opportunities for our countries to do business together. And so I just want to congratulate Prime Minister Maliki on what I am confident will be a successful conference and to reemphasize my administration's full support for all the steps that can be taken so that Iraq can not only be a secure place and a democratic country but also a place where people can do business, people can find work, families can make a living, and children are well educated. And that broader sense of a U.S. relationship with a democratic Iraq is one that I think all of us are confident we can now achieve. So thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister, for your presence here today. And I do not know if you maybe we could translate the last part just about Iraq, as opposed to Afghanistan, just in case there is some Prime Minister Maliki. Thank you, ENTITY, and this opportunity to hold the business investment conference is a big economic demonstration and manifestation of the importance of this event that brings together more than 1,000 business entrepreneurs and a very distinguished, high-level Iraqi delegation. I have also discussed with ENTITY the various issues and the fact that our relations today have moved along and not only confined to the security cooperation but today have moved to the economic development and to providing prosperity for the Iraqi people. We have discussed the issues of common interest to our bilateral relations under the that are today framed under the strategic framework agreement and the various sectors, and all this is important for broader relation of our two nations. We have also discussed the issue of the elections and the importance that these elections be held on time based on the national principles. We have also commented on the role of the United States that supports Iraq and the importance to end the international sanctions on Iraq and to remove Iraq from under chapter 7, because we do not have weapons of mass destructions anymore, and today, that we have put forth a lot of common sacrifices, and today, that there is a pluralistic political system in Iraq. This is important to move Iraq forward and to promote investments. We will follow up on the outcome of the business investment conference in its various sectors because today, Iraq has moved beyond a dictatorship and beyond the destruction, and we are trying to rebuild all our sectors of agriculture, oil sectors, tourism, and so forth. We want to give the U.S. companies an opportunity to be present in investing in Iraq, and all this cooperation on the basis of the strategic framework agreement. I thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministernurialmalikiiraq", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of Iraq", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-nuri-al-maliki-iraq", "publication_date": "20-10-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 656, "text": "Thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, President Bush, President Carter, President Ford, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to acknowledge just a couple of other people who are in the audience because I think they deserve to be seen by America since you will be seeing a lot more of them: my good friend Bill Daley from Chicago and former Congressman Bill Frenzel from Minnesota, who have agreed to lead this fight for our administration on a bipartisan basis. Would you please stand and be recognized. It is an honor for me today to be joined by my predecessor, President Bush, who took the major steps in negotiating this North American Free Trade Agreement; President Jimmy Carter, whose vision of hemispheric development gives great energy to our efforts and has been a consistent theme of his for many, many years now; and President Ford, who has argued as fiercely for expanded trade and for this agreement as any American citizen and whose counsel I continue to value. These men, differing in party and outlook, join us today because we all recognize the important stakes for our Nation in this issue. Yesterday we saw the sight of an old world dying, a new one being born in hope and a spirit of peace. Peoples who for a decade were caught in the cycle of war and frustration chose hope over fear and took a great risk to make the future better. Today we turn to face the challenge of our own hemisphere, our own country, our own economic fortunes. In a few moments, I will sign three agreements that will complete our negotiations with Mexico and Canada to create a North American Free Trade Agreement. In the coming months I will submit this pact to Congress for approval. It will be a hard fight, and I expect to be there with all of you every step of the way. We will make our case as hard and as well as we can. And though the fight will be difficult, I deeply believe we will win. And I'd like to tell you why. First of all, because NAFTA means jobs, American jobs and good-paying American jobs. If I did not believe that, I would not support this agreement. As President, it is my duty to speak frankly to the American people about the world in which we now live. Fifty years ago at the end of World War II, an unchallenged America was protected by the oceans and by our technological superiority and, very frankly, by the economic devastation of the people who could otherwise have been our competitors. We chose then to try to help rebuild our former enemies and to create a world of free trade supported by institutions which would facilitate it. As a result of that effort, global trade grew from $200 billion in 1950 to $800 billion in 1980. As a result, jobs were created and opportunity thrived all across the world. But make no mistake about it, our decision at the end of World War II to create a system of global, expanded, freer trade, and the supporting institutions, played a major role in creating the prosperity of the American middle class. Ours is now an era in which commerce is global and in which money, management, technology are highly mobile. For the last 20 years, in all the wealthy countries of the world, because of changes in the global environment, because of the growth of technology, because of increasing competition, the middle class that was created and enlarged by the wise policies of expanding trade at the end of World War II has been under severe stress. Most Americans are working harder for less. They are vulnerable to the fear tactics and the averseness to change that is behind much of the opposition to NAFTA. But I want to say to my fellow Americans, when you live in a time of change the only way to recover your security and to broaden your horizons is to adapt to the change, to embrace it, to move forward. Nothing we do, nothing we do in this great capital can change the fact that factories or information can flash across the world, that people can move money around in the blink of an eye. Nothing can change the fact that technology can be adopted, once created, by people all across the world and then rapidly adapted in new and different ways by people who have a little different take on the way the technology works. For two decades, the winds of global competition have made these things clear to any American with eyes to see. The only way we can recover the fortunes of the middle class in this country so that people who work harder and smarter can at least prosper more, the only way we can pass on the American dream of the last 40 years to our children and their children for the next 40 is to adapt to the changes which are occurring. In a fundamental sense, this debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday. I tell you, my fellow Americans, that if we learned anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the governments in Eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot resist the winds of change that economics and technology and information flow have imposed in this world of ours. That is not an option. Our only realistic option is to embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow. I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the first 2 years of its effect. I believe if you look at the trends-and President Bush and I were talking about it this morning-starting about the time he was elected President, over one-third of our economic growth and in some years over one-half of our net new jobs came directly from exports. And on average, those exports-related jobs paid much higher than jobs that had no connection to exports. I believe that NAFTA will create a million jobs in the first 5 years of its impact. And I believe that that is many more jobs than will be lost, as inevitably some will be, as always happens when you open up the mix to a new range of competition. NAFTA will generate these jobs by fostering an export boom to Mexico, by tearing down tariff walls which have been lowered quite a bit by the present administration of President Salinas but are still higher than Americas'. Already Mexican consumers buy more per capita from the United States than other consumers in other nations. Most Americans do not know this, but the average Mexican citizen, even though wages are much lower in Mexico, the average Mexican citizen is now spending $450 per year per person to buy American goods. That is more than the average Japanese, the average German, or the average Canadian buys; more than the average German, Swiss, and Italian citizens put together. So when people say that this trade agreement is just about how to move jobs to Mexico so nobody can make a living, how do they explain the fact that Mexicans keep buying more products made in America every year? Go out and tell the American people that. Mexican citizens with lower incomes spend more money-real dollars, not percentage of their income-more money on American products than Germans, Japanese, Canadians. That is a fact. And there will be more if they have more money to spend. That is what expanding trade is all about. In 1987, Mexico exported $5.7 billion more of products to the United States than they purchased from us. We had a trade deficit. Because of the free market, tariff-lowering policies of the Salinas government in Mexico, and because our people are becoming more export-oriented, that $5.7 billion trade deficit has been turned into a $5.4 billion trade surplus for the United States. It has created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Even when you subtract the jobs that have moved into the maquilladora areas, America is a net job winner in what has happened in trade in the last 6 years. When Mexico boosts its consumption of petroleum products in Louisiana-where we are going tomorrow to talk about NAFTA-as it did by about 200 percent in that period, Louisiana refinery workers gained job security. When Mexico purchased industrial machinery and computer equipment made in Illinois, that means more jobs. And guess what? In this same period, Mexico increased those purchases out of Illinois by 300 percent. Forty-eight out of the 50 States have boosted exports to Mexico since 1987. That is one reason why 41 of our Nation's 50 Governors-some of them who are here today, and I thank them for their presence-support this trade pact. I can tell you, if you are a Governor, people will not leave you in office unless they think you get up every day trying to create more jobs. They think that is what your job is if you are a Governor. And the people who have the job of creating jobs for their State and working with their business community, working with their labor community, 41 out of the 50 have already embraced the NAFTA pact. Many Americans are still worried that this agreement will move jobs south of the border because they have seen jobs move south of the border and because they know that there are still great differences in the wage rates. There have been 19 serious economic studies of NAFTA by liberals and conservatives alike; 18 of them have concluded that there will be no job loss. Businesses do not choose to locate based solely on wages. If they did, Haiti and Bangladesh would have the largest number of manufacturing jobs in the world. Businesses do choose to locate based on the skills and productivity of the work force, the attitude of the government, the roads and railroads to deliver products, the availability of a market close enough to make the transportation costs meaningful, the communications networks necessary to support the enterprise. That is our strength, and it will continue to be our strength. As it becomes Mexico's strength and they generate more jobs, they will have higher incomes, and they will buy more American products. We can win this. This is not a time for defeatism. It is a time to look at an opportunity that is enormous. Moreover, there are specific provisions in this agreement that remove some of the current incentives for people to move their jobs just across our border. For example, today Mexican law requires United States automakers who want to sell cars to Mexicans to build them in Mexico. This year we will export only 1,000 cars to Mexico. Under NAFTA, the Big Three automakers expect to ship 60,000 cars to Mexico in the first year alone, and that is one reason why one of the automakers recently announced moving 1,000 jobs from Mexico back to Michigan. In a few moments, I will sign side agreements to NAFTA that will make it harder than it is today for businesses to relocate solely because of very low wages or lax environmental rules. These side agreements will make a difference. The environmental agreement will, for the first time ever, apply trade sanctions against any of the countries that fails to enforce its own environmental laws. I might say to those who say that is a giving up of our sovereignty: For people who have been asking us to ask that of Mexico, how do we have the right to ask that of Mexico if we do not demand it of ourselves? It is nothing but fair. This is the first time that there have ever been trade sanctions in the environmental law area. This ground-breaking agreement is one of the reasons why major environmental groups, ranging from the Audubon Society to the Natural Resources Defense Council, are supporting NAFTA. The second agreement ensures that Mexico enforces its laws in areas that include worker health and safety, child labor, and the minimum wage. And I might say, this is the first time in the history of world trade agreements when any nation has ever been willing to tie its minimum wage to the growth in its own economy. What does that mean? It means that there will be an even more rapid closing of the gap between our two wage rates. And as the benefits of economic growth are spread in Mexico to working people, what will happen? They will have more disposable income to buy more American products, and there will be less illegal immigration because more Mexicans will be able to support their children by staying home. This is a very important thing. The third agreement answers one of the primary attacks on NAFTA that I heard for a year, which is, Well, you can say all this, but something might happen that you cannot foresee. Well, that is a good thing, otherwise we never would have had yesterday. I mean, I plead guilty to that. Something might happen that Carla Hills did not foresee, or George Bush did not foresee, or Mickey Kantor or Bill Clinton did not foresee. That is true. Now, the third agreement protects our industries against unforeseen surges in exports from either one of our trading partners. And the flip side is also true. Economic change, as I said before, has often been cruel to the middle class, but we have to make change their friend. NAFTA will help to do that. This imposes also a new obligation on our Government, and I am glad to see so many Members of Congress from both parties here today. We do have some obligations here. We have to make sure that our workers are the best prepared, the best trained in the world. Without regard to NAFTA, we know now that the average 18-year-old American will change jobs eight times in a lifetime. The Secretary of Labor has told us, without regard to NAFTA, that over the last 10 years, for the first time, when people lose their jobs most of them do not go back to their old job; they go back to a different job. So that we no longer need an unemployment system, we need a reemployment system. And we have to create that. And that is our job. We have to tell American workers who will be dislocated because of this agreement, or because of things that will happen regardless of this agreement, that we are going to have a reemployment program for training in America. And we intend to do that. Together, the efforts of two administrations now have created a trade agreement that moves beyond the traditional notions of free trade, seeking to ensure trade that pulls everybody up instead of dragging some down while others go up. We have put the environment at the center of this in future agreements. We have sought to avoid a debilitating contest for business where countries seek to lure them only by slashing wages or despoiling the environment. This agreement will create jobs, thanks to trade with our neighbors. That is reason enough to support it. But I must close with a couple of other points. NAFTA is essential to our longterm ability to compete with Asia and Europe. Across the globe our competitors are consolidating, creating huge trading blocs. This pact will create a free trade zone stretching from the Arctic to the tropics, the largest in the world, a $6.5 billion market with 370 million people. It will help our businesses to be both more efficient and to better compete with our rivals in other parts of the world. This is also essential to our leadership in this hemisphere and the world. Having won the cold war, we face the more subtle challenge of consolidating the victory of democracy and opportunity and freedom. For decades, we have preached and preached and preached greater democracy, greater respect for human rights, and more open markets to Latin America. NAFTA finally offers them the opportunity to reap the benefits of this. Secretary Shalala represented me recently at the installation of the President of Paraguay. And she talked to Presidents from Colombia, from Chile, from Venezuela, from Uruguay, from Argentina, from Brazil. They all wanted to know, Tell me, is NAFTA going to pass so we can become part of this great new market-more, hundreds of millions more of American consumers for our products. It is no secret that there is division within both the Democratic and Republican Parties on this issue. That often happens in a time of great change. I just want to say something about this because it is very important. Are you guys resting? I am going to sit down when you talk, so I am glad you got to do it. I am very grateful to the Presidents for coming here, because there is division in the Democratic Party and there is division in the Republican Party. That is because this fight is not a traditional fight between Democrats and Republicans and liberals and conservatives. It is right at the center of the effort that we are making in America to define what the future is going to be about. And so there are differences. But if you strip away the differences, it is clear that most of the people that oppose this pact are rooted in the fears and insecurities that are legitimately gripping the great American middle class. It is no use to deny that these fears and insecurities exist. It is no use denying that many of our people have lost in the battle for change. But it is a great mistake to think that NAFTA will make it worse. Every single solitary thing you hear people talk about, that they are worried about, can happen whether this trade agreement passes or not, and most of them will be made worse if it fails. And I can tell you it will be better if it passes. So I say this to you: Are we going to compete and win, or are we going to withdraw? Are we going to face the future with confidence that we can create tomorrow's jobs, or are we going to try against all the evidence of the last 20 years to hold on to yesterday's? Are we going to take the plain evidence of the good faith of Mexico in opening their own markets and buying more of our products and creating more of our jobs, or are we going to give in to the fears of the worst-case scenario? Are we going to pretend that we do not have the first trade agreement in history dealing seriously with labor standards, environmental standards, and cleverly and clearly taking account of unforeseen consequences, or are we going to say this is the best you can do and then some? In an imperfect world, we have something which will enable us to go forward together and to create a future that is worthy of our children and grandchildren, worthy of the legacy of America, and consistent with what we did at the end of World War II. We have to do that again. We have to create a new world economy. And if we do not do it, we cannot then point the finger at Europe and Japan or anybody else and say, Why do not you pass the GATT agreement; why do not you help to create a world economy? If we walk away from this, we have no right to say to other countries in the world, You are not fulfilling your world leadership; you are not being fair with us. This is our opportunity to provide an impetus to freedom and democracy in Latin America and create new jobs for America as well. It is a good deal, and we ought to take it.

{"id": 948, "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. What an honor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. We love this section of the world. It is a beautiful section. We appreciate it very much, and I am thrilled to be back in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, so much. Thank you. This is the state where the story of American independence began. It is the state where the American constitution was signed. Think of that. And three days from now, this is the state that will save the American dream. On November 3rd, we are going to win Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful White House. We gather today in a very special place. In the harrowing days of December 1776, when the American revolution seemed lost, General George Washington made his headquarters as this Bucks County farmhouse to plan his famous crossing of the Delaware. On Christmas night, he led what remained, and just very little remained, of that rag tag continental army on a daring midnight raid. It was a tough night, it was a violent night. They marched through nine miles of ice and snow, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in their wake. At dawn, they seized victory at Trenton. Their sacrifice turned the entire tide of the war. Those soldiers came from every walk of life, but what united them all was their devotion to the principle of self-government. They were determined to live in a country where power belongs to the people. That priceless inheritance is at stake just three days from now, and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you are there, as sure as we are here together, and they see it. They see it at all sides, and there is not a thing they can do about it. This is the fundamental question facing every voter in American. Do you want to be a nation ruled by the corrupt political class, or do you want to be governed by the American people? I ran for office four years ago because I could not sit by and watch any longer as a small group of Washington insiders continued to get rich bleeding America dry. They are just bleeding America dry. Think of it. Closing our factories, opening our borders, outsourcing our industries, and letting foreign countries ravage our middle class. Career politicians spend trillions of dollars fighting foreign wars, while letting our own cities crumble and decay. Here in Pennsylvania, you know this bitter and very painful betrayal all too well. Better than most. The corrupt Washington class launched an economic war against this state. For decades, they targeted your steel mills, shut down your plants, and sent millions of your jobs overseas, all while lining their pockets with special interest cash, and no one embodies this betrayal and treachery more than Joe Biden. And worst of all, the suppressed media and big tech refuses to cover the crime. They refuse to cover. We have learnt so much over the last two weeks. For 47 years, he supported every disastrous trade deal that enriched his cronies and impoverished your state. He wiped out Pennsylvania Steel. He was the cheerleader of NAFTA, and China's entry into the World Trade organization. Pennsylvania lost 50% of your manufacturing jobs after those Biden disastrous. Then Biden pushed the job killing Paris Climate Accord, an economic nightmare for Pennsylvania miners and every worker in our country. He backed TPP, which would have extinguished the American auto industry forever. Forever. These betrayals not only made Biden's donors rich, they made his family rich, and as we know, he profited from the misery of unleashed work and horror given to Pennsylvania workers. He made a lot of money, his family made a lot of money, and nobody knew about it until just recently. At the debate, I looked at him and said, Joe, you were here for 47 years, and you left only three and a half years ago. Why did not you do these things that you want done? Why did not you fix it, Joe? And as you know, because I assume a number of you watched the debate but as you know, he just looked at me and shrugged. In fact, the anchor looked up and said, Why did you do it? She could not believe it, and she was on his side. She said, Why did you do it? Why did you do it and why did you say it? In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and corrupt political establishment, and you voted for an outsider's president who is finally putting America first. And if I do not look like a typical politician, that is very simple. It is because I am not a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it is because I was elected to fight for you, and I fought harder for you than any president in the history of our country. From day one, Washington insiders have been trying to stop me because they do not own me and they do not control me. They want control. They do not like what I am doing. They do not like what I have said to the big pharma, the drug companies, the number one lobbyist in the world, number one lobbyist in our country. They did not like that I instituted Favored Nation so that we now pay the lowest prices in the world for prescription drugs, instead of the highest prices in the world. If these corrupt forces succeed in electing Joe Biden, Washington will see to it that another outsider never becomes president again. It will never happen again, and nobody has done in three and a half years, nobody, no administration, no president, what we have done and what we have accomplished, and it is not even challenged. Nobody even challenges that. They will take back control and they will never, ever give it up. This once in a lifetime opportunity to beat the corrupt politicians will be lost forever, and they know it. They are fighting so hard and they hate what they are seeing because they are not looking at fake suppression polls anymore. Now they are looking at the numbers that are pouring in, and they do not like the numbers that they are seeing in Florida and in Ohio and in North Carolina. And we think in Pennsylvania, although those numbers come in late. We think in Pennsylvania. They do not like it. They do not like it, they do not like what they see, and I just want to tell you that we have really, things have worked out so well for our country. Nobody had any idea that anything like this could ever happen. If you look at what is going on over the last four years, we have been building the biggest, strongest, and most secure middle class in human history. We built the most powerful military anywhere in the world. And over the next four years, we will make it even stronger. Stronger like nobody thought even possible. Do not be intimidated by our opponents' angry and menacing tone, because if we were, we would never have been able to accomplish what we have accomplished. In truth, they are actually terrified of you, the people. They are terrified. They are terrified that you will discover that you have the power to end their corrupt rule once and for all. We have to do it. When you see what is going on, we have to do it. We do not have a choice. Somebody said, Do you enjoy this? I said, It is not a question of enjoyment. Believe it or not I do. I should not . Have to go check something, but I should not . But you know, today we are doing three rallies, tomorrow we are doing five, and the smallest crowd will be 25,000 people. Then on Monday we are doing five or six, and I cannot tell you what is going to happen there, but I think we will just go home and rest. But they do not get to decide this election. This is your choice. We have to be very careful. We have to be very, very careful, especially in this state, more than any other state. They say you have to be very, very careful. What happens in Philadelphia, we have to be extremely, everybody has to watch, vigilant. Your decision, your future is at stake. As your president, I do not answer to the special interests. I have no interest in it. I do not take instructions from donors and lobbyists. I do not care about them. I do not care about them. I do not take my orders from the media, or as I affectionately call them, the fake news media. And as you know, they have turned out to be far more fake than we ever thought, and they have really turned out to be corrupt. They are corrupt. They are really corrupt. The word fake is not strong enough, especially after what we have seen where stories, major stories, the biggest story anywhere in the world, is absolutely not covered. It is hard to have scandal when you have no coverage, and they work in conjunction with big tech, and they protect each other, and they protect the democrats, because with the democrats, you do not have somebody up talking like I do about them, so they can do whatever they want, and this will only lead to very bad things. I do what is right for America. I do what is right for America. It is made me a lot of enemies in Washington but I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Winston Churchill once said that it was a nation that had the lion heart. I had the luck to give it the roar. I gave it the roar, and there is a roar, and people hear it all over. They heard it four years ago loud and clear. Probably the biggest thing to happen. They talk Brexit, they talk many numerous things, but this is always number one. What happened, 2016? And I will say, 2016 was an incredible earth shaking event, but 2020, and I never thought I'd say this, 2020, what we are doing right now through Tuesday, what we are doing is far bigger. It is far bigger. I never thought I'd say it. I never thought four years ago, and you never did either, somebody would say that this is going to be the most important election perhaps in the history of our country. It is really amazing. The greatest threat to American democracy is the concentration of power among a small group of unelected special interests. The big tech CEOs who have been put in a position by us giving a law to them, Section 230. We have given them that power, and you know that can be taken away. That can be taken away, and probably has to be taken away. I see it better than all. I see it so obviously. I see it because of what I do on social media. For me, it is very easy to see. I see things that nobody would believe. The corporate media and the mega donors in Washington and Silicon Valley, they are all lining up behind an opponent that is going to do whatever they tell him to do. That sleepy Joe Biden. He could've been the greatest. You know, if you look, we look at the amount of money that he has raised. Hundreds of millions. 300 million dollars one month. But I could've been the greatest of all time. I could've been the greatest political fundraiser, because as president all I had to do was call Wall Street, the big banks. I could've called the oil companies, I could've called all of the big companies. Every single one of them, and I know many of them would've given me whatever I wanted, but I chose not to do that, and we did plenty. We have plenty. You can only buy so many commercials. When the air waves are full and you cannot buy anymore, I say, Where are we going to spend it? Although we did spend in our case a lot on ground game, which they, I think, forgot this part. As much money as they have, they are screaming in Florida, Where is our ground game? Where is our ground ? Well, it takes a long time. You know what? It took us a year and a half to build that ground game, so we will see how it all works out, but they did not do that. They decided to go a different route, but they took in massive amounts of money. I could've taken in much more than that. They did 350. I could've done that within an hour. The president is calling. He'd like you to send 25 million dollars, please. Who is going to tell me no? Nobody. But the problem is, the problem is when they call in six months needing a favor that is worth billions, it is very hard, especially me being a loyal person, not a dishonest person, but a loyal person, it is very hard for me to say, No, I do not want to take his call, his or her call, no, I do not want to do it. Really, you are compromised. It would've compromised our nation, so I did not want to do that. Joe Biden works for them. I know them very well. I know them far better than he does. I know him far better than he. Some are friends. Some are actually very surprised when I say, You do not have to bother, do not worry. I do not think we can buy anymore anyway, right? But he works for them, and when you see those numbers, 300, 350 million, so much they do not know what to do with it, where they are spending 25, 30 million dollars on a congressional race that used to spend 500,000 dollars, you know something's going on, and it is not a good thing, and it is not the way I want to work. This was one opportunity to do something special. This is not a company, this is not making some money. This is one opportunity to turn our country around, and we are not going to blow it. He works for them. Not for you, and it is I who work for you. I am working for you. It is like, not used to that, too much, but I have gotten used to it, and we have this great opportunity together, and our people tend to vote, in particular this state, you tend to vote on the 3rd. I could say, Go in and early vote, do not wait til Tuesday, vote today, vote tomorrow, vote on Monday. But I am wasting a lot of time, because you want to go. It is tradition, it is habit. It is the history of this state. Look at what you have done with this state. Look at the history of this state with respect to our country, and you want to go, I will not even say go today, go tomorrow, go the next day, or go on the 3rd. We want election day. Thank you. Election day. And we have others like that, too. We have others like that, too. They want election day. It is going to be a great day. The more these corrupt forces oppose me the more I know we are delivering real change, real progress, and historic victories for the American people. We have done great things with the country including our military, our vets. The biggest tax and regulation cuts in history. We just received a poll, this was a real poll, not a suppression poll, where the vets gave us a 91% approval rating for the job that we are doing. Think of that. 91%. The highest ever. Over these last four years, we have been building the strongest and most secure middle class in- we have been building the strongest and most secure middle class in human history. We have built the most powerful military in the world by far. Nobody has ever built what we have built. And when I came in, we had a depleted military. We had old planes. We used to get parts by going to the airplane graveyards and taking the old parts out of old planes that were sitting there rusting of the sun. And crazy weather where they store them in the deserts. And that is what we were doing. We had a depleted, a terribly depleted military. And now we have the best equipment anywhere in the world by far, all made in the U.S.A. And as I say, we are the envy of every world, we are the envy of every world power, from China to Russia, North Korea. They look at us and they say, Wow, what they have done? New jets, new fighter jets, bombers, tanks, missiles, rockets, nuclear. And just hope to God that we never have to use it. Hope to God we never have to use it. But it is less likely that we will ever have to use it when we have it. Okay, when we have it. We were in very bad shape militarily, a general came to see me, highly overrated general came to see me actually, one of the world's most overrated generals. And he said, Sir, we have no ammunition. Right at the beginning, you know what I am talking about because we could have had conflict. He said, Sir, could you hold it off? We have no ammunition. And I said, General, no president should ever hear that statement again. We have no ammunition. Well, now we have so much ammunition. Our problem is, we have no storage. And over the next four years, we will make it even stronger, going to keep us safe. Last night, our brave special forces rescued at American hostage in a far away country. They are incredible people. And I was in Fort Bragg yesterday and I met a lot of the incredible, these incredible, talented, strong, both physically and mentally, the strongest, the best in the world. But we had a mission sent to a far away land where they kidnapped an American citizen. And the kidnappers wished they had never done it. And they went in with a large group, zero casualties. We got our American citizen, young man, we got our young man back. But the other side suffered gravely, I can tell you that. Our nation salutes its courageous military, which brilliantly executed this operation. Very few people would have been able to do it. It was very complicated and a very complex, tough area. We celebrate the safe return home of an American hostage. We have got many hostages home. And I pay nothing, nothing, cannot pay. Once you pay, you will have many, many more. We are 40 Robert O'Brien who is doing a tremendous job said to me, Sir, you are 48 and 0. 48 and O, think of that, we have brought many, many of them home. Some mostly in pretty good shape, some in very, very, bad shape. Specifically, you know who I am talking about. Came home in very bad shape. But sometimes that happens too. But we have brought many home, but we do not pay. You pay, once you pay, your numbers will go up a thousand fold. We are boldly standing up to China. We achieved the most secure border in American history, our Southern border. We have obtained in just a short period of time, American energy independence. And if it were up to the opposing side, with the Green New Deal, the Green New Dealers. AOC plus three and you add Pelosi and Schumer, and you add Joe Biden, who really does not understand so. They will tell him what to do and he will do whatever they tell them, whatever it takes, he will say whatever it takes. With the sunglass-, I saw the sunglasses. I said, I do not think I am going to do that. But I watched those sunglasses. I do not know, to me it did not work. We are bringing our jobs, our factories, our wealth, and our troops all back home. They are all coming home. They are all coming home. And instead of endless wars in countries that even you very sophisticated people in some cases have never even heard of, we are achieving one historic peace after another, if you look. Middle East, we already have three signed up. We have many countries who want to sign, we are signing them rapidly. And even with Kosovo and Serbia, we are doing a trade deal with each, a routine trade deal. When I heard about it, I said, Wait a minute, they have been killing for decades. They have been killing and killing for decades each other, fighting all the time. We are doing a trade deal, they want it. They always want us, all of them want us, the whole world wants us. So we are in a great negotiating position. But I said, Kosovo, Serbia, we are doing a trade deal. You tell them we are not going to do the deal unless they make peace. Then all of a sudden they were hugging in the Oval Office. Great, right? And it came through common sense and it came for no money, could not make a trade deal. We said, no, we are not going to make the deal unless you two start getting you are killing each other for decades and decades, that is all they do is they kill each other. And when I saw the two leaders hugging in the Oval Office and I mean, I think they were exhausted, frankly. I think it was time, it was time, but somebody had to say do it, just seemed to make a lot of sense. I said, Wait a minute, let us do it. And we did it, so I am very happy about that. And thanks to our administration's unprecedented mobilization. We are now just weeks away from a mass distributing of a safe vaccine. We have got it, we have get great companies, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, all with a vaccine. All with a different, little different versions of it, some similar, some similar concepts. And many other companies and we are ready, we will have that, and we will have it. But even if you did not , and I say, it drives them crazy. We are rounding the turn, we are rounding that turn, we are rounding it. And our economy went down less than any economy anywhere in the world. And it went up faster by far. They keep hearing about Europe, Europe, Europe, well, they are not doing nearly as well. Seniors will be first in line for the vaccine. And the vaccine will be free because it is not their fault. It was China's fault. China did this to us. And our vaccine will eradicate the virus and end the pandemic once and for all. Americans will return to school and to life. By slashing red tape and cutting bureaucracy, we are producing this vaccine in record time. If Joe Biden were president, you would not have this vaccine for four years. And he had his chance with the H1N1, he calls it in reverse, swine flu, which was a disaster. We have moved heaven and earth to produce the vaccine ahead of schedule and manufacture hundreds of millions of doses in advance, all ready to be shipped. And we have our military is going to be shipping it. Logistics, we have a general, that is what he does. He delivers troops. He said, Sir, this is easy. We will get it done very quickly. It is the most advanced medical operation anywhere in the world and in history. Thanks to the therapies we have accelerated, we have already reduced the mortality rate. 85%, think of the that, down 85%. And our excess mortality rate is 40% lower than Europe's. And Europe has done a good job, it is a very brutal thing. Everyone thought Germany was doing great, great, great, great, they are not doing great. Right now you see what is going on over there with France, again, Spain and Italy. But we are doing great, but we just do not get credit for it. We do not get credit. And I do not want the credit personally, but I want the generals and the admirals, and our great Vice President Mike Pence, who worked so hard. All of the people on the task force and Jared Kushner, what he did, he is here someplace. But he was fantastic on the ventilators. Ventilators are very, very complex. Oh, look at that, Jared, and he wants no praise, he could not care less. He truly could not care. Thank you, Jared. No, we had a tremendous just a quick story, we had a tremendous ventilator problem because we were not equipped for a thing like this. This is once in 100 years, 1918, we are talking about, the Spanish Flu. And we were not equipped for that. And all of a sudden we are getting calls. We need 40,000 ventilators. Like in New York, they needed far less than that, but they needed many, many ventilators. And other states are calling, we need ventilators. And it is a very complicated piece of equipment, as you can imagine with pipes going down, heavily computerized. And people did not know what to do, making them on a mass scale like this, hospitals had very few of them. And Jared called up some of his genius friends, his brother is one of the most important people in Silicon Valley, smart family. They called up and they had these super brilliant young men come in. I mean, some of them were wearing undershirts, they were wearing a. They are wearing a baseball cap. How much are you worth? About a billion dollars, sir. They had founded companies, sold their companies, but they were brilliant. One of them had roller skates on and they wanted to throw him out of the White House. They said, Sir, there is a kid here, undershirt and rollerskates. I said, Yeah, he is worth two and half billion dollars. But Jared called a whole group of people down. And to them, to us, to all of us, a ventilator is very complicated. To them it is like the simplest machine they have ever seen. And they went to the automobile companies where they had excess plant capacity. And they went to various companies. And we started producing within a short period of time, ventilators. And this story is just never told, and I do not think I have ever told it, not in this detail. We started producing ventilators in a short period of time at a level that nobody thought was thousands and thousands nobody thought was even possible. And in a relatively short period of time, after that, all of our hospitals were sent tens of thousands of ventilators, tens of thousands of ventilators. Great companies, very big companies, the car companies, very big companies. They did a fantastic job. They'd line up with a small ventilator company, and we make the best ventilators, I mean, they say they are the best. And they were sent all over our country. And think of it, and that was done so quickly. But these brilliant young people were able to do it. Regular people could I mean, you could never do a thing like this. So we made thousands a month and not one person, think of this, in our country, not one person who needed a ventilator did not get a ventilator, how incredible is that? But they will not tell that story. That is not me, that is Jared and a whole group of very brilliant people, together with the military and with a lot of great companies. We have had a tremendous relationship. It is the biggest mobilization since World War II. And it was an incredible job. Now what we are doing is we are making we continue to make thousands a month and we are sending them to foreign countries who were desperate for ventilators. And would have no idea, there would be no way they could ever get them. Including, I mean, we sent them to France and we sent them to Spain, and Italy, but we send them to countries in Africa, who are really having a terrible hard time. And we are sending thousands of them to other countries. And I just think it is a tremendous story. And it is something that we did that we are very proud of. And I did something that nobody talks about. You do not hear about you do not hear the word ventilators anymore. You know why you do not hear about it because we solved There was a period of time, ventilators, for three, four or five weeks until they sent these super geniuses in. For three, four, five weeks, all you have heard about was ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. Well, we took over something, the cupboards were bare. They were bare, or essentially bare, but they were bare. And the hospitals in the states, the cupboards were bare too. Nobody was prepared for a thing like this. That could have been, they should have been. But now all over the world we are sending them and I think it is just a tremendous story, I really do. It is a story that is untold, you will probably never hear that again. And as soon as we started making all of these thousands of ventilators, you have not heard the word ventilator just like and there is one other quick story. The wall, the wall, the wall, that is all you heard. ENTITY promised the wall, will he ever give the wall? The wall, the wall. And then now the wall is going to be completed very quickly. We have over 400 miles of wall built. And now you never hear the word wall. They never say, Oh, he got the wall, he did it. And we built it exactly to the specifications of the border patrol. And they were tough specs, I will tell you. I said, How about concrete plank? No, sir, we need steel, we need rebar and we also need concrete. Oh, that is great. But we got it built and they have to have vision. They have to have slats because they have to be able to see through what is on the other side. You cannot have once you realize this, I mean, they are right. So we built it to those specs. Very, very they have done an incredible job. We are doing 10 miles a week. We will be finished very soon. But you never hear about the wall anymore. Now if it was a failure, if we could not get it done, it would be brutal. It would be a brutal time for your president. Because of our relentless efforts, the recovery rate right now on COVID or the China virus or the China plague is 99.7%, think of that, 99.7%. And I am here, I am here, right? I am here. And these two great people whose property we are using today, what a historic property. And all I know is they said we just drove up the road, they have been here a long time, but not as long as George Washington, right, but they have been here a long time. And they said, and you have probably many of you said, do you see the crowds along It looks at Broadway, except a slightly more picturesque, slightly more picturesque. But it is thousands and thousands of people lined all the way down to the highways, it is incredible, and they are all waving flags. Most importantly, they are all waving flags and they are proud of our nation. And I guess it has something to do with Pennsylvania. I am going to be here all day today. But no, it is a beautiful site and they were very proud, and thank you very much for everything you have done. We are allowing younger, healthier Americans to resume normal activities while strongly protecting the elderly and those at high risk. And we are making the powerful antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that needs it, free, free. Wasn't their fault. But I had that and I did not feel good. I said, What is going on? And test positive, and I am the President of the United States, I could not bury myself in a basement of the White House as nice as it is. I actually got to see it one time, it is very nice. Like you would expect, it is a beautiful basement, it is in the White House. It is a very solid basement. But I could not do that. And I could not put myself in a beautiful room upstairs, beautiful bedroom, and stay there for a year and a half. I am the President. And I go to meetings, I'd say That is a lot of people. And then one day that happens. And I said I was not feeling good. And the doctor came in and great doctors, great White House doctors, Sean. They came in and they said, Sir, you have tested positive. I said, Tested positive for what? And they said, For COVID, for COVID. He actually used the term COVID, he is more politically correct than I am. I said, That is not good. But I did not feel good and we went over to Walter Reed Medical Center, which is phenomenal. I see the work they are doing, young men coming back so badly, and women, so badly wounded. I see what they can do, what they can do and nobody can do what they can do. And Johns Hopkins was great. We had a lot of doctors gathered around. But I did not feel good and they gave me something, Regeneron, and Eli Lilly makes a very similar kind of a thing. The concept is based on antibodies. And I woke up the next morning and I felt so great, I wanted to rip that Superman shirt open. I wanted to come back. I wanted to start doing a new trade deal and campaigning simultaneously. They said, Sir, how about taking it easy for a couple of days? But no, it is incredible. What we have been able to do is and I do not even know. Maybe now I am saying, well, it probably was not the drug, it is just that I am in such perfect physical condition. And I am very young, if you are young, so I said that. And CNN got very upset. Their camera just went off, the light. They got upset. They said, He is not young and he is not in perfect shape. I said, I am a great physical specimen. They did not like it when I said that. They do not like those kind of things. No, but I do not know, maybe I helped, I do not know. But I can tell you it is incredible what they have been able to do. And I think it did help a lot, frankly, because I got out of there fast. I could have gotten out a lot sooner too. I wanted to go out almost immediately. They said, Nice and easy, please, sir. But shows you, maybe I serve as an example, First Lady got it also and she is better. She is perfect. And Barron Trump, right? Barron, Barron got it. My young boy, he is 14 years old, my young, tall boy, I say, he is very tall. He is a good guy, good-looking guy and strong. So he has it. They say, Sir, Barron tested positive also. I said, Wow. Then I go, this was at the beginning, I go, I say to the doctor, like 12 minutes later, Doctor, how is Barron doing? Oh, he is okay, sir, he sloughed it off. You know why, they are young and their immune system works. That is why I say, get back to school, get back to school. Get back to school, open up this state, Governor, open up this state. And do not take advantage of those ballots, Governor, do not do it, do not do it. We will terminate the virus with science, medicine and- We will terminate the virus with science, medicine, and groundbreaking therapies and cures. I watched Joe Biden speak yesterday. All he does is talk about COVID, COVID. He is got nothing else to say, COVID, COVID, COVID. We agree. It is serious and we have done an incredible job. And at some point, they are going to recognize that. I said we have done an A+ job, but I give ourselves a D or maybe an F in terms of public relations, but now I will start talking about it a little bit. When Joe Biden was Vice President, his failed approach on the swine flu was, as I said, a total disaster and his chief of staff said that he had no idea what he was doing. I do not know why this guy said this. And now, they are thinking about bringing him into the administration. I guess, probably this is maybe before the flu came along or something because I am saying, Why would he say this? He goes, quote, We did every possible thing wrong and 60 million Americans got H1N1, far less lethal, by the way, far less lethal. And in that period of time, and it is just purely fortuitous that this is not one of the great mass casualty events in American history. This is Biden's chief of staff. Think of what he said. Where did this guy come? You are going to bring him back? It had nothing to do with anything we did. We did not do anything right. Now, think of this. And then he is saying, We want to take over what you are doing. Right? He says, We want to take over. Remember he said, when he first started running, that I did a poor job because I did not act fast enough. I acted in January. We had almost no deaths. Think of this. And I said, China is heavily infected. They cannot come in. And I went up against Dr. Fauci and others that said, No, no. You should not do this. You should not do it. I said, Listen, they are infected, heavily infected. Let us close off China. So I did that. I closed off Europe. I did that and, Fauci will tell you, saved tens of thousands of lives. Much more than that. And then when you think, okay, we saved thousands and thousands of lives and then Biden is campaigning. And he was two and a half months later, he said, We have to get tough, and he called me xenophobic because I closed. Two and a half months later, then he runs and he said, He should've closed the country earlier. I said, I do not think he is going to get away with that. And let us see what happens on November 3rd because, if something happens that is wrong where he did, then he did get away with that. Now, here is a guy, not the smartest guy out there and he never was, but now in particular he is not doing so well, but here is somebody that says that I did not act early enough and, for two and a half months, he was scolding everybody saying that they should not have closed off China, they should not have done and that nothing bad is going to happen. But remember the statement from his That was his chief of staff made that statement. We mourn for every life lost to the China virus and in their memory and their sacred memory. We truly do. We mourn. It should've never happened. We will defeat the virus and emerge stronger and more unified than ever before. That is all we can say. We are going to be more unified than ever before. Our economy is now surging back faster, better, bigger, and stronger than any nation on earth. We just had the best quarter of economic growth ever recorded, by more than double. A 33.1% increase, more than our great number from 1952. That was the number we but more than double. And you know what? The press is refusing to talk about it. It is not even a major story. One of the analysts said today it was the greatest economic number that they have ever seen. GDP up 33.1%. That means it grew 33 in a quarter. And the press barely mentions it, not even on the front page of newspapers because that is the game they play. It is suppression. That is why we have to win. We cannot let them do this. We have to win. This was according to a certain very important person, Larry Kudlow, who is a terrific guy and other people. Sir, this is the greatest financial number probably ever recorded in our country. Think of that. That is a big statement. And double, more than double a number from 1952 and it is barely covered. And that is only for one reason; because they want us to do very poorly on November 3rd. They do not want to tell the American public about this. The one advantage I do have is I do have a way of getting the word out, but it is very tough when they pick it up. Even this, they will not pick this up. I made a statement, strong statement. They will not pick it up because it is good news. They will fabricate stories. They will make up false stories. They will put you number one on Twitter all the time, stories that are not trending. These stories are so boring. They will make up The Times will write false stories all the time, and yet they will not talk about the Biden corruption. They will not talk about where is Hunter and they will not talk about Do not feel bad. The cameras are all off. Do not worry. We just lost the last camera. I am sorry. But they will not talk about the fact that Hunter got $183,000 a month to sit on a board of Burisma and got perhaps $3 million up front, who had no job, who had no experience in energy. They will not talk about the fact that the wife of the Mayor of Moscow gave him $3.5 million. For what? They will not talk about the fact that the father went to China and Air Force to where is Hunter? Where is ? I put his first name, his real first name is Where. We are going to make it Where. Where is Hunter was with him. And in 10 minutes, he walked out with $1.5 billion to manage, which is millions of dollars in fees, millions and millions. And they will not talk about the fact that he was going for the big one next when China asked for $10 million a year for introductory purpose. In other words, he was going to introduce people $10 million a year. This is a payoff. That is all it is. And they will not talk about the fact that the father was the big guy. To me, he is not a big guy. Little guy. He is very slight. Remember when he said a year ago, he said, I'd like to take him to the back of the barn? I went like this. I will take him to the back of the barn. The glasses. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, if we do not raise taxes. If Joe Biden is elected, he will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close down schools and impose a nationwide lockdown. That is what they are talking Can you imagine going And we are making the greatest comeback of any country by far and they are actually talking He is talking about a lockdown. He has no clue, but he is talking about it. That is his only plan, to make you a prisoner in your home, a prisoner in your own country and, under the Biden lockdown, the recovery will be totally killed. The economy will crash. The country cannot afford it. The people cannot afford it, but country cannot . Can you imagine? I mean, your state has to open up, too. All Democrat governors, you, Michigan, North Carolina, they are all Democrat governors and they are probably doing it because they want to affect the election. They are probably doing it, by November 4th, they will announce, We have decided to open up Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be opened on November 4th. No, because they cannot be so stupid, what they are doing to people. And the countless people that will die from depression and drug overdoses and suicide and abuse and, really, a deferral of medical care. There'll be no school. There'll be no graduations. There'll be no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Christmas, no Easters, no Fourth of Julys. There'll be nothing. We will be nothing. And one thing we have learned very recently, everyone likes the computers and the laptop and, oh, we can learn from the computer. You do not have to go. Well, now we have given it the all-time mass test. A child being in a classroom or, if you are older, a campus, even a college campus, but a child being in a classroom cannot be replaced by a computer. It cannot . It does not work. It is no good. And they are losing potentially years out of their life and it is the important years. It is the development years, but the computers do not work. They are okay, but they are a small percentage and that is come out loud and clear. Telehealth, great. It is been incredible. I think it is a 7,000% increase and telehealth has been really great. It is going to have a great future, but not education. They have to be in their classroom with other students and they have to find their way in life. And this is no future for what they are doing in Pennsylvania, what they are doing in other states. This is no future for American youth. It is going to have a longterm impact on them. Biden's plan will destroy America. My plan will destroy the virus and make America greater than it is ever been. And the skyrocketing cases in Europe have shown Draconian lockdowns, and that is what they are, they are Draconian, do not stop the virus. They have done it. Italy was so locked down now. It is starting all over again. They just do not . It is a terrible thing that was unleashed on us and we should never forget what happened. We should never, ever forget that China could've stopped it. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, but not from going to Europe, the United States, and the rest of the world. We can never forget it, but the far left is determined to lock down America because what they crave more than anything else is power and control over you. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain. In exchange for his party's nomination, he has surrendered his party to the radical socialist left-wing extremists, anarchists, looters. Today's left tolerates no challenge and allows no descent. You see that. They have them locked down. That is the ultimate lockdown. You can do horrible things or you can do nothing wrong and they will put in stories. I am actually a victim of the opposite. I am just thinking about when I am talking to you. They do phony stories that are totally false and they will put them up and there is nothing you can do. There is nothing you can do except explain it away. If you disagree with them, they try to humiliate you, smear you, and cancel you, cancel culture. Right? They control Joe Biden, and he is so easy to control, just like they control every Democrat house member and every senator. They purge newsrooms of reporters who do not swear allegiance to their false narratives. You have seen some reporters are extremely upset. They end up getting absolutely decimated. They censor stories that reveal the corruption of their chosen candidate. This is what is happened now and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Everybody knows that it is It is incredible. Nobody's seen anything like it. You do not read anything. You go to the Times, there is no story in it. You go to the Washington Post, you go to ABC, you go to NBC, the worst of all in my opinion, NBC. The home of the Apprentice. Made them a lot of money over the years, but they were bad. They were very bad. CBS has been terrible. CNN is just absolutely ridiculous. Thank goodness they have lousy ratings. Thank goodness. And I call it MSDNC. What they do is just absolutely It is not even thinkable. It is not even to be believed. They totally close it down and you cannot have scandal when nobody's reporting about it. And the level of power is pretty incredible. And I heard this four years ago, Sir, you cannot compete with big tech. You cannot compete. The networks were against us. It was the same group. And then I won. I said, See, they are not very powerful? But you know what? They are. And now they are at a level that nobody's ever seen before and they are blatant about it. Now they just say, We are doing it. New York Times, they apologized to their subscribers because they were losing, after the last election, tens of thousands of subscribers and they wrote a letter of apology. I could not believe it. And they really got good for about two weeks and then they got worse than ever. I mean, it is every day, a phony story, after story, after story. They have a story about taxes. I do not pay taxes. And I just call my people, What? Oh, no. You have paid many, many millions of taxes, sir, but you prepay your taxes. Oh. Well, why are not they mentioning it? I prepaid millions and millions of dollars of tax. I prepaid. That is worse than paying taxes. I am prepaying. I say, Why do we prepay so much? Because these are estimates when you are negotiating taxes. These are estimates. You are prepaying estimates. How much? Many millions of dollars, millions and millions, but they do not do that. We call them, we tell them and they say, Well, that is prepaying. Well, prepaid is worse than right? I mean, how good is that? We are prepaying, but they do not put that in the story. These are very corrupt, very dishonest people. They tell you that writers are peaceful protestors because you are not allowed to have I had it yesterday in Minnesota where we were going to have over 25,000 people. And the Governor of Minnesota, radical left Democrat and the Attorney General, they said, No, the most you can have is 250 people. To my people they said that. And so my people said, So we are going to close it down. We had thousands of people. I do not know. You probably all saw it last night. We had tens of thousands. We were going to have 25,000, 30,000 people. And do not forget, they have done a terrible job in Minnesota where they let Minneapolis burn down. And they could've called us a lot sooner. We went in. Took us about, what, 25 minutes to solve the problem? No, we could've gone in there. We were willing. We called them. We were willing to go there immediately instead of having everybody running away. And they have a very good police or they had a very good police force, but they do not let them do what they have to do. And they shut it down. They said, No, you cannot have 25,000, but you can have 250 people. And I said to my people, No, let us go. Let us speak in front of the 250. What I did not know is that thousands of people were going, anyway. They just went. And I think that, had I done a regular rally with because we are getting 25,000, 30,000 people. We are getting much more than that in some. Nobody's ever seen anything like this. Laura Ingraham had a show last night. She said, I have worked for everybody. I have worked for Reagan and nobody's ever seen anything like what is happening. It is a great thing. It is an incredible thing. This is supposed to be a little special speech, but you have never seen anything like this. Nobody's ever seen it. And what happened is, I think because of what they did when they said, We are going to silence his voice, it turned out to be a much bigger voice, and I think we now are going to 1972, Minnesota has not been won. Between Omar, Ilhan Omar, who comes from Minnesota I think Omar, a couple of other things, the riots, but I think what happened is they made this into a massive event and people are tired of it. And I think we will win Minnesota. We were very close last time. And we should win it, when they let Minneapolis burn. We should win it, but I think we are going to win it. And again, 1972 was the last time. Can you believe that? I think we are going to do it. We will find out. You are going to know in about Well, I hope, based on the Supreme Court, they do not delay it too long, this decision yesterday. I will tell you, it was not a good decision. You are allowed to wait days to count and days to have the final count? You are allowed to have time limits beyond November 3rd? So what does this mean? The whole world and our nation is going to be waiting, and waiting, and waiting to hear who won? You are going to be waiting for weeks? And a very dangerous thing happens. November 3rd and now you have to wait and wait. And very bad things can happen with ballots during that period of November 3rd to whatever date they gave them. Many, many days. So you are going to be watching on November 3rd. I think it is highly likely you are not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania's very big and, as you know, there was another state, but perhaps other states involved. This is a terrible thing that they have done to our country. And that is the United States Supreme Court I am talking about. That is a terrible, political, horrible decision that they made. We are going to be waiting. November 3rd is going to come and go and we are not going to know. And you are going to have bedlam in our country and you are going to have this period of nine days or seven days or whatever it is. And many bad things Ballots are going to be Oh, we just found 10,000 ballots. Oh, that is good. We just found another 10,000. This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country. And I say it and I say it loud and I say it proud. We have to know who won. We have to know who won. They tell you the police officers are villains. This is the group. And they are heroes. No. These even tell you that your children must be indoctrinated to believe that the heroes who crossed the Delaware were driven by hatred and malice. They change your history. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to give this radical movement absolute power and unchecked control over every aspect of American life. Joe Biden, who is not he is not all there. You should get a little bit of a larger frame, do not you think? No, there. I know those glasses. You have got to get a little I will tell him. He does not want to have people look at that surgery on the eyes. It did not work out. Joe Biden and the socialist left are absolutely convinced of their own moral superiority. I do not know if he is, but they are. He is not . Look, let us face it. He is shot. Same. Who said that? Who is that? That was exact timing, right? You copied me from another. While their agenda devastates the poor and The American middle class will be devastated. They support crippling shutdowns that crush the blue collar jobs while they stay home and work. They close down your schools, your children while they hire private tutors for their children. They ban you from going to church while they let left-wing extremists burn down your church. You can only meet if it is a protest. So you know what we do? Even in this. I call this a protest. Otherwise, they do not let you meet. You cannot go to church, right? You cannot go to church. What they are doing to our churches and our synagogues and all of that is just terrible. You see what is going on. Even when the church wants to go into a field and stay apart, they say, No, you cannot do that. It is a terrible thing. They lecture you on the need for open borders that flood your cities with illegal drugs and gangs while they, themselves Borders that flood your cities with illegal drugs and gangs while they themselves live in walled-off compounds. They want to defund your police and confiscate your guns simultaneously, while they themselves are protected with armed guards. No, we will protect your second amendment 100%. There is only one way to preserve, protect, and defend the American way of life. You must show up on November 3rd, okay? Do not worry about the first or second, because I know you too well. The Biden/Harris economic policies of increasing taxes and regulations, biggest tax increase in the history of our country is what they are proposing. Would pulverize our middle-class. Their plan is projected to hammer the typical American family's income by over $6,500 a year in the Wall Street Journal. By contrast, I cut taxes and regulations at a level nobody's ever done before, and raised middle-class families incomes' over $6,000 in just three short years. And that is not including energy, which is a tremendous, what we have done with energy is tremendous. Joe Biden has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike, socialized medicine, an avalanche of job killing regulations, a return to globalist trade deals. And he vowed the total destruction of the Pennsylvania oil industry and fracking, fracking has gone. Fracking is gone. Man. He said that loud and clear for a year until he realized that he has to win in Pennsylvania. But fracking is dead because they are side it is dead. You saw AOC go out and say, no, no, no, you cannot say that when Biden switched and he never had one question from the press, how could you say it for a year, and then all of a sudden switch when you walk into Pennsylvania. Now, fracking would be dead. Joe Biden's plan to abolish American energy is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. A vote for Biden is a vote to ban fracking and to send your state into a nightmare of poverty and depression, that is what is going to happen. It is your single biggest industry by far, probably a million jobs one way or the other and what it would do to our country because our country has low energy costs. You and Texas and others. Think of Texas. He is running in Texas. We are doing very well in Texas, but if you believe the fake news, they will tell you, Oh, it is very close. It is not close at all. And it was not close four years ago. Think of Texas. It is very close. He is against oil, he is against guns, and he is against religion. And then they say, Texas is very close. Think of that, right? He is against oil, guns, and God, Texas is very close, too close to call. I do not think so. I think Texas, Texas is going to be very strong for us. Can you imagine going into Texas, say we are going to take your guns away, and by the way, we are going to close up every oil well that you have. Vote for me, vote for Joe. I do not think so. I do not think so. If Biden wins, there will be no fracking, no oil, no natural gas, no jobs, and no future. Under Biden, gas prices will explode, family incomes will plummet, and the fracking industry will be outlawed forever. Forever. With your vote, I will cut middle-class taxes even more. I mean, we cut them at the highest level in the history of our country, even more, and you saw what it did. That is why we are coming back so quick, because we have a strong foundation, a base. And I will always defend and promote Pennsylvania energy. And there will be no more lockdowns. We are not going to have lockdowns. We will never lock down again. Joe Biden would appoint the most radical left wing cabinet in history. Beto O'Rourke will be in charge of gun confiscation. Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren will be in charge of the United States Treasury, according to what they say. AOC plus three will run the climate policy. I wonder if she ever even took a course in climate? I do not think so, I did not say it, you did. This can only happen in Pennsylvania. Do not forget, I went to school here. He likes to throw around the Pennsylvania thing. Look at it differently. He abandoned Pennsylvania. He went to Delaware, but I am not blaming. He was nine years old or something, you cannot blame him for that, right? But he left Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania as you know. Representative Ilhan Omar will be running Homeland Security. How do you like that? Who knows? I just said that one, but you know what? I would not be surprised. Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to announce Ilhan Omar to run national security. She is going to run. She is going to be guarding our border, where we just had the best numbers we have ever had by the way. People can come into our country, we want them to come in. They have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit. Just imagine the insanity that will ensue. If Pelosi is speaker, Schumer is, Crying Chuck, majority leader. Kamala Harris, she makes Bernie Sanders look like a very strict conservative. Kamala, got to say the name exactly right or they excoriate you. So you have Kamala running the White House. Well, she already said that, right? She said that it is the Harris/Biden. He actually said that, that was scary. He said under the Harris, I never did that. I never said under the Pence/Trump administration. And I love Mike Pence. You know what? But I said, Mike, that far we cannot go. But he said, he may never say, he also said he is running for the US Senate two or three times. He said, I am a proud Democrat. This is like three, four times. I am a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. And we said, No, Joe, you are running for president. Oh, okay. Is this whole thing, I mean, can you believe that, this could only happen to me. And how are you doing? We are tied. We are tied? How can I be tied? We are tied. He said four times. The other thing he does badly, have not done it yet, I hope I never do, but he will be making a speech in Ohio, ladies and gentlemen of Iowa, it is proud to be. The worst is when he is making one in Miami with the palm trees. The beautiful palm trees. Ladies and gentlemen of Ohio. He is made that many times. And you know what I always say? Winston Churchill was a great, great order, right? Amazing orator, amazingly, because he was a stutterer in his life. He was a stutter and became a great orator. You could give a speech equal to the best that he is ever made. And if you made the mistake in saying welcome, like we are in Pennsylvania, it is great to be in New York. It does not matter how good your speech is, it is over. Just walk off, it is over. But he does it all the time, and nobody even says it. No, he is shot. Under my leadership, we achieved. And he is not a nice person. You know what? If he were a nice person, they do commercials on me that are so false. Like with the soldiers, that is the biggest insult to me of any thing that is probably ever happened, like with the soldiers and other things. This so falls based on a phony magazine, an Obama type magazine, that is doing badly. They did a commercial, and we notified them. And we had 26 witnesses, real witnesses. And every one of them is furious, but he is not a nice person. So because he is not a nice person, I do not mind saying exactly what I am saying, which as you know is the truth. He was never considered smart in his prime, but now he is really off. And you cannot have him as your president because he will destroy our country. He will destroy our country. And it probably will not be him because by the time he gets sworn in, he will be pretty much like it'll be over. 25th Amendment. Do you think they were talking about me? No, they were not talking about me. When she brought that up, they are talking about how to get Kamala in there as fast as possible. And nobody treated him worse than her. If you looked the debate, Kamala was failing fast, she was going down like a rock. Normally you pick somebody that is going up. She did not even make it to Iowa, right? Nobody spoke worse about him, and that is the one that they pick, but they want to get the radical left. They'd love to get her in. And that will be a very, I do not know. I do not know if you can never come back from a thing like that. I am not sure that a country, you look at Venezuela, you look at what is going on, where it was the richest, it was so great 20 years ago. Now, they do not have food. They do not have water. They do not have medicine. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in American history, the wall. Biden's planned to admit unlimited low wage foreign workers will slash incomes, surge unemployment, and devastate the middle class, all to enrich the globalist donors. As president, my only special interest is you. That is true. My only special interest. To protect our national security, I also suspended the entry of refugees from foreign nations compromised by terrorism, just call up President Macron as I do often, and ask him what is happening over there? You saw those horrible attacks this last week, more than one. We are keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, if I have your approval. Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in refugees. This is a deal made between Biden and Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie, the manifesto we call it. There is a document, a very thick document, naming things that they are all horrible, but they have agreed. 700% increase in refugees from the most dangerous and violent terrorist hotspots anywhere on Earth, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. These are some of the most dangerous places in the world. 700% increase. This is agreed to. This is not like, oh, this is talk. This is a manifesto. It is a document. He is also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones and terrorist havens. Biden's extreme migration policies will open the flood gates to terrorists, jihadists and violent extremists. You do not have to worry about it, just get out and vote on November 3rd. Under my administration, I had the ban passed, right? And it was approved by the United States Supreme Court. There, they did the right thing. Under my administration, the safest of our families will always come first. That safety, we want safety, has to come first. The Secretary of Defense under President Obama, Robert Gates, said that Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy issue in his lifetime. President Obama used to say that if you wanted something really screwed up, give it to Joe Biden to handle. This is the guy that we have running. In fact, Obama tried to keep Joe from running. He was very famously quoted as saying, Joe, you do not have to do this. You do not have to do this, Joe, do not do it. You do not have to do this. I could see that. And then would not endorse him until long after the primaries had ended and Joe has lost. Think of it. He would not endorse him. He was a vice president, would not endorse him. Made all these terrible statements, would not endorse him. And then even after he won, it was months before he endorsed him, because he did not want to see it happen. I think he is probably the most surprised person on Earth, Obama. And they said, Sir, Obama's going to start campaigning for him, a couple of days ago. I said, That is okay. That is good. He campaigned for Hillary. How did that work out? And his crowds are extraordinarily small, just so you understand. They are not big. They are like 22 people, 18 people. For months, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been inciting violence against police officers and riots, like those carried out by Biden supporters in Philadelphia. Look at what is going on in Philadelphia. They should call us into Philadelphia. We will solve the problem, or let their police handle the problem. Let their police handle the problem. If elected, the Democrat ticket will pass legislation to end cash bail, create sanctuary cities nationwide, and defund police departments all across America. In a second term, we will increase funding for law enforcement. We will hire more tough one crime prosecutors to put violent offenders behind bars. For 47 years, Joe Biden betrayed African Americans at every turn. He took your votes. He took you for granted, and then he shipped away your jobs and flooded your cities with cheap foreign labor. He devastated black families with his 1994 crime bill that really locked up tens of thousands of African-American men with unfair sentencing. And he called African American young men, super predators all the time. He would say super predators, a name that has always been something, there has been no name that they have hated more. They hated it with Hillary Clinton and they hate it with Joe Biden. Super predator, the term super predator. That was his term. He forged close relationships with pro segregation lawmakers and his trade deals decimated the black middle class. Joe Biden cares more about refugees living thousands of miles away that he does about Black Americans living in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, Baltimore, Oakland. He is done nothing. And then he says to me, Oh, we should do this. I said, Joe, again, always, so easy. 47 years. But he left. It was only three and a half years ago. So this was not a long time ago. I reversed the injustice of Biden's crime bill by signing landmark criminal justice reform, prison reform. And under our recently announced platinum plan, we will create three million new jobs for Black Americans, increase access to capital, restore safety to every neighborhood. And we will deliver school choice to every parent in America. And I am also fighting every day for Hispanic Americans. This week, I announced our American Dream Plan, and we are doing very well with Hispanic Americans. You see that? They are saying, What is going on in Florida, right? They like me and I like them. And we are doing very well with the Black community. They like me now, they are getting to know me better, but I have always liked them. The American Dream Plan, which creates over a half a million new Hispanic owned small businesses and jobs and going to be fantastic for our Hispanic Americans, great people. My administration is also standing proudly with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, and their righteous fight for freedom. Biden sided with the brutal socialist and communist regimes. You said what he did. You said that horrible deal that was made with the United States by Obama and Biden. I do not think Biden probably was too involved, if you want to know the truth, keep him out, but it was a terrible deal. It was like the Iran deal. Here is 150 billion for nothing. As long as I am president, America will never be a socialist country, will never be. This year I have laid out the boldest and most ambitious second term agenda in history. We will create 10 million new jobs in the first 10 months, 2021, we will have 10 million jobs over the next four years. We will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. We will bring home our medical supply chains they are all coming home. And we will end reliance on China once and for all. We will defend religious liberty, the right to life, and the right to keep and bear arms. And we will restore patriotic education to our schools. In our debate last week, Joe Biden said that America has, Never, ever lived up to our founding ideals, right? And he said it was an idea, it was just an idea. No, America's a great country. The United States is a great country. It is not an idea. It is a great country. Pennsylvanians know the truth more than most. When you think of the great history of this state, from Washington's crossing and Independence Hall in Philadelphia, to the Quakers who ran the underground railroad. From the union soldiers who lay at the rest and you lay at rest, they lay at rest in Gettysburg. What a place, Gettysburg, one of the most beautiful places and so gruesome for a period of time, never fight uphill my boys, right? He said, Never fight uphill me boys, never fight uphill. They fought uphill. To the workers of Bethlehem and Allentown who forged the steel that won World War II. America is the story of everyday citizens who have given everything to help this country live up to the highest ideals. My fellow citizens, you deserve a president who believes in America, a president who loves our country, and a president who loves you. Everybody knows that Joe Biden is not equipped to lead America. To Republicans, Democrats, and independents across this state, across this nation, I am asking for you to honor me with a vote that is going to make our nation greater than ever before. I will continue to fight for you with every breath in my body, and with your support on Tuesday, we will show the world that for our country and for our children and for the incredible people of Pennsylvania, the best is indeed yet to come. Thank you very much.

{"id": 1014, "text": "Good morning. There is much wisdom in these words from the Scriptures, Come, let us reason together. This week we have seen a good example of what happens when people talk to each other instead of shout at each other. And unfortunately, we have also seen what happens when some people go to unreasonable lengths to prevent reasonable discussion and decisionmaking. I am speaking to you from the Pacific Northwest where we have just concluded the Forest Conference. For years, the good people of the Northwest have been divided by a difficult argument over important values: how best to preserve jobs and protect the forests in this beautiful and productive region of our great Nation. Yesterday in Portland, Oregon, timber workers, business people, environmentalists, and community leaders sat down together in a conference room, not a courtroom. We discussed how to achieve a healthy economy and a healthy environment. And I directed my Cabinet to come back within 60 days with a plan for a balanced policy. Grass roots Americans want to end the gridlock and get the economy moving. They want to follow the same practice that we followed in Oregon yesterday. Unfortunately, some people in Washington, DC, have not gotten the message that the people want fundamental change. Yesterday the minority party in the Senate used procedural tactics to prevent the entire Senate from voting on our jobs and economic recovery package, which has already been passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives. Yesterday we also learned why our jobs package is even more urgent than ever. After 3 years, when America lost one million jobs in the private sector, the unemployment rate remained unchanged in March, and the total number of jobs in our economy actually declined. Now, some folks in Washington may think everything is fine, but all across America the people understand there will not be a real recovery until our working men and women can look forward to a secure, high-wage future for themselves and their children. The people know that America needs our plan to put 500,000 Americans back to work by beginning the investments we need in a stronger, smarter economy. It is time to move beyond the old politics of partisanship, posturing, and procedural delays and start working together to solve problems. Good things can be accomplished when we reason together. And just as this works in our own country, so too can it work between ourselves and other nations. That is why I am taking my first trip out of the country today to meet with Russia's democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin. Nowhere is progress toward democracy and free markets more important to us than in Russia and the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. Their progress presents a great security challenge and offers great economic opportunities. Russia's rebirth is in the economic interests of American taxpayers, workers, and businesses and the security interests of all of us. We spent over $4 trillion to wage the cold war. Now we can reduce that spending because the arms and armies of the former Soviet Union pose a greatly reduced threat to us and to our allies. If Russia were to revert to its old ways or plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess our plans for defense savings. That could mean less money for creating new businesses and new jobs, less for preparing our children for the future, less for education. Our economic program at home, more jobs and greater incomes for Americans, could be jeopardized if the reforms in Russia fail. My discussions with President Yeltsin involve measures intended to help the Russian people make the difficult transition to a market economy by helping themselves. I want America to act, but America cannot and should not act alone. Just as we mobilized the world on behalf of war in the Gulf, we must now mobilize the world on behalf of peace and reform in Russia. Most of this effort will have to come from the Russian people themselves. They will chart the path to their own future. These efforts to offer an historic chance to improve our own security, however, require some action by ourselves, too. Russia still holds over 20,000 strategic and tactical nuclear warheads. We are implementing historic arms control agreements that for the first time will actually reduce the level of strategic nuclear weapons. By supporting Russia's reforms we can help turn the promise of those agreements into reality for ourselves and for our children and for the Russian people and their children as well. And we can make life in America more safe and prosperous. For too long, work in Washington on issues like economics, the environment, and foreign policy took place in isolation. The interests of the American people were not amply protected because their voices were not adequately heard. The change we want is this: to bring men and women of good will together so that we can put people, the American people, first. We need you to stay active and informed and involved. Now, I ask you to call or write your Senators. Ask them to take action on our jobs and economic recovery package. I ask for your best wishes as I go into this meeting with President Yeltsin and your understanding that here there is no clear line between our interests at home and our interests abroad. We cannot withdraw from the world even as we work to make America stronger. Together we can change America and change the world.

{"id": 778, "text": "This morning we are particularly pleased to have President Moi of Kenya come to visit our country. He is the first President of that great nation to be an official guest of the United States, although President Moi has been here in the past before he assumed his present position of national leadership. He and I have gotten to be good friends through our frequent communications with one another as we met the increasing challenges and dangers of people who are determined to live in freedom. We share moral values, we share religious faith, and we share political values as well, not only on a personal basis but among the people of our two countries. We have been particularly grateful to see the leadership shown by President Moi and the people of Kenya, along with the nonaligned countries throughout the world, in condemning the brutal invasion by the Soviet Union of Afghanistan, and the staunch demand by others, led by President Moi, that these invasion forces be withdrawn from Afghanistan. President Moi and the people of his country led the entire continent of Africa, on their own initiative, in announcing that the athletes of Kenya will not attend the Olympics in Moscow this summer because their invasion forces occupy a freedom-loving country. This is particularly significant, not only because of the leadership shown by President Moi but because of the superb competence of the athletes of Kenya, world renowned for their prowess in past Olympic games. We are also particularly grateful as a nation to the people of his country and to President Moi for their unswerving support for us in the trying times since the innocent American diplomats were captured by militants in Iran and held hostage. President Moi has used his influence on a political basis to intercede for those hostages held captive and has also led other deeply religious nations, on his own initiative, in calling for a day of prayer and personally led a prayer meeting in his country for the safety and wellbeing and the freedom of the American hostages. This is particularly important to us, and I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart, as the leader of our Nation, for this initiative on his part. We value, as do the people of Kenya, the worth of one individual human being, and we also value, as do the people of Kenya, the freedom of each individual human being. We share a political process. It has been extremely significant in Africa and throughout the world to see the democratic processes performed so well in Kenya during this past year, when in open and free elections President Moi received an overwhelming mandate from his people to assume the position of President for a 5-year term. This will inspire others down the path of self-determination and democracy, and it is certainly an inspiration for the people of our own country, who believe so deeply in the same political concept and policies and processes. To see democracy in action in his region is a significant act indeed. I'd like to say, in closing, that we have long admired the inspired and benevolent leadership of the late President Kenyatta. And as the people of Kenya and the world well know, President Moi is filling those shoes of a great leader in an inspired and benevolent and effective way. We depend upon Kenya and its leadership to help preserve peace and stability in east Africa and in the western part of the Indian Ocean. I am indeed grateful that President Moi has come to meet with me, to make an official visit to the people of our country. And it is extremely reassuring to us to have a strong partnership at the official leadership level and among the people of the United States of America and the great nation of Kenya. President Moi, we welcome you to our country.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsvisitpresidentdanieltarapmoikenyaremarksthewelcomingceremony", "title": "Visit of President Daniel T. arap Moi of Kenya Remarks at the Welcoming Ceremony.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/visit-president-daniel-t-arap-moi-kenya-remarks-the-welcoming-ceremony", "publication_date": "20-02-1980", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 947, "text": "So we will update you on the latest numbers in the State of California. We will walk through some new announcements and then of course here to catch up, answer any questions that you may have. The current number of people have tested positive in the State of California is 335, that is a 14% increase from the prior day. Tragically, we now have six individuals that have passed away from COVID-19, the novel Coronavirus. The State of California has conducted some 8,316 tests, that includes our 19 labs of which 2,665 of those tests were done by our labs, but those labs, as I noted a few days ago, had been supplemented by hospitals from Stanford to a number of UC as well as our private lab Quest in San Juan Capistrano. I will remind you that Quest currently is operating just one lab in the State of California and conducting roughly 1,200 tests on a daily basis. That will substantially ramp up in the next week or so with the two additional labs that will come online. We will get those tests just from that commercial lab up to 5,000 as much as 5,500 a day. But the total number North of 8,000, and we are increasing our capacity on an hourly basis, not just a daily basis. Accordingly, we have advanced a partnership that was initiated well over a week ago with Verily, the health and life science subsidiary of Alphabet. We advanced that partnership with the idea of bringing to market the capacity for individuals that have developed mild symptoms or are concerned about their status from the perspective of being a vulnerable population, being our seniors or higher risk of contracting the disease to give them the opportunity to go on this portal, to answer specific questions, to be scored in terms of their likelihood to be needed to be tested, and then be allowed and directed the opportunity to be tested at what will be at launch to specific sites, one in Santa Clara County, one in San Mateo County. That portal, that page that allows people to interface will go align tomorrow and we will then begin to make reservations, and people throughout the course of next week will be in the opportunity to get the mobile testing that so many are discussing and so many have promoted. We expect that those two pilots, one in Santa Clara County, one in San Mateo County will significantly expand other parts of the state. We have a deep eye and consciousness on the Central Valley, other parts of the state. We want to make sure, from not just a density of concern, Santa Clara being one of our top priorities as a county, that is the answer of why we are starting there, but more broadly that we look at the issues of social economics and access as a big part of the advancement of the Verily partnership. We hope that this partnership can scale and we believe it will be a national model. There is simply no other interface that exists in the United States that allows people a portal that has questions and the capacity to geospatially identify where people are so we can identify the closest areas for mobile testing that we are aware of in the country. And so we are very encouraged by this partnership, very enthusiastic to finally announce it. I know there is been some conversations about it in the media, but it is going live this week in the next 48 hours, fully operational in the first two piloted areas in our state. We have the capacity currently through the assets in hand, be it swabs, issue that I will discuss in a moment, the issue of swabs. Not just the issue of reagents, not just the issue of RNA extraction kits that are part of our testing regime, but also the availability of swabs. But the first troche we have over 9,000 test capacity with the swabs and we will partner with Quest in terms of the diagnostics of those tests. The turnaround is typical at Quest, anywhere from two days, some cases three days, is roughly the estimate. People will be automatically notified based upon that screening criteria and based upon that interface on that portal of their test results. If people have severe symptoms, this is not where we want you to be tested. This is just a test. If you have severe symptoms, you need to engage the medical community directly. So we want to remind people, this is not to substitute that interface, but to supplement our capacity to get people that have some mild concerns and or people that are higher risks to remove them from overburdening our healthcare delivery system, to get them out of that setting and to allow people with the kind of portability that mobile testing provides to get answers quickly. But again, it is just a test, and so I just want to remind people of that framework and not promote it for something that it is not . So we are moving into next phase as it relates to testing in the State of California. Broadly, I think in the United States, there is still some capacity concerns. Not only on the diagnostic side, on the back end with the labs, both private, public, commercial, but as it relates to suppliers and one must be honest about that and forthright about it. But significant increases nonetheless in the testing protocols are being advanced, again, I think quite substantively with this new partnership. As it relates to the purpose of developing these partnerships, the purpose of our testing that is to identify through community surveillance where we are so that we could begin to process how we need to manage the status quo and how we need to anticipate the growth and spread of the virus and look at allocating resources across the state accordingly. I mentioned this a few days ago. I will remind folks, we have about 74,000 hospital beds in the state at 416 different hospitals. We have surge capacity in our state just shy of 9,000 beds, that is 8,661 beds to be exact, and that is on the basis of current survey that is very contemporary of the existing hospital system. We have about 11,500 ICU beds in our system, but that is not just for adults. That also includes pediatric ICUs. It is just shy of 11,500 when you add the two numbers up. We have new and detailed information about access to ventilators over 7,587. Not over. 7,587 ventilators currently reside in our hospitals and we have procured new ventilators, a few hundred that we were able to purchase, and we also have our own cash both through our MSA and our CDPH sites that include an additional roughly 900 ventilators, in addition to the 7,587 that I referenced. So I give you those numbers because a lot of people have asked about that information. Those are the most up-to-date and contemporary numbers. I also make that point as a point of consideration and segue to the subsequent announcement, and that is as we manage this disease and the dynamic nature of this moment, we need to anticipate spread but we also need to prioritize our focus. The purpose of today's announcement is to focus on specifically what we mean by that. Most important thing again is to protect the most vulnerable, protect our seniors. In the State of California, we estimate we 5.3 million Californians that are 65 years or older. Of those 5.3 million 65 years and over, we are prioritizing their safety because of their unique vulnerabilities to this virus. We also are prioritizing those with chronic conditions and prioritizing our homeless, and it is in those three areas that I want to advance some new considerations for the public, a new direction for the people of the State of California. We are calling for the home isolation of all seniors in the State of California. We are calling for the home isolation of all of those 65 years and older and those with chronic conditions. We are doing so with our eyes wide open at the magnitude of what that means and the need to provide wraparound services to support our seniors in need of medical supplies and need of meals and the like. The team assembled behind me and the people in this, what we refer to as soccer state operation center, of where we reside at the moment currently have 13 task forces that are working on a panoply of issues from logistics, from things as basic as not just food but water, fuel and basic supplies to more complex issues related to workforce and the like. So we are looking at this from a very holistic perspective and holistic lens. We recognize that social isolation for millions of Californians is anxiety inducing, but we recognize what all of the science bears out and what we recognize around the rest of the world that we need to meet this moment head on and lean in, not isolate ourselves to this moment, but lean in and own this moment and take actions that we think are commensurate with the need to protect the most vulnerable Californians. Number two, we are directing at all bars, nightclubs, wineries, brewpubs and the like be closed in the State of California. We believe that this is a non essential function in our state, and we believe that is appropriate under the circumstances to move in that direction. As it relates to restaurants, we have more nuanced concerns and considerations. Some have suggested just shutting down all of our restaurants. We do not believe ultimately that is necessary at this moment. Consideration nonetheless is to socially distance patrons within these establishment, and as a consequence, we are directing that we reduce the current occupancy within these establishments by half, and we require social distancing within those establishments. We have quite some flexibility in that space and we could talk more about what that may look like, but in broad strokes, that is the current directive and we will in real time absorb the capacity to potentially do more but also try to reflect on the enforcement side of this, which I am not concerned about because as you had noted with all of our directives, we are seeing a socialization in real time and strong and broad support, not only from public health officials up and down the state, but the private sector that has done a remarkable job meeting this moment. So that is on the restaurant side. Let me just briefly make this point. There is a concern around access to food for those that cannot prepare their own food. Not everybody has kind of kitchen you or I may have, not everybody is capable of heating their food. Now we are talking about home isolation. Not everybody is able now to go out to grocery store to get that food. Some may have limited capacities relates to deliveries, but we want to expand the points of access to get those deliveries. Restaurants by definition provide those points of access. So having an organized construct that allows delivery of hot, prepared and nutritious food within an existing infrastructure we think is appropriate again to this moment with the additional steps on bars, nightclubs, wineries, brew pubs and the like. Number three, in relationship to seniors as our top priority and home isolation, as it relates to bars and new guidelines on restaurants, I referenced the issue of homelessness. This is a top concern in the State of California in the abstract. We have 108,000 unsheltered homeless individuals in the State of California. We need to meet this moment aggressively, and I can assure you, I mentioned 13 of our task force teams that are residing in this building, they are our teams just working 24/7 on this issue to get people out of encampments and get people into environments where we can address their growing anxiety and our growing concern about the health of some of our most vulnerable Californians out in the streets and sidewalks. We are in real time procuring hotels and motels to convert to appropriate sites. We have just identified as Just an example, this is not even close to the magnitude of what we are proposing, but it is just a point of consideration and a proof point to give you a sense of what we are doing. We have additional 450 trailers that we have identified that will be dispersing to critical points across this state. We are working to address the needs within the shelters so that again we have appropriate distancing and we are appropriating ourselves as relates to social mixing for those vulnerable communities as well. So that is another area of deep and disproportionate emphasis that also we are advancing as a directive. As it relates to, again, vulnerable populations, you saw yesterday we put out guidance as it relates to an executive order directing along the lines of what the CDC and others have been recommending. We codified that in the State of California on visitation in our senior facilities, our skilled nursing facilities, our assisted living facilities. We now are tightening those directives to just end of life visitation, and that includes hospitals, not just congregate living facilities in the state. That is also a part of what we are advancing here today. So that gives you a sense of some of the current thinking of our healthcare professionals. Again, a number of them behind me. We have our finance team here and others in this building. We are gaming out the financial impacts, not just to the state's budget, but with disproportionate focus on families and individual budgets. This is a very different challenge, a very different crisis, and we need to meet this moment even different than we did in the 2008, 2009 years. We have to really focus on individual, so looking at our unemployment insurance or disability insurance, looking at how we can compliment what was done at the federal level. We are also sharpening our focus on what we request of the federal government going forward as we believe the extraordinary work that has been done by Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues, and we hope soon by the United States Senate can be complimented with even more support that we think is necessary to meet this moment. In more parochial, for some more pedestrian issues related to our work with the California legislature, we are in real time conversations with the legislature about our current budget and how we will process the concerns and anxieties people have about business as usual and environment where business cannot be as usual and we will be making announcements on that in the next number of days, probably the next number of hours potentially, and certainly tomorrow. On the issue, finally, before I open it up to questions, of schools, I want to say this, current number of schools in the State of California that have already shut down is 51% of all of the districts in the state. That is somewhat misleading number, 51%, because about 80% to 85% of these numbers are dynamic, and we will get you the real numbers. But we are in that range of 80% to 85% of all of our kids are no longer going to school starting tomorrow on the basis of 51% of the districts shutting down, meaning the largest districts in the state. 24 out of 25 of the largest districts in the State of California have already shut down. The one remaining in that group is current high school district which has remained open. Many smaller districts remain open and for reasons that are perfectly understandable. This is something we also want folks to know. On Tuesday, we will be putting out very detailed guidelines for those schools that remained open and continue to remain and are likely to remain open and those that have closed. We are vetting and curating and validating all kinds of private and public sector solutions to address the following and obvious real problems. How you feed people that cannot be fed otherwise because they are on free or reduced, not just lunch but also free or reduced breakfast. Some districts, 80%, some districts even higher, of their children meet that criteria 60% throughout our entire educational system. It is one thing to say you have a plan, it is another to actually deliver on that plan and with respect, not everybody that closed had that plan. So we are making sure we supplement that, take responsibility to meet that moment. That is transportation issue, that is a logistics issue, that is a siting issue, parks, libraries where we provide those supports. We also work with the private sector, and I must call out a Chef Jose who was there at the Grand Princess and is here in this conversation working with his organization to provide nutritious meal alternatives as well and to help us with the logistics and the distribution of food sites throughout the State of California. But we have particular concern, in addition to that, for special needs children, and this is something personal that I know all of us that have any empathy and capacity, as someone whose mother worked for Aid to Adoption of Special Kids, this is how I grew up with a deep consciousness and mindset for those with physical as well as cognitive disabilities. Many those children do not have places to go. We take for granted that so many of these kids are going to be taken care of, when in fact they are not going to be taken care of to the degree they should be, and so we are paying particular emphasis on those with special needs and making sure we meet this moment in the community childcare more broadly, defined, and we believe in quality childcare, not just access to childcare, what that really looks like. So that is what this planning process has been about. You may have noted just a few days ago we initiated, right? Put some information out in the initiation of that planning process. On Tuesday, we will lay out in detailed terms what that vetted and curated process and the protocols we want to establish look like from a very bottom up, not top down perspective, meaning districts and rural parts of the state operate very differently as it relates to community assets than some on the coast with large social safety nets. So we have to meet the needs of all of our diverse communities in a nation state with six plus million children, and I should just note the first six states that announced they were shutting down their education system combined did not even have as many children as we do in the State of California. It gives you a sense of the magnitude of the number of children that we are needing to address, that again puts a real burden on trying to orient an appropriate response to meet this moment. The superintendent of public education, I have been working very collaborative with us, our health and human service agencies and our logistics teams that also are represented in those 13 task forces that are included upstairs and in that total package in those numbers that I just referenced. So that is it on the schools, a little bit on our new advisories on bars and restaurants on social isolation home isolation for our 65 and older population and those with chronic disease. The fairly partnership that we are advancing, which we are very enthusiastic about and we hope is a model to this country, and then of course an update on the numbers of people that currently have tested positive. In closing, we anticipate as these tests significantly ramp up, the number of those by definition change the numerator, denominator, number of people will test positive. Again, we are just trying to break down how we prioritize those on the basis of need, seniors, homeless, and addressing the healthcare delivery systems capacity to meet the inevitable surge, and on that, I will just make this final statement. We have been in detailed negotiations and we will be bringing online, in the next few days, significant assets to help increase the surge capacity of our healthcare delivery system beyond the numbers I just laid out. We have already identified some very large hospitals that we can bring online that currently are not operational, and we could bring online in real time. We are in deep negotiations, and forgive me when you ask which specific sites are there, we are in deep negotiations to secure those sites. As soon as they are secured and the negotiations are complete, within the next number of days, we will announce those publicly. We are also looking on the basis of the work we are doing to triage the situation, not looking at the world in the aggregate but looking at the world as it exists within our diverse communities, meaning we may have a system that includes some 74,000 hospital beds but not every community has adequate number of beds. So we are looking to site our focus and our energies to increase capacity in those communities that need it the most. So it is , yes, North and South, but it is also from a regional basis, looking at other parts of the state to the inland part of the state, not just in Coastal California. But we are very encouraged. I am in particular, and I think I can say this on behalf of Mark and others by the advanced negotiations on sizable assets that could be brought on line. Hundreds and hundreds, in fact, I can say this. A minimum 750 beds that will get up if these negotiations are successful just by the end of the week in world-class settings, and we have identified many other additional sites that we are also initiating conversations. I will conclude on that frame to also acknowledge philanthropy that is been incredibly supportive, some of the largest businesses as well, that are helping us identify those assets and are procuring resources in a resourceful mindset to help us with the formalized leases and potential purchases of some of these assets in real time to meet this moment.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptscaliforniagovernorgavinnewsomcoronaviruspressconferenceannouncesclosureofbarsacrossstate", "title": "California Governor Gavin Newsom Coronavirus Press Conference: Announces Closure of Bars Across State", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/california-governor-gavin-newsom-coronavirus-press-conference-announces-closure-of-bars-across-state", "publication_date": "15-03-2020", "crawling_date": "03-07-2023", "politician": ["Gavin Newsom"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1086, "text": "Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Morocco is among America's oldest friends, one of the very first to recognize us as a free nation. His Majesty and I are continuing a very old tradition. The messages of our first ENTITY and His Majesty's illustrious ancestor, handwritten messages, carried between our two countries by a sailing ship, are very treasured in our National Archives. Thus, we are ancient friends. We are also modern partners--ready to stand together before the challenges that face us in modern times. There is the widening gap between population and food supply. The United States has proposed that all nations unite in a worldwide war on hunger. From our talks today, I am more confident than ever that our friends in Morocco are committed to that struggle. As I said this morning in receiving His Majesty, our ultimate task is to create among the nations of the world a community of peace. I often read and reread Article I of the United Nations Charter. I believe all of us-and especially those of you who are too young to know how the world felt in 1945--should come to know it line by line. Its principles govern the actions of American foreign policy from day to day: --collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace; --collective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression; --adjustment or settlement of international disputes by peaceful means; --the development of friendly relations among nations based upon respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples; --international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character; and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion. These words were written 22 years ago. In those years Americans have taken more than 200,000 casualties in collective measures to suppress acts of aggression. All of us, working together, at different times and in different places, have made sure that aggression did not succeed. The chances for world security are larger, and the hope for world peace is nearer, because tonight aggression has not succeeded. Meanwhile, in lands and nations throughout the world much has been done to lift the standards of living. In Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, cooperation in economic and social progress is no longer just a matter of words. It is a fact. So I tell you tonight that despite the terrible burden of war in Southeast Asia, I am confident that we will pass along to the next generation the gifts of hope and opportunity that illuminate Article I of the United Nations Charter. I think I speak for all my countrymen, Your Majesty, in expressing this hope and making this prediction, and also in expressing to you our best wishes for your long life and for your good health. It is our fervent prayer that our two countries will continue to do what is right, and continue to do what is needed to guide us to the peace and the 'progress which our talks reaffirmed today. Ladies and gentlemen, His Majesty the King. Mr. ENTITY, ladies and gentlemen: We are extremely pleased to have visited the United States once again to meet this country's ENTITY, its leading citizens, and to become acquainted with its great people. We are happy to meet on this occasion, in particular this select group of important men whose responsibilities cover all the various fields of politics, government, and economics. At the present time, the time characterized by an increase in problems which are so great and serious that they seem sometimes very difficult to solve, we deem it most beneficial that chiefs of state should get together from time to time. This we deem essential because we believe that as a result of their meetings and direct discussions, bonds of cooperation among nations grow stronger on the one hand, and, on the other, the chances for peace in the world become greater. It is this belief which has prompted us ever since our accession to the throne to visit on a number of continents the chiefs of state whose systems and customs differ from ours. We have seen that differences in systems and differences between races and cultures do not necessarily make it impossible to bring about a rapprochement of points of view, nor do they necessarily prevent the achievement of desired objectives. It is our pleasure to be visiting again today this friendly country and to meet His Excellency, the ENTITY, Mr. Johnson, knowing that our meeting each other will definitely open up before us wider and greater horizons for a free collaboration and cooperation in the interest of our two peoples. We aspire to benefit from the experience of the people of the United States, which has become an example and an ideal in progress in the economic, agricultural, and industrial development fields. We also wish to emulate the American techniques and methods which have resulted in prosperity and abundance, particularly as we have been for some years waging a relentless war on underdevelopment. We have been striving with all the power at our command to assure each of our people a life of dignity and value. Mr. ENTITY, you are undoubtedly aware of the fact that along with the efforts we are putting forth for development in our country, we are doing our utmost to strengthen the bases of democracy in our country and to assure our people their freedoms. In so doing, we believe that any system that does not protect the dignity of the individual, and any system that does not guarantee the freedom of the individual and the freedom of the community is a system that does not serve the interest of peace and stability in the world. Mr. ENTITY, the deliberations we have had, and continue to have, in connection with problems affecting our two countries, and also in connection with international problems, are only an extension of the series of deliberations and consultations, both written and verbal, which our two countries have had for almost two centuries. These deliberations are characterized by truthfulness and frankness as far as both the word and the tone are concerned. That is the case because it has always been our custom to talk in such manner. Just as the encounters of the past have been successful, we are sure that our encounter today will be successful. That is because all of us are determined that our relations shall always move from good to better. Mr. ENTITY, permit me, in concluding these remarks, to express my warmest and most sincere best wishes for your personal health and well-being, and for further happiness, prosperity, and progress for the people of the United States. Ladies and gentlemen, will you join me in standing and rendering respect to His Excellency, the ENTITY of the United States, Mr. Johnson.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandkinghassaniimorocco", "title": "Toasts of the President and King Hassan II of Morocco", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-king-hassan-ii-morocco", "publication_date": "09-02-1967", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

{"id": 728, "text": "Well, we have just held a very useful and, I might say, brief but also, I will add, a very moving discussion with Chairman Yunis Khalis of the Islamic Union of Mujahidin of Afghanistan and other members of his distinguished delegation. I expressed our nation's continued strong support for the resistance and our satisfaction with the large step the Afghan resistance took toward unity in choosing a chairman for the first time. This new political milestone demonstrates that the people of Afghanistan speak with one voice in their opposition to the Soviet invasion and occupation of their homeland. This increasing unity has already made itself felt on the battlefield. During the past 18 months, the Mujahidin fighting inside the country have improved their weapons, tactics, and coordination. The result has been a string of serious defeats for the Soviet elite units as well as many divisions from the Kabul army. Chairman Khalis and his delegation are visiting Washington, following the November 10th U.N. General Assembly vote, which with a record vote, once again, called overwhelmingly for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan. This is the eighth time since the December 1979 invasion that the General Assembly has decisively called upon the Soviet Union to pull its forces out of Afghanistan. And let there be no mistake about it: The withdrawal of Soviet forces is the key to resolving the Afghan crisis. Other issues that have been raised to divert attention from this fact only extend the combat and prolong the suffering of the Afghan people. General Secretary Gorbachev has publicly stated a Soviet readiness to withdraw. Both in April and September of 1987, I asked the Soviet Union to set a date this year when that withdrawal would begin. I also stated that when the Soviet Union showed convincingly that it was ready for a genuine political settlement the United States would be helpful. After all, the Soviet presence in Afghanistan is a major impediment to improved U.S.-Soviet relations, and we would like to remove it. The Soviets should want to do so, as well. Unfortunately, the Soviet answer on a date for rapid withdrawal has been silence. Instead we have seen the Kabul regime announce a phantom cease-fire and propose a transitional government, one that would leave this discredited and doomed group in control. These gambits have been rejected by the only voice that really counts: that of the Afghan people, speaking through their resistance representatives. Any proposal unacceptable to the resistance is destined to fail. And as the resistance continues the fight, we and other responsible governments will stand by it. The support that the United States has been providing the resistance will be strengthened, rather than diminished, so that it can continue to fight effectively for freedom. The just struggle against foreign tyranny can count upon worldwide support, both political and material. The goal of the United States remains a genuinely independent Afghanistan, free from external interference, an Afghanistan whose people choose the type of government they wish, an Afghanistan to which the four million refugees from Soviet aggression may return in safety and, yes, in honor. On behalf of the American people, I salute Chairman Khalis, his delegation, and the people of Afghanistan themselves. You are a nation of heroes. God bless you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithafghanresistanceleadersandmemberscongress", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Afghan Resistance Leaders and Members of Congress", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-afghan-resistance-leaders-and-members-congress", "publication_date": "12-11-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 759, "text": "Let me just first greet the members of the fire-service community, Members of Congress who are here, officials from FEMA, Fire Marshal Bernard Johnson, Fire Chief Rayfield Alfred, my own firefighters call them my own Engine Company 13 and Tower 10 welcome to the White House. We have got a few fires to put out around here, and that is why I have been late. Thank you very much. More than 2,100,000 fires broke out in the U.S. this year, claiming 6,000 lives. Fires strike at the most vulnerable among us, especially children and the elderly. And it also strikes the most valiant among us; many casualties are, indeed, the firefighters who lose their lives in a last-ditch struggle to save someone else's life. Then, after the cost in lives, we have got to count the enormous property losses in excess of $8 billion. Now, these dollars cannot adequately represent the tragedy of so many beloved homes, churches, and businesses literally going up in smoke. There is an army of dedicated Americans who stand ready to fight these fires, any-time, anyplace: the more than 1 million firefighters. The organizations involved in fire prevention efforts are too numerous to mention. But all are true heroes, and their heroic role is on display here today for National Fire Prevention Week. At the Federal level, the U.S. Fire Administration, part of FEMA, is the national leader in firefighting and emergency response. These men and women from the Fire Administration are dedicated to the development of effective programs to help fire departments, State and local governments, private business and organizations, and educators promote fire safety and awareness in communities across the country. At the State level, many dedicated agencies labor to provide training courses for firefighters and emergency medical technicians, arson investigation services, and research. And of course, in virtually every community across this great country are the men and women who make up the front lines in the battle, the firefighters, both career and volunteers, who continue a long and distinguished tradition of firefighting that goes back all the way to the first volunteer fire company founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1736. Congress also has a role to play through the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, whose cochairmen are Senator McCain and Congressman Curt Weldon. The caucus boasts 370 Congressmen and Senators 370 making it the largest on Capitol Hill. Most of all, Congress recently updated our safety laws in the Hotel-Motel Fire Safety Act, authored by Congressman Sherry Boehlert. All of these groups, from volunteers to Members of Congress, can tell you that the best way to fight fire is not with fire but with prevention. The National Fire Protection Association does a great job in this endeavor, working with young people such as Shanta Jones, the 1990 NFPA national fire safety poster contest child winner. In this and in so many other ways, they are getting the word out on fire prevention. As you know, Tuesday marked the anniversary of a key event in American history, the great Chicago fire, a sweeping conflagration that destroyed most of that great city back in 1871. Years later, outrage over devastating citywide fires led to a national effort to prevent fires. To focus this national campaign, President Wilson proclaimed October 9, 1920, National Fire Prevention Day. In 1922 President Harding made it Fire Prevention Week, saying that fire prevention should be practiced by every man, woman, and child not only during the week designated in this pronouncement but throughout every hour of every day of the year. That is true today. Every hour of every day, we can help save a life by preventing a fire. And we can keep these brave men and women with us today from having to risk their lives to save ours. So, I am again very pleased to be with you all and to sign the proclamation declaring this week as National Fire Prevention Week. Thank you all for coming down.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthefirepreventionweekproclamation", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Fire Prevention Week Proclamation", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-fire-prevention-week-proclamation", "publication_date": "11-10-1990", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 748, "text": "Thank you. Please sit down. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Roy Romer for his willingness to go back and forth across America, from here to Colorado and back several times every week to try to help us do what all of us need to do with our party. I thank in his absence Steve Grossman. We are all thinking about him and Barbara. Nothing hurts worse than cracking your elbow, I do not think, and we have got to be thinking about them. And I thank Alan Solomont for his work. And I thank all of you for your support. I have just come from an event for Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. It was a fascinating event. You know, North Dakota is a State that is so small, I felt like a sophisticate from Arkansas being there. And it is one of the few delegations that is completely Democratic, even though the State always votes Republican in Presidential elections. They have two Democratic Senators and a Democratic Congressman. And the first time Byron Dorgan ran for Congress was in 1974, the first year I ran for public office. And Senator Conrad was his campaign manager, and Congressman Pomeroy was his driver. And I told him that it took all three of them to lose that race, and I lost mine all by myself. But it was a very interesting and heartening event, because I was thinking about Byron Dorgan and Kent and Earl, and I was thinking that if any of those three had either not been there or had not been willing to put their necks on the line, we would not have passed the budget in 1993. And we would have not reversed trickle-down economics, or in a less pejorative term, we would not have reversed supply-side economics. And because we did, in an economic plan that invested in our children and our technology, in a fairer tax system for working people, 4 1/2 years later or 4 years later, we have got 11 1/2 million jobs, the first time any administration, period, had produced that much; 63 percent decline in the deficit; lowest rates of unemployment and inflation combined since the 1960's. That is what this party is about, and do not ever forget that. That is one big thing. I will tell you a little thing. Today I got a letter from a woman that I know from Iowa. I met her in Cedar Rapids in 1992. She was offering to defend me from the attacks that we are only interested in people like you. And she reminded me of this story of how I met her. I met her in a rally in 1992, and she was holding a child of another race in her hands. I said, Where did you get that baby? She said, This baby is my baby. I said, Well, where did you get it? She said, In Miami. I said, Where in the world how did you get a baby from Miami? You are from Iowa. She said, Well, nobody else wanted this baby. This baby has got AIDS. And later in the campaign, my staff actually went out of their way to try to help this lady in a difficult situation. She adopted a child when she had been left by her husband. She was raising two children on her own, her own children. She had barely enough money to put body and soul together. And she was at a political rally because she thought it was important for her future. And she has struggled to keep that little baby alive for 4 years. And that child is coming up to the National Institute of Health now, because a lot of the things that are now keeping adults with AIDS alive for very long periods of time, they are not quite sure how to do that with children. So she wrote me a letter because, she said, You have always welcomed us. You have always tried to help us, and we'd like to come by and see you. And I love this little kid, and I have kept up with her all these years. And I thought to myself, that is also what this administration and what this party is about, giving people like that little girl a chance to live the fullest life she can, recognizing the dignity of people like that woman who took what only you could characterize as a truly heroic stand to do something most of us in far more comfortable circumstances have never done. And all those things in the middle, that is really what this is all about. And we can never forget that what we do affects real people in real lives. So when we replaced trickle-down economics with invest-and-grow economics, we gave Americans a chance to have a better future. When we got away from hot rhetoric and got down to concrete action on social problems and we reversed the social decline, working with people all over America to get the crime rate down and the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history, we helped to give people a better future. When we restored family, not just in rhetoric but in fact, at the center of our social concerns, with things like the Family and Medical Leave Act and the V-chip and the television ratings and the regulations to protect children from tobacco and the earned-income tax credit, those things changed people's lives. When we reaffirmed the leadership of the United States for peace and freedom in the world and reduced the nuclear threat, that makes our future better. That is what I am going to try to do when I go to meet with President Yeltsin next week in Helsinki. What can we keep doing to reduce the nuclear threat? What can we do to build a Europe that is united and free, so in the 21st century we do not have the hundreds of thousands, indeed, the millions of young Americans going over to Europe and risking losing their lives, as happened in World War I and World War II. This is about big things. And I want you to think about that. And Roy talks about 1995 and '96 we had I found that experience sometimes exhausting but ultimately exhilarating, because we were fighting about real things, and the American people had to make a decision, huge, big differences in how we should move into the future, what is the role of Government in our lives. And I think the election pretty much resolved that. And we decided we would no longer try to have our daily bread by demonizing our Government in a democratic, free society. I can say that this administration has done more to reduce the size of Government and the number of regulations and the burden of it than our Republican predecessors, but we never could figure out how to use the rhetoric to convince the American people that the Government that they elected and paid for was their enemy inherently. And I think what we see now is that people want it to work better, and they want it to be effective. Today I had the privilege of appearing with Walter Cronkite and Paul Taylor, who spearheaded the coalition last year to try to get the networks to give free television time to the candidates for President as the opening salvo of what they hope will be a broad campaign finance reform effort that will actually open up the airwaves to all qualified candidates. And I said to them that I felt very strongly that now that we were switching from we were switching to digital channeling, which will give the networks far more options to communicate with people, that we ought to require as a part of the public interest more free TV time. And at least one executive, Barry Diller, has challenged his colleagues to do that. And it sounds like a lot of money let us say we just equal what is about spent on television that is funded now, about $55 million in the off-years; let us say $400 million in election years; that is still less than 2 percent of the total revenues of these operations. And when you get a monopoly on the airwaves, I think you ought to act in the public interest. All of us know that we cannot those of us who've followed the campaign laws under the decisions of the Supreme Court, the only way we can ever control the aggregate spending in political campaigns is to offer something to those who voluntarily observe the limits. And the only thing that is worth it is access to the voters in a free and unfettered way, principally through television. So we were talking about that today. That is something that is important to do. There are a lot of other things that we have to do here. We have got to balance the budget. We have got to pass the education reform proposals that I have recommended, both to raise standards and to open college. We have got to take more seriously this juvenile justice issue. Even with the crime rates dropping dramatically, juvenile crime rates are too high almost everywhere. But we know we can do something about it. I was in Boston the other day; I spent a day in Boston. There has not been a single child killed in Boston in a year and a half, not one, zero, because and it is not an accident because of all the things that they have done there that we have now put into a bill and tried to give the tools to the rest of the country to do, which is exactly what we did with the crime bill. So we have all these things out there to do, and that is what you are fighting for. But I want you to be proud of the fact that this country is in much better shape than it was 4 years ago because of specific changes that were made as a direct result of the efforts made not only by the President and the Vice President but by the people who supported us in the Congress and throughout the country. This country is better because of that, and I thank you for that. And I ask you for your support for all the things we are trying to do now. Stay with us. We have so much more to do. As I said, this is not a time, just because things are going well, that the country can afford to relax. We have to finish the job of balancing the budget, if you want the economy to continue to grow. We have to finish the job of raising educational standards and opening opportunity, if you want everybody to participate in economic growth. And ultimately, our economic growth will be retarded unless we dramatically improve the education of our people. Because of the job mix, the good new jobs we are creating, virtually all of them now require something more than high school. If you expect everybody to be treated fairly in this society, we have got to find a way to give jobs to those people on welfare. We have told them they have got to go to work. Who are we to say that unless they have work that they can go to every day? So there is a lot out there. Let me say again, I am proud of what Governor Romer and Steve Grossman have done in putting the Democratic Party foursquare on the side of passing campaign finance reform this year. And I hope that some of the decisions that are being taken now in the Senate will help us to do that. But I want all the Democrats to stay out there for that. We need to be on the side of positive change. We have rescued I believe we have rescued the debate from a sterile, meaningless debate over whether Government is the problem or Government is the savior. We know it is neither now. What we now have to do is to create a Government for the 21st century that will command the support of the American people and do the job that needs to be done to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives. That is what we are going to do for 4 more years, thanks to you. And I want you to be happy about it, proud of it, and determined to continue to do it. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteedinner28", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-national-committee-dinner-28", "publication_date": "11-03-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 929, "text": "Thank you all. Thank you for that very gracious and warm Cincinnati welcome. I am honored to be here tonight. I appreciate you all coming. Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace and America's determination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions-its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf war, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception, and bad faith. We must also never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September the 11th, 2001, America felt its vulnerability, even to threats that gather on the other side of the Earth. We resolved then and we are resolved today to confront every threat, from any source, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America. Members of Congress of both political parties and members of the United Nations Security Council agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons. Since we all agree on this goal, the issue is: How can we best achieve it? Many Americans have raised legitimate questions about the nature of the threat, about the urgency of action-why be concerned now-about the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we have discussed broadly and fully within my administration. And tonight I want to share those discussions with you. First, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction. Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today-and we do-does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons? In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced 2 to 4 times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for and is capable of killing millions. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran and on more than 40 villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than 6 times the number of people who died in the attacks of September the 11th. And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Yet, Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles-far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations-in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work. We have also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We are concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting the United States. And of course, sophisticated delivery systems are not required for a chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the Al Qaida terrorist network share a common enemy- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and Al Qaida have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some Al Qaida leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior Al Qaida leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We have learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaida members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them or provide them to a terror network. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both, and the United States military is capable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well, we do not know exactly, and that is the problem. Before the Gulf war, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was 8 to 10 years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime had been much closer-the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue. The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his nuclear mujahideen, his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? And there is a reason. We have experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing-in fact, they would be eager-to use biological or chemical or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world, he said, where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril. Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring. Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991. The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next. They forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. Eight so-called Presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass 12 square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above and below the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden. The world has also tried economic sanctions and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs of the Iraqi people. The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities, only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people, and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750 times. After 11 years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon. Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions, or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements, the Iraqi regime must reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside the country, and these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so they are all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without preclearance, without delay, without exceptions. The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. Saddam Hussein must disarm himself, or for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And that is why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council seriously. And these resolutions are very clear. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the oilfor-food program. It must release or account for all Gulf war personnel, including an American pilot whose fate is still unknown. By taking these steps and by only taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. Taking these steps would also change the nature of the Iraqi regime, itself. America hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. And that is why two administrations, mine and President Clinton's, have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great danger to our Nation. I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full power of the United States military. We will act with allies at our side, and we will prevail. There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait, and that is an option. In my view, it is the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to terrorists or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I am convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As Americans, we want peace; we work and sacrifice for peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I am not willing to stake one American life on trusting Saddam Hussein. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time. And through its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear. That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We refuse to live in fear. This Nation, in World War and in cold war, has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course. Now as before, we will secure our Nation, protect our freedom, and help others to find freedom of their own. Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse for world security and for the people of Iraq. The lives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. The dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control, within his own cabinet, within his own army, and even within his own family. On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery, prosperity to squalor, self-government to the rule of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women, and children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis, and others will be lifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin. Iraq is a land rich in culture and resources and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression, Iraq's people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors. Later this week, the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations and all nations that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something. Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq that his only chance-his only choice is full compliance, and the time remaining for that choice is limited. Members of Congress are nearing an historic vote. I am confident they will fully consider the facts and their duties. The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of Al Qaida's plans and designs. Today in Iraq, we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined and whose consequences could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on notice, and there is no refuge from our responsibilities. We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations of Americans, we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hope to others. And by our actions, we will secure the peace and lead the world to a better day.

{"id": 1064, "text": "Thank you very much. Please sit down. I want to thank the members of the veterans organizations who are here. General Jones, thank you for your presence. All the members of the administration and, especially, I'd like to thank Secretary Perry and the Joint Chiefs who are here, not only for their presence and their help on this policy but for their determination to go forward with this announcement on this very difficult afternoon for all of us. I want to begin with a word about Admiral Mike Boorda, our Chief of Naval Operations, who died this afternoon. His death is a great loss, not just for the Navy and our Armed Forces but for our entire country. Mike Boorda was the very first enlisted man in the history of our country to rise to become Chief of Naval Operations. He brought extraordinary energy and dedication and good humor to every post he held in a long and distinguished career. From Southeast Asia to Europe, he devoted his life to serving our Nation. I am personally grateful for the central role he played in planning our mission in Bosnia, both when he commanded our forces in southeastern Europe and later when he came here to Washington. He was known for his professionalism and skill. But what distinguished him above all else was his unwavering concern for the welfare of the men and women who serve the United States in our Navy. We will all remember him for that, and much else. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family, to his wife, Bettie, and his children, David, Edward, Anna, and Robert. And I'd like to ask everyone to just join me now in a moment of silence in memory of Admiral Mike Boorda. Today I am launching an international effort to ban antipersonnel landmines. For decades the world has been struck with horror at the devastations that landmines cause. Boys and girls at play, farmers tending their fields, ordinary travelers-in all, more than 25,000 people a year are maimed or killed by mines left behind when wars ended. We must act so that the children of the world can walk without fear on the earth beneath them. To end this carnage, the United States will seek a worldwide agreement as soon as possible to end the use of all antipersonnel landmines. The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and to stop the enormous loss of human life. The steps I announced today build on the work we have done to clear mines in 14 nations, from Bosnia to Afghanistan, from Cambodia to Namibia. They build as well on the export moratorium on landmines we have observed for 4 years, an effort that, thankfully, 32 other nations have joined. To pursue our goal of a worldwide ban, today I order several unilateral actions. First, I am directing that effective immediately, our Armed Forces discontinue the use of all so-called dumb antipersonnel mines, those which remain active until detonated or cleared. The only exception will be for those mines required to defend our American troops and our allies from aggression on the Korean Peninsula and those needed for training purposes. The rest of these mines, more than 4 million in all, will be removed from our arsenals and destroyed by 1999. Just as the world has a responsibility to see to it that a child in Cambodia can walk to school in safety, as Commander in Chief, my responsibility is also to safeguard the safety, the lives of our men and women in uniform. Because of the continued and unique threat of aggression in the Korean Peninsula, I have therefore decided that in any negotiations on a ban, the United States will and must protect our rights to use the mines there. We will do so until the threat is ended or until alternatives to landmines become available. Until an international ban takes effect, the United States will reserve the right to use socalled smart mines or self-destructing mines as necessary, because there may be battlefield situations in which these will save lives of our soldiers. Let me emphasize, these smart mines are not the hidden killers that have caused so much suffering around the world. They meet standards set by international agreement. They destroy themselves within days, and they pose virtually no threat to civilian life once a battle is over. But under the comprehensive international ban we seek, use of even these smart antipersonnel mines would also be ended. We are determined that lands around the world will never again be sown with terror. That is why I will propose a resolution at the 51st United Nations General Assembly this fall, urging the nations of the world to support a worldwide ban on landmines. I have instructed Ambassador Albright to begin work now on this resolution. Third, while the exceptions I have mentioned are necessary to protect American lives, I am determined to end our reliance on these weapons completely. Therefore I am directing the Secretary of Defense to begin work immediately on research and development of alternative technologies that will not pose new dangers to civilians. Fourth, as we move forward to prevent the minefields of the future, we must also strengthen the efforts to clear those that still exist today. At this moment, unbelievably, some 100 million mines still lie just beneath the earth in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in Central America. To help end the anguish they cause, the Department of Defense will expand its efforts to develop better mine detection and mine-clearing technology for use in the many countries that are still plagued by mines. We will also strengthen our programs for training and assisting other nations as they strive to rid their territory of these devices. For these efforts, as well as those to develop alternatives to antipersonnel mines, we will assure sufficient funding. I will personally work with Congress on this issue. Many have worked to bring us to this moment. I especially want to say a word of thanks to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Although I know he has differences with our approach, his dedication and his moral leadership on this issue have played a vital role in alerting the conscience of our Nation to the suffering that landmines cause. I also want to thank the many nongovernmental organizations that have worked so hard to put this issue at the top of the international agenda. As we turn to the task of achieving a worldwide ban, we must work together, and we will be successful. Let me say, again, I greatly appreciate the time and the energy that General Shalikashvili and the Joint Chiefs have devoted to this important issue over the last few months. It may take years before all the peoples of the world feel safe as they tread upon the Earth, but we are speeding the arrival of that day with the decisions announced today. I will do everything I can to implement them all, including the international agreement to ban all antipersonnel mines, as quickly as possible. Now, I think it is important to turn the microphone over, first to Secretary Christopher and then Secretary Perry, to finish the presentation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheantipersonnellandminesinitiative", "title": "Remarks on the Antipersonnel Landmines Initiative", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-antipersonnel-landmines-initiative", "publication_date": "16-05-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 1058, "text": "Secretary Kleppe, let me welcome each and every one of you to the White House this afternoon. I am extremely happy to have the opportunity to meet with you individually as well as collectively, and I am very proud to have the distinguished leaders and the elected representatives of America's Indian tribes here in the East Room of the White House. I looked over your schedule and I hope from the distinguished speakers that spoke with you that you have had an informative briefing session, not only with Secretary Kleppe but the others--those who were responsible for some of the Government Indian programs. I think it is vitally important that you tell us what your problems are, what your needs are, and then we can be fully informed as to the right policies and the right programs. Let me take just a few minutes to talk with you on a personal basis, to let you know of my personal concern for the needs of Indians and Native Americans. The Federal Government has a very unique relationship with you and your people. It is a relationship of a legal trust and a high moral responsibility. That relationship is rooted deep in history, but it is fed today by our concern that the Indian people should enjoy the same opportunities as other Americans, while maintaining the culture and the traditions that you rightly prize as your heritage. That heritage is an important part of the American culture that we are celebrating in this great country in our Bicentennial Year. Your contribution has been both material and spiritual. Your ancestors introduced settlers not only to new foods and new plants but to Indian ways of life and Indian values which they absorbed. This is a year for all of us to realize what a great debt we individually and collectively owe to the American Indians. Today you are concerned about such serious problems as poverty, unemployment, crime, poor health, and unsuitable housing on Indian reservations. I share your concern. I am hopeful about the future and about what we can achieve by continuing to work together. The 1970's have brought a new era in Indian affairs. In the last century, Federal policy has vacillated between paternalism and the threat of terminating Federal responsibility. I am opposed to both extremes. I believe in maintaining a stable policy so that Indians and Indian leaders can plan and work confidently for the future. We can build on that foundation to improve the opportunities available to American Indians and, at the same time, make it possible for you to live as you choose within your tribal structure and in brotherhood with your fellow citizens. We have already begun to build. My administration is supporting the concept of allowing Indian tribes to determine whether they and their members, in addition to being under tribal jurisdiction, should be under State or Federal civil and criminal jurisdiction. I have directed the Departments of Justice and Interior to draft legislation which would accomplish this goal efficiently, effectively, and within adequate guidelines. They have solicited the views of the Indian community in preparing their recommendations, which I will soon send to the Congress. I am committed to furthering the self-determination of Indian communities but without terminating the special relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian people. I am strongly opposed to termination. Self-determination means that you can decide the nature of your tribe's relationship with the Federal Government within the framework of the Self-Determination Act, which I signed in January of 1975. Indian tribes, if they desire, now have the opportunity to administer Federal programs for themselves. We can then work together as partners. On your part, this requires initiative and responsibility as you define your tribal goals and determine how you want to use the Federal resources. On the Federal Government's part, self-determination for Indian tribes requires that Federal programs must be flexible enough to deal with the different needs and desires of individual tribes. In the past, our flexibility has been limited by the lack of effective coordination among departments and agencies offering a wide variety of programs and services to the Indian people. Programs serving both reservation and nonreservation Indians are spread across half a dozen different Cabinet departments involving agencies ranging from the Economic Development Administration to the Federal Aviation Administration. As many of you know, this is Ted Marrs' last day on the White House staff. Ted's service as White House Liaison for Indian Affairs has been invaluable to me as ENTITY and to the Cabinet officers and, I am confident, to the Indian community. With his departure, I will announce shortly the name of a person who will assume Ted Marrs' duties in the Office of Public Liaison in the area of Indian affairs. This appointee will be an individual with responsibility to work with the Cabinet officers, with the Office of Management and Budget, with the Domestic Council, and with my legal office to encourage the improved coordination of the various Federal agencies and programs that currently serve the Indian population. As an additional step in this direction, I am also sending a memorandum to the heads of all Cabinet departments with Indian responsibilities, directing them to give priority attention to the coordination of Indian programs. These two actions will help to ensure that $1 billion spent annually on Indian programs and services will be spent efficiently, with cooperation, and without duplication. An important task we can help you with is the challenge of economic development of your lands. I congratulate you on the initiative that you have shown. I pledge encouragement. I pledge help in your efforts to create long-term economic development. Many Indian reservations contain valuable natural resources. There must be the proper treatment of these resources with respect for nature, which is a traditional Indian value. My Attorney General has established an Indian resources section whose sole responsibility is litigation on behalf of Indian tribes to protect your natural resources and your jurisdictional rights. Indian leaders and the Indian people have gained an increasing skill in managing these resources so they benefit your tribes and our Nation as a whole. I wholeheartedly and unequivocally pledge our cooperation in working with you to improve the quality of Indian life by providing soundly managed programs and a stable policy. We can make the 'rest of the 1970's decisive years in the lives of the Indian people. Together, we can write a new chapter in the history of this land that we all serve and this land that we all share. I thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmeetingwithamericanindianleaders", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting With American Indian Leaders", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-meeting-with-american-indian-leaders", "publication_date": "16-07-1976", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

{"id": 1076, "text": "Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: I cannot say that I am unaccustomed to public speaking. But I do speak before this audience with some trepidation--as a parent who has not yet come close to mastering the New Math. Up against your impressive scores and your scholastic records, I can find comfort for myself only in remembering that Thomas Jefferson once said, Nobody can conceive that nature ever intended to throw away a Newton upon the occupation of a crown. If there are no aspiring future Presidents here today, I imagine there are some Newtons, some Franklins, some Edisons, some Whitmans, some Hemingways, and, I would hope, a Robert Frost or a Carl Sandburg. I am very proud to welcome you to the White House as the first Presidential Scholars. I congratulate you, and I congratulate your parents and your teachers for their part in producing your talents for our times. You are not here today because you are typical, nor because you are representative, of your generation or of your graduating class. You are here because of what you have accomplished, in your own right, and what you have the capacity to accomplish in the future in your own right. You have excelled in the scholarship of your class of 1964. You have the potential to excel even more in the citizenship of your country of 1974 or 1984 or 1994. I have congratulated you. I want now to challenge you--to challenge you to develop and apply that quality of excellence which is within you. Demagogues and dictators believed of your parents' generation that American youth would prove soft--would love luxury more than they loved liberty--would choose comfort in preference to courage. Your parents proved that that calculation was wrong. Today the cynics and the doubters believe of your generation that you will be too content with the average to take on the arduous, you will be too concerned with conformity to be creative, too cool to be committed, and too callous to be caring. You will prove this calculation wrong, too. Your destiny will not be a faceless and thoughtless existence in a dull and dreary society. I believe the destiny of your generation, and your Nation, is a rendezvous with excellence. Early in this century, William James answered those who complained that our democracy had an instinct for the inferior by saying: ... The best of us are filled with the contrary vision of a democracy stumbling through every error till its institutions glow in justice and its customs shine with beauty. Our better men shall show the way--and we shall follow them. Today--as really never before--we must look to our better minds to show the way toward our society's greatest day. That is your challenge and that is your duty. You are exceptional members of an exceptional generation. You have been born to man's most exceptional opportunity. You are younger than most of the earth's quarrels, and you are older than most of the earth's governments. You are younger than most of man's ignorance, and older than much of his knowledge. Since you were born, man has developed both the capacity to destroy human life and the capacity to make life worthwhile for all the human race. A decade ago, many young people made fear and fatalism fashionable in the fifties. In these sixties and seventies, you have a much broader choice than the alternatives of terror and triviality. You are challenged not to serve the mediocre and the mundane, but to work toward the great and toward the grand. In our cities and in our countrysides, you will participate in the building of the second America--just as you will also be partners in building the first world of universal peace and justice and freedom. Today's vote terminating debate in the United States Senate on the civil rights bill is an historic event. Today's action demonstrates that the national will manifests itself in congressional action. One year ago tomorrow, President Kennedy in a radio and television report to the American people, declared, A great change is at hand and our task and our obligation is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all. Today's action by the United States Senate is a major contribution to meeting this national responsibility. That is your challenge--to give your talents and your time in our land and in all lands to cleaning away the blight, to sweeping away the shoddiness, to wiping away the injustices and the inequities of the past so that all men may live together in a great world community of decency and of excellence. What you accomplish as individuals-what all of us accomplish as a Nation--depends upon the goals and the values by which we challenge ourselves. The average and the adequate are too low as goals for Americans. Doing slightly more, slightly better year by year, is too slow. Our aim must be higher; our reach must be farther; our pace must be faster. Our society and its members must aim for, and reach toward, the goals and the values of excellence. By the standards that you set, by the services that you render, you will show the world that when the doors of equal opportunity are kept open in our democracy young men and young women will respond with an instinct for excellence such as history has never known. I congratulate you, each of you, for what you have achieved. I am so proud of you. I honor you for what I know you, and your generation, will achieve in the years to come. It is good to have you here in the White House today. This will be a memorable occasion for all of us. I am so glad that your work distinguished you so that you could come and be a part of this ceremony. If I may now be indulged personally for a moment, I would like for you to know Mrs. Johnson and my daughter Lynda Bird.

{"id": 593, "text": "Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thanks for having me. Thanks for the warm welcome. I appreciate the fact that a Texan is being treated so well here in Arkansas. It is nice to be in this part of the world again. Arkansas is full of really good people, decent, caring people, and so is this hospital. I am honored that you would have allowed me and my rather significant entourage--to come to Baptist Health Medical Center. I am here to talk about health issues. I am here to talk about one of the reasons why health care costs are going up. And that is the fact that we have got too many darn lawsuits, too many frivolous and junk lawsuits that are affecting people. I am here to make sure that we talk in a way that says to the people of Arkansas and America that we need medical liability reform to make sure that medicine is affordable and available. But I am here, first and foremost, to thank the people of this medical center, those here in person and those listening via cable. I want to thank you for what you do. I want to thank you for your heart. I want to thank you for caring about your fellow citizens. I appreciate very much your being on the frontline of healing, healing lives in such a compassionate way. Our health care system is the best in the world, and we need to keep it that way. I appreciate Russ. Thank you for your introduction. Thanks for being the CEO of Baptist Health System. Thank you for joining us in-we just had what they call a roundtable. The table was square. But nevertheless, we had a great discussion, and Russ was there. He talked about this hospital, its outreach, its not only desire to serve people in the city of Little Rock but also its desire to serve people in rural Arkansas. I want to thank Doug Weeks, the senior vice president and administrator, our host. I want to thank my friend the Governor for coming. Governor Huckabee is a-. Part of good health care depends on how you treat your own body. No, I am serious. I am absolutely serious. The best way to-one of the best ways to prevent disease is to make right choices. One of the right choices is to watch what you eat. The Governor has clearly done that. He is setting a good example. Another right choice is to exercise frequently. Some of us like to run-or used to like to run before we broke down. I try to exercise 6 days a week. The Governor exercises. And I hope people in Arkansas and around the country understand that the exercise is a good way to avoid disease in the first place. Making right choices is important. And Governor, I appreciate the example you have set for this great State. I want to thank the Lieutenant Governor, Win Rockefeller, for joining us. Win, glad to see you. He exercises too. I appreciate the mayor, Mayor Dailey from Little Rock, for being here. Mr. Mayor, thank you for coming. Mayor Hays of North Little Rock is here as well. Thank you for coming, appreciate you. You have got a tough job. I like to remind the mayors, just go ahead and fill the potholes, and everything will be fine. I know we have got leaders from the statehouse here, Senator Baker and Representative Parks and others. Thank you all for coming out and giving me a chance to share some thoughts with you. Before I get into the issue of health, I do want to remind you that our country still faces big challenges. And we are rising to meet the challenges. The most important job of my administration is to protect the American people, is to chase down those who would do us harm and bring them to justice, is to never forget the lessons of September the 11th, is to stay on the offensive, and that is what we are doing. We are spreading freedom, and as we do so, the world becomes more peaceful. Freedom is not America's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty's gift to each man and woman in the world. I appreciate so very much the contribution of the Arkansas Guard. Over 4,000 troops are part of our effort to not only make America more secure but to make the world more free. I know that the Governor informed me that these troops are ready to go. They understand the mission. They are proud to serve our country. I am proud to call them-I am proud to be their Commander in Chief. And I want their families to know how much we are grateful for their sacrifice as well. Arkansas ought to be proud of the men and women who wear the uniform, and they are going to make this Nation proud and more secure in their sacrifices. I told everybody the other night at the State of the Union that we are going to stay on the offensive against Al Qaida, and we are making good progress. We are on an international manhunt. We are in a different kind of war. It used to be in the old days, you could measure progress based upon the number of airplanes that the enemy had or the number of ships in a flotilla. And the big battles of the past were clashes of equipment that were visible for people to see. And this is the kind of war where sometimes you see action, and sometimes you do not . Sometimes progress is being made, and it is hard to tell it, because in order to dismantle the Al Qaida terrorists network, we have got to be on a manhunt, and we have got a lot of people on the manhunt. Just yesterday-not yesterday-just last week, we made further progress in making America more secure when a fellow named Hassan Ghul was captured in Iraq. Hassan Ghul was a-reported directly to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who was the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks. He was a killer. He was moving money and messages around South Asia and the Middle East to other Al Qaida leaders. He was a part of this network of haters that we are dismantling. Our intelligence officers did a good job. He was captured in Iraq, where he was helping Al Qaida to put pressure on our troops. There is one less enemy we have to worry about with the capture of Hassan Ghul. Our people are doing great work. This country's economy is getting better, and that is positive news for the people of Arkansas and the people of America. The tax relief we passed is working. See, I believe that when people have more money in their pocket, they will then spend or save or invest, and that causes the whole economy to grow, which then helps people find a job. Much of the tax relief we passed is set to expire, and it is set to expire right about the time the economy gets going. It makes no sense to have a tax increase on the American people at this stage or any stage as far as I am concerned. And therefore, we need to make the tax relief permanent. In order to make this tax relief permanent, let people keep more of their own money to keep driving this economy forward. Small businesses need to keep more money. You see, most new jobs in America are created by small-business owners. If you are worried about job creation, we need to continue to stimulate the small-business sector of our economy. Congress needs to act. They need to make these tax relief packages we passed for small business permanent so people can find work here in America. We also need to have an energy policy. The people of Arkansas understand energy. We need a policy. We need a policy that encourages conservation. We need a policy that helps modernize our electricity systems, and we need a policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. We need to open up markets for Arkansas' farmers and ranchers. When you are good at something, we ought to encourage the sale of those products elsewhere, outside of our markets. And we are good at things in America. We are good at growing crops, and we are good at raising cows, and we are good at being on the cutting edge of innovation. We need markets for those products. We need less regulation for businesses and small businesses. And we have got to deal with rising health care costs. Rising health care costs are making it difficult for some entities to hire people. Rising health care costs affect all Americans. We want our families to feel more secure. Rising health care costs create insecurity in our Nation. And so we need to continue the focus on costs. We are making some good progress, by the way, about helping people with health care. We have got what we call community health centers in America. I am committed to the expansion and the building of new community health centers. These are places where people who do not have insurance or live in areas without enough doctors can find health care. Community health centers make sense. It takes the pressure off the emergency rooms of hospitals such as this. We have opened or expanded 600 community health centers since 2001. The budget I proposed calls for another 218 to be opened or expanded. This is a good way to make sure that health care is available for those who do not have insurance yet. And so I call upon Congress to look at that part of my budget and continue working with the administration to expand these vital centers around Arkansas and around America. And then we worked on Medicare. You might remember what it was like before this year when people talked about Medicare. The political issue was really called Medi-scare. If somebody would talk about it, somebody else would say, Wait a minute. They are going to try to take away Medicare from the seniors. But I felt strongly that Medicare needed to be modernized. I felt like we needed to deal with the issue now and not pass it on like other Congresses and administrations had done. It is time to address the issue before it became so acute that the system did not work. And it was time to fulfill a promise to our seniors, and so we acted. I was proud to sign that bill, and as I told the Congress, If you try to change it and it hurts our seniors, I will veto the bill. It is going to take a while to implement the Medicare bill. It is a complex piece of legislation. After all, it is the first modernization since Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare in the mid-sixties. This year, seniors are going to get a drug discount card, which will save them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs. And the lowest income seniors will get a $600 credit. That will help seniors with drug costs. Secondly, next year we will begin preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease for seniors just entering Medicare, plus they will get a wellness exam. That is important. It is the first time that Medicare has actually been into the business of preventive screenings. Any good doc will tell you, you need to figure out what the issue is in order to deal with people. And a preventive screening will help the medical profession better treat our seniors. Finally, in year 2006, seniors will receive the prescription drug coverage they have been promised. For about $35 a month, most seniors will see their drug bills cut in half. That is a good deal for America's seniors. And finally, in the bill is an interesting innovation, one that is not the first time it is been tried, but it is now been expanded- they are called health savings accounts, which will allow Americans to save for future medical expenses, tax-free. And that is an important innovation, an important reform. Another way to help, by the way-or a way to help deal with rising costs is to understand the impact rising costs have on small businesses. A lot of big businesses are able to absorb the costs because they have got the capacity to negotiate better. When you have got a large universe of people that you are trying to cover, you can have more strength in negotiations. It gives you a better hand. The problem we have with small businesses is they do not have the capacity to pool together, to negotiate on behalf of a lot of people. And that is why I am a strong supporter of what is called association health plans that will allow small businesses to pool risk and have a better negotiation policy with those who offer insurance. Congress needs to pass this piece of legislation. It is good for the entrepreneurs of Arkansas. Lower income Americans should be helped with health care by refundable tax credits. It is been a part of my budget. It is an important reform. It will help with the issue of the uninsured. People with health savings accounts, when they buy high deductible insurance policies to protect them against catastrophic medical costs or hospitalization or major surgery, should be allowed to deduct those premiums. See, that will help with the rising costs of health care as well. Those are some practical suggestions for Congress to look at, ways to strengthen the private delivery of medicine as opposed to strengthening the Government involvement in medicine. There is something else we can do at the Federal level, and that is to promote promising health information technology. The truth of the matter is, medicine is on the leading edge of change. And some of the new drugs are fantastic about-to help save lives. Some of the new machinery is fantastic. The information systems of the health care system are a little antiquated. I mean, you are still moving files by hand, are not you? Kind of writing it out by hand.Well, what we need to do is to have standards and computerized records so that we can improve care and prevent errors, which will save money in the system. There is tremendous savings to be had by bringing technology into the medical field, and the Federal Government can help there as well. These are good steps. Yet one of the main cost-drivers, that has nothing to do with what happens in an operating room or a waiting room, happen in the courtroom. One of the reasons people are finding their premiums are up and it is hard to find a doc these days is because frivolous and junk lawsuits are threatening medicine across the country. And there is a lot of them, people just filing these suits. I call them junk suits because they do not have any merit. The problem is they cost money to fight. Every one of these junk suits that people put out there requires the expenditure of money, which affects consumers. That is you. It affects hospitals. That is you as well. In order to avoid protracted litigation, those who provide insurance oftentimes just settle the case. You have got these giant judgments looming out there, people say, Well, I better just go ahead and settle this, rather than risk a bad jury verdict. That drives up costs too. People just filing these lawsuits right and left, and it is running up the costs. Doctors' premiums, the cost of doing business, they are rising. That makes it hard on the docs. It makes it hard on docs to do what they are called to do, which is to heal lives. Medical liability premiums for Arkansas doctors rose more than 150 percent last year. That makes it awfully hard for doctors to do business. And what is their business? Their business is seeing patients. Their business is helping to make somebody's life better. Yet these lawsuits are making it hard for docs to practice their business in the State of Arkansas and other States as well. You see, the costs get passed on. They get passed on to patients or their employers. One of the major cost-drivers in the delivery of health care are these junk and frivolous lawsuits. The risk of frivolous litigation drives doctors-and hear me out on this-they drive doctors to prescribe drugs and procedures that may not be necessary, just to avoid lawsuits. That is called the defensive practice of medicine. According to a survey of the Arkansas Medical Society, 90 percent of Arkansas doctors say the fear of lawsuits have caused them to do unnecessary procedures. See, lawsuits not only drive up premiums, which drives up the cost to the patient or the employer of the patient, but lawsuits cause docs to practice medicine in an expensive way in order to protect themselves in the courthouse. The defensive practice of medicine affects the Federal budget. The direct cost of liability insurance and the indirect cost from unnecessary medical procedures raise the Federal Government's health care costs by at least $28 billion a year. Remember, we provide-at the Federal level, we provide health care through Medicare and Medicaid and veteran's health and Government employee costs. The defensive-the cost of defensive medicine raises your bill as a taxpayer. Not only does it make it harder to go see a doc, it also costs you more as a taxpayer. Medical liability reform is a national issue because medical liability lawsuits raise the Federal budget. It is a national issue that requires a national solution. You need to get your Governor-I know he is strongly, and the Lieutenant Governor is strongly in favor of liability reform-you need to work it here in Arkansas, by the way. Just do not rely upon the Federal Government, but get you good medical liability. It is tough, because some of these lawyer groups are some of the politically strongest groups in the State and the country. I understand how tough it is. But we are doing the right thing by insisting upon medical liability reform. We are doing the right thing by telling people the truth, and that is the health care system looks like a giant lottery. That is what it looks like these days because of these lawsuits. And somehow, the trial lawyers always hold the winning ticket. Lawyers walk away with up to 40 percent- 40 percent-of every settlement and verdict, which adds up to billions of costs, billions of unnecessary costs. Lawsuits do not heal patients. That is a fact. And they are driving a wedge between the docs and their patients. One of the most vital links of good medicine is the doctor-patient relationship. Yet many doctors fear what they tell a patient will be used against them in a court of law. We have got a culture of lawsuit here in America, a culture of lawsuits, a litigation culture, which is driving a wedge between the doctors and patients, and that is not right. When docs treat their patients, the only thing they should worry about is the health of their patients, not some trial lawyer breathing down their neck. Seventy-one percent of the doctors in Arkansas say they are considering early retirement. Let me tell you what is happening here in Arkansas, and it is happening in other States too. You are not alone. These frivolous and junk lawsuits are not only driving up the costs, but a lot of docs are thinking about quitting the practice of medicine. Remember, I talked about to make sure medicine is affordable and available. Lawsuits drive up the affordability. Lawsuits are driving docs out of the practice, which means there is less availability. You have got to have doctors in your communities. In order to be a vibrant, successful community, you need a viable health care industry with good docs. And yet, 71 percent of the doctors in this State say they are considering early retirement; 50 percent of the physicians say they are having difficulty recruiting new doctors to practice in Arkansas. This litigation culture puts a sign up there saying, If you come to our State, you are likely to get sued. Who wants to do that? People want to practice medicine. They do not want to spend their time defending themselves in the courthouse because of the frivolous and junk lawsuits that are too prevalent today in America. More than a third of the docs are considering moving out of State. See, that says to me you got a problem here in Arkansas. And by the way, again I repeat, you are not alone. Trust me, you are not alone. There is a lot of States that cannot get good medical liability reform through. Today I met with some decent docs and health administrators. Let me tell you their stories so that we get a better feel for why we need medical liability reform at the State and Federal level. Sara McBee is here. There is Sara. She is from Fayetteville, Arkansas. She practices family medicine. She was delivering between 80 and 100 babies a year. Now, there is a soul-a good soul who loves life to the point where she is willing to take her talents and deliver babies. It must be an unbelievably satisfying profession to bring life to be. And yet, in July of 2002, her insurance premiums more than doubled. See, the litigation culture made it nearly impossible for her to practice her love. I say nearly impossible, because she would not break her commitments to expecting patients and hung in there for a year. But her premiums continued to rise, and Dr. McBee has stopped delivering babies, as a direct result of too many junk lawsuits, and that is not right. That is not right. Let me give you another story. Dr. John Wilson is with us. Dr. Wilson is a good soul. He is an orthopedist from Little Rock, Arkansas. He is been practicing medicine for-I think he said 35 years, 30 of which he was not hassled by lawsuits. In other words, what we are talking about is a new phenomenon here in society-in this society. He is a-he believes that doctors are called to serve. Besides just healing people, they are called to serve people. And I bet you when you talk to most docs, that is the way they feel as well. So he traveled every week to the Arkansas Delta. And for people who are not familiar with Arkansas, that is a poor, rural area that, frankly, does not have enough doctors. And he heard a calling. So he would go there to help-to love, really, if you think about it-to practice his talent and skills and to love people by helping them, and then he got sued. And the lawsuits were dropped, but he was unable to find insurance because he was told if he kept going over there, the cost of his business, the cost of being a doctor, would rise dramatically. And so he quit going. He quit going. By the way, I went to Mississippi a while ago and talked to a doc who was there in the Mississippi Delta. He came down from another State to practice medicine. He understood there is a lot of poor people there; he wanted to help them. He got sued-for helping poor people, because he is a doctor. And guess what? He left. The Wilson story and the story I just mentioned to you, it is just all too common. And people get affected. These junk lawsuits not only are running up the cost of medicine; they are making the quality of life of some of our citizens-diminishing the quality of life. Sully and Mary Ligon are with us. They are from Helena-or Henrietta? Mrs. Ligon. It is Helena. The President. Helena, yes, Helena. How quickly we forget. Anyway, see, the Ligons got help from Dr. Wilson. She was telling me she got injured during one Christmas and tore a rotator cuff, and Dr. Wilson being the good doc he is, fixed it. Her fastball is back up to about 85 miles an hour now. But Dr. Wilson no longer goes there. And Sully got knocked over by a cow. He said a wild cow, not a mad cow. He got hurt, see. And Dr. Wilson was their doc because he used to go there. He no longer goes there. So guess what? The Ligons now have to drive here. And as they were quick to point out, they can afford to do so, which is good. It is inconvenient as heck, but they can afford to do so. There is a lot of people there that cannot , and they are missing out on a good doc. And the reason Dr. Wilson is not there is because lawsuits are running up the cost of medicine, make it hard for him to practice. His heart's right. Trust me. I heard him. But he just cannot go there. There is just too many junk and frivolous lawsuits. We need to do something about it for the sake of a lot of people. I met with Frank Wise. He is from Fulton County Hospital. It is a rural hospital. These junk lawsuits have raised the cost of delivering babies such that they no longer do so in his hospital. And he tells the story about people desperately looking for a place to- for a bed, and babies being delivered on a bridge. Listen, I am going to tell you something. We can have balance in our society when it comes to having a good legal system and a good medical system. It is not that way today. The pendulum has swung way, way too far. D'Borai Lynn Cook-you might have heard of her if you work here. She is the emergency room case manager. She sees firsthand what it means to practice medicine defensively. She says they over-prescribe to cover themselves to make sure that, as they do their job, they are thinking about what would happen if they end up in a court of law. She says that-she said then there is the negative aspect of defensive medicine with people saying, I am not going to handle that case. See, too many lawsuits affect the lives of a lot of good people, and we need to do something about it. And so I proposed to the Congress to act. My job as the President, if I see problems, is to address them square on, and I expect Congress to do the same thing. I expect Congress to do the same. First of all, we want to make sure the court system is uncluttered. We want to make sure that if a person is injured, they have their day in court. Frivolous and junk lawsuits make it hard for those who get injured to have their day in court, for starters. And secondly, obviously, if they have been hurt by a bad doc, there needs to be a judgment, and that person needs to be able to recover the cost of their care, the recovery, and the economic losses for the rest of their life. Every good doc wants to make sure that the legal system works fairly. Good docs are not afraid to stand up in a court of law. They just do not want to be run out of business because of these junk lawsuits, just filing suit after suit after suit. People ought to be allowed to recover economic damages. But for the sake of a strong health care system, for the sake of making sure health care is accessible and affordable, we need a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages. States that have got a hard cap have seen positive results, have seen the judicial system work well and the medical field stay vibrant. And if harm is caused by truly egregious behavior, patients should be able to recover reasonable punitive damages. What I propose is fair, see. I have laid out something that is balanced and fair, something that addresses a critical national need, and that is the cost of medicine. The problem is, is that some in the United States Senate do not see it that way. That bill I put up there passed the House of Representatives, and it is stuck in the Senate. And your Senators need to hear from you about a balanced, fair system. For the sake of Arkansas and States around the country, you need medical liability reform. We need to make sure we have got joint and several liability reform as well. See, what happens is some of these junk lawsuits, they will just file against everybody. Even though they may not be like 100-percent responsible for an issue, they will have to pay 100 percent of the cost. That is not fair. That hurts hospitals in particular and a lot of docs as well. There needs to be good reform. There just needs to be good, sound national reform that is fair and balanced and full of common sense. The House passed a bill. It is stuck in the Senate. These Senators have got to understand no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit. And I am going to stay on the issue until we get it fixed. This is a national problem. Let me talk about one other issue, and then I will let you get back to work. Today I met Mary Lynn Roberson at the airport. Mary Lynn has volunteered-she is right there. I told her I was going to say her name. Thank you, Mary Lynn. She has volunteered here for nearly three decades. She visits with family and friends of surgery patients. In other words, she is spreading love, is what she is doing. And the reason I bring that up, and her work, is because the true strength of America is the fact that there are Mary Lynns in every community who are willing to take time out of their personal life to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. We are a mighty nation when it comes to our military, and we will keep it that way. We are a mighty nation when it comes to wealth in our economy, and it is getting better. But the most mighty aspect of our Nation is the fact that our citizens, from all walks of life, care deeply about a neighbor in need. One of the most compelling things about being the President is I get to see on a daily basis the true compassion of our fellow citizens. And I hear just unbelievably fantastic stories about people overcoming big odds, because a neighbor is helped. Somebody has just taken time out of their life to make a difference. My call to the good people of Little Rock is to work with the Boy Scouts-and I thank you for being involved in such a values-based program-or to start a program in your house of worship to feed the hungry or find shelter for the homeless. If you are interested in helping make a difference, mentor a child, teach a child how to read. What a fantastic gift that is to teach a child to read. After all, I like to say reading is the new civil right. And you can help. The strength of this country is the fact that we are a compassionate country. And there are thousands of people who are soldiers in the army of compassion, working hard to change lives, just like you are doing here at this hospital. I am so grateful that you gave me a chance to come by and talk about issues of national concern. I am particularly grateful for the love you show for people who hurt here in society. This country is a great country because it is full of great people. I am honored to be here. May God bless your work, and may God continue to bless America. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslittlerockarkansas2", "title": "Remarks in Little Rock, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-little-rock-arkansas-2", "publication_date": "26-01-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 741, "text": "Please all be seated, and I want to thank all of you, Senator Paula Hawkins, Congressman Ireland, Congressman Connie Mack McCollum, the distinguished people here, and Mr. and Mrs. Eisner, all of you ladies and gentlemen, and these wonderful young people. We have come here our first stop this morning on this Decoration Day was at Arlington Cemetery and I just wonder if because of the special character of this day, Memorial Day, if we could not perhaps bow our heads for a few seconds in silent prayer for those who have given their lives that we might live in liberty. Well, indeed it is an honor for me to be here today to receive a magnificent gift that I received on a second and very much warmer Inauguration Day. I understand that in preparing for this event more than 2,500 young people worked with sponsors in the private sector who donated food, transportation, and lodging. And each of you who helped to make this private sector initiative possible has my heartfelt thanks. Tomorrow evening I will address the Nation about a dramatic proposal to reform our tax system. It is a proposal intended to launch a new American revolution and to give to you young people, as you come of age, a nation of ever-greater freedom and vitality and strength. You know, today we are enjoying a standard of living that, when I was your age, could not even have been imagined. Buoyed by medical breakthroughs and rising standards of living, the life expectancy of Americans has been increasing steadily for 50 years. I have already surpassed my own life expectancy at my birth by 20 years. Now, there are a lot of people that find that a source of annoyance, but I appreciate it very much. Today we take for granted so many inventions that inspired wonder not long ago the polio vaccines of Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin; television, first in black and white and now in vivid color; drought-resistant seeds and cold-resistant grains; computers in the workplace and the home; spacecraft that can orbit the Earth for days and then land gently on a desert runway. Despite the predictions so many made during the Great Depression when I was a young man, life in America today is not worse it is far better. And let us ask, then, what made it so? Was it government directing our daily lives? During these past five decades the Government has indeed provided vital services and helped improve life for many people. No one doubts the necessity of a strong national defense or the role our military has played in keeping us free. Likewise no one doubts the importance of the government safety net for those in genuine need. Yet our national experience shows that when government grows beyond these two limited duties, when government lays claim to more and more of our resources and begins, through massive regulation and high taxation, to impinge on our individual freedoms, then our economy grows not more prosperous but less so. Throughout the 1970's, for example, government's growth was unbridled, yet our economy stagnated. By 1980 the gross national product registered zero growth. If it was not the Government that spurred our economic growth was it perhaps our natural resources? Our vast land has always been blessed by a mighty multitude of resources broad plains, powerful rivers, and rich deposits of minerals. Yet in a sense, the primary reality of a resource exists not in the earth but in the minds of the men and women who give it usefulness and value. Consider oil. A century ago oil was nothing but a thick, foul, and useless liquid. It was the invention of the internal combustion engine that gave oil its function. Or think of sand, sand that used to be nothing but the stuff that deserts are made of. The development of the silicon microchip has given sand a vital function. And today we use it to make chips that give home computers their intelligence, monitor functions on aircraft, and guide our satellites through the dark reaches of space. No, it is not been so much our resources or our government that have given us our enduring vibrancy and growth but the initiative and enterprise of individual Americans. Air travel, for example, has become commonplace because test pilots like Lindbergh had daring, and engineers like Boeing and Douglas had the wits and determination. The Government might have wished it could simply decree a polio vaccine, but it took years of unremitting effort and dedication by Doctors Salk and Sabin to make the vaccines a reality. In this setting, one story of a private initiative is particularly appropriate. Back in Missouri in the early 1900's there lived a farmboy who discovered that he had a knack for drawing barnyard animals. As an adult, he began to put his animals into cartoons, and he became convinced that he could entertain people by telling stories about a little creature with a high voice, red trousers, and yellow shoes and white gloves. Professionals in the field made fun of the idea, and to produce his first cartoons the young man had to sell or pawn virtually everything he owned. But today, 57 years later, this man and his creation have become permanently fixed in the history of our popular culture. His name was Walt Disney; his little creature was Mickey Mouse. The determination that each of these heroes of progress demonstrated came from within. Yet in each case it was crucial to the success of their efforts that they were operating in a climate of economic liberty in a free market where they could make use of pooled resources, experiment with new techniques and products, and submit their plans and hypotheses to the test of practical experience. This aspect of freedom, economic freedom, is one of the distinctive characteristics of life in our nation, as interwoven into the American legacy as freedom of speech and press. It has enabled our people to make our nation into a marvel of economic progress, and, as with all the freedoms that we enjoy, it is our duty to cherish and protect it. Just as the American people rebelled against oppressive taxation some two centuries ago, the reform that I will announce tomorrow will represent a dramatic effort to make our tax code more simple, efficient, and fair and place more resources into the hands of your families and, ultimately, you yourselves. It will expand our economic freedom and clear the way for even greater economic vitality than that which we enjoy today. Nor will the benefits be economic alone. With more resources at their disposal, the American people will be able to provide greater support to the institutions that they themselves value our schools, universities, the arts, our churches and synagogues. As our economy grows they, too, will flourish. John Marshall said, The power to tax involves the power to destroy. If so, then the power to cut taxes must surely be the power to create the power to force government to stand back and let the people themselves give expression to the spirit of enterprise building and imagining; giving to you, our sons and daughters, a nation of ever-greater prosperity and freedom. My friends, thank you again for the gift of this magnificent inaugural parade. May you enjoy all the blessings of a free and bountiful nation, and on this, the eve of the second American revolution, may you always remember the enduring truth that our tax plan seeks to embody and that Americans have cherished through the ages God made man for liberty. Thank you all, God bless you, and now, let the parade begin.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksparticipantsthepresidentsinauguralbandsparadewaltdisneysepcotcenternear", "title": "Remarks to Participants in the President's Inaugural Bands Parade at Walt Disney's EPCOT Center Near Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-participants-the-presidents-inaugural-bands-parade-walt-disneys-epcot-center-near", "publication_date": "27-05-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 601, "text": "On the eve of another election, I have come home to Hyde Park and am sitting at my own fireside in my own election district, my own County and my own State. I have often expressed my feeling that the mere fact that I am President should not disqualify me from expressing as a citizen my views on candidates and issues in my own State. I have changed my mind about the nature of some problems of democratic government over the past few years as I have had more and more experience with them. I had never realized how much my way of thinking had changed until the other day when I was watching the finishing touches being put on a simple cottage I have recently built-a little cottage which, by the way, is not in any sense of the word a dream house. Just watching the building go up made me realize that there was a time not so long ago when I used to think about problems of government as if they were the same kind of problems as building a house-definite and compact and capable of completion within a given time. Now I know well that the comparison is not a good one. Once you build a house you always have it. On the other hand, a social or an economic gain is a different matter. A social or an economic gain made by one Administration, for instance, may, and often does, evaporate into thin air under the next Administration. We all remember well known examples of what an ill-advised shift from liberal to conservative leadership can do to an incompleted liberal program. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, started a march of progress during his seven years in the Presidency but, after four years of President Taft, little was left of the progress that had been made. Think of the great liberal achievements of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom and how quickly they were liquidated under President Harding. We have to have reasonable continuity in liberal government in order to get permanent results. The whole United States concedes that we in the State of New York have carried out a magnificent liberal program through our State government during the past sixteen years. If the continuity of that liberal government had been broken in this State during that time, we would be nowhere near the point we have reached today. The voters throughout the country should remember that need for continuous liberal government when they vote next Tuesday. On that day in every state the oldest of modern democracies will hold an election. A free people will have a free choice to pick free leaders for free men. In other lands across the water the flares of militarism and conquest, terrorism and intolerance, have vividly revealed to Americans for the first time since the Revolution how precious and extraordinary it is to be allowed this free choice of free leaders for free men. No one next Tuesday will order us how to vote, and the only watchers we shall find at the polls are the watchers who guarantee that our ballot is secret. Think how few places are left where this can happen. But we cannot carelessly assume that a nation is strong and great merely because it has a democratic form of government. We have learned that a democracy weakened by internal dissension, by mutual suspicion born of social injustice, is no match for autocracies which are ruthless enough to repress internal dissension. Democracy in order to live must become a positive force in the daily lives of its people. It must make men and women whose devotion it seeks, feel that it really cares for the security of every individual; that it is tolerant enough to inspire an essential unity among its citizens; and that it is militant enough to maintain liberty against social oppression at home and against military aggression abroad. The rest of the world is far closer to us in every way than in the days of democracy's founders-Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln. Comparisons in this world are unavoidable. To disprove the pretenses of rival systems, democracy must be an affirmative, up-to-date conception. It can no longer be negative-no longer adopt a defeatist attitude. In these tense and dangerous situations in the world, democracy will save itself with the average man and woman by proving itself worth saving. Too many of those who prate about saving democracy are really only interested in saving things as they were. Democracy should concern itself also with things as they ought to be. I am not talking mere idealism; I am expressing realistic necessity. I reject the merely negative purposes proposed by old-line Republicans and Communists alike-for they are people whose only purpose is to survive against any other Fascist threat than their own. As of today, Fascism and Communism-and old-line Tory Republicanism-are not threats to the continuation of our form of government. But I venture the challenging statement that if American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force, seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens, then Fascism and Communism, aided, unconsciously perhaps, by old-line Tory Republicanism, will grow in strength in our land. It will take cool judgment for our people to appraise the repercussions of change in other lands. And only a nation completely convinced-at the bottom as well as at the top-that their system of government best serves their best interests, will have such a cool judgment. And while we are developing that coolness of judgment, we need in public office, above all things, men wise enough to avoid passing incidents where passion and force try to substitute themselves for judgment and negotiation. During my four years as Governor of the State of New York and during my nearly six years as President, I am proud of the fact that I have never called out the armed forces of the State or Nation except on errands of mercy. That type of democratic wisdom was illustrated last year by the action of Governor Murphy of Michigan when he persuaded the negotiators of the employers and employees to sit around a table. Thus he got an agreement, avoided bloodshed, and earned the praise of both sides of a controversy that had frightened a whole nation. With such an approach, the New Deal, keeping its feet on the ground, is working out hundreds of current problems from day to day as necessities arise and with whatever materials are at hand. We are doing this without attempting to commit the Nation to any ism or any ideology except democracy, humanity and the civil liberties which form their foundations. Our economic and social system cannot deny the paramount right of the millions who toil and the millions who wish to toil, to have it function smoothly and efficiently. After all, any such system must provide efficiently for distributing national resources and serving the welfare and happiness of all who live under it. The modern interdependent industrial and agricultural society which we live in is like a large factory. Each member of the organization has his own job to perform on the assembly line, but if the conveyor belt breaks or gets tangled up, no one in the factory, no matter how hard he tries, can do his own particular job. Each of us-farmer, business man or worker-suffers when anything goes wrong with the conveyor belt. If our democracy is to survive it must give the average man reasonable assurance that the belt will be kept moving. Dictators have recognized that problem. They keep the conveyor belt moving-but at a terrible price to the individual and to his civil liberty. The New Deal has been trying to keep those belts moving without paying such a price. It does not wish to run or manage any part of our economic machine which private enterprise can run and keep running. That should be left to individuals, to corporations, to any other form of private management, with profit for those who manage well. But when an abuse interferes with the ability of private enterprise to keep the national conveyor belt moving, government has a responsibility to eliminate that abuse. We do not assume for a minute that all we have done is right or all that we have done has been successful, but our economic and social program of the past five and a half years has definitely given to the United States of America a more stable and less artificial prosperity than any other nation in the world has enjoyed in that period. The very fact that the business slump that began last fall and kept running into last summer did not become a major economic disaster, like the terrible slump that ran from 1929 all the way through to 1933, is the best kind of proof that fundamentally we have found the right track. You have just heard the news about the automobile factories and many other industries that are opening up for full employment again. And during the month of October alone over-all employment has risen nearly 3 1/2 per cent. I have been very happy in the last six months to see how swiftly a large majority of businessmen have been coming around to accept the objectives of a more stable economy and of certain necessary supervision of private activities in order to prevent a return of the serious abuses and conditions of the past. But if there should be any weakening of the power of a liberal government next Tuesday, it would resurrect false hopes on the part of some businessmen who are now beginning to change antiquated ideas, hopes that if they can hold out just a little longer no adaptation to change will be necessary. There is no doubt of the basic desires of the American people. And because these basic desires are well known you find all parties, all candidates, making the same general promises to satisfy these desires. During the weeks before a general election, all parties are the friends of labor, all parties are against monopoly, all parties say that the unemployed must have work or be given government relief, and all parties love the farmer. Let me warn you now, as I warned you two years ago in my address at Syracuse, against the type of smooth evasion which says: Of course we believe all these things; we believe in social security; we believe in work for the unemployed; we believe in saving homes. Cross our hearts and hope to die, we believe in all these things; but we do not like the way the present Administration is doing them. Just turn them over to us. We will do all of them-we will do more of them-we will do them better; and, most important of all, the doing of them will not cost anybody anything. But when democracy struggles for its very life, those same people obstruct our efforts to maintain it, while they fail to offer proof of their own will and their own plans to preserve it. They try to stop the only fire engine we have from rushing to the fire because they are sales agents for a different make of fire engine. New ideas cannot be administered successfully by men with old ideas, for the first essential of doing a job well is the wish to see the job done at all. Judge parties and candidates, not merely by what they promise, but by what they have done, by their records in office, by the kind of people they travel with, by the kind of people who finance and promote their campaigns. By their promoters ye shall know them. No national administration, however much it may represent the genuine popular will of the people, can in the long run prove enduringly effective if that administration can be cut off from the people by state and local political machinery controlled by men who are hostile. My own State of New York is to choose a Governor. Ours is the most complex state in the Union-thirteen million population, great farming areas, hundreds of small communities, one huge city of seven million people, and many other cities, great and small. In 1918, twenty years ago, when I was thirty-six years old, I was invited to run for the Governorship of this State. I was then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. I declined the offer, because my job required me at that time to sail on a destroyer for overseas service. I am glad I did, for, looking back on that time, I do not think that I had experience and knowledge of public affairs wide enough to qualify as Governor. Besides, I did not think it quite right to abandon in mid-stream an important public job that I had undertaken. Governing the State of New York is more than being an Assistant Secretary of the Navy or a local District Attorney. The Governor of this State is called upon to administer eighteen great departments of government and to supervise state institutions that house over one hundred thousand wards of the State. He must be able to understand, and handle the vast and intricate problems of agriculture. He is charged with the supervision of State finance and the maintenance of the State credit. He is responsible for its widespread system of roads, parks, canals, bridges and schools. He has to maintain, preserve and improve the great body of social legislation already on the statute books of the State-unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation, social security, help for the needy and the underprivileged; and he must see to it that these recent reforms are made to keep pace with the broadening conception of social justice. Equal protection of the law- criminal and civil- for human rights as well as property rights; prosecution of criminals in high financial places as well as in low places; the preservation of civil and religious liberties-all these precious essentials of civilization are entrusted to him. New York has State laws matching every progressive Federal measure of the last five years. They were all enacted under the guiding hand and driving energy of Governor Herbert H. Lehman. Recruits in the battle for economic democracy are always welcome irrespective of party; but at a critical moment in the world's history we cannot take the risk of supplanting seasoned leaders like Governor Lehman with men, no matter how sincere, who have yet to win their spurs or prove what they really know or where they really stand in the fight for social justice. Those who truly and sincerely join the struggle for social justice, economic democracy for its own sake, do not throw stones at veteran fighters in that cause. No one can properly minimize the need of active law enforcement, whether it be in-a great city or in the rural counties of this or any other state. Certainly Governor Lehman has never minimized it, and has never hesitated to call to his assistance in law enforcement, young and vigorous prosecutors, irrespective of politics. We need more active law enforcement, not only against the lords of the underworld, but also against the lords of the over world. It is right-wholly right-to prosecute criminals. But that is not enough, for there is the immense added task of working for the elimination of present and future crime by getting rid of evil social conditions which breed crime. Good government can prevent a thousand crimes for every one it punishes. The fight for social justice and economic democracy has not the allure of a criminal jury trial; it is a long, weary, uphill struggle- and those who give themselves unsparingly to it are seldom acclaimed at my lady's tea or at my gentleman's club. As a resident and voter in the State of New York I urge my fellow citizens and voters, who are interested in preserving good government and American democracy, to vote for Herbert H. Lehman. Just as a Governor is required to be much more than a good prosecutor, so a United States Senator must be much more than a good lawyer. A Senator from New York must do more than merely vote on whatever bills happen to drift by. He must be able and willing to take the initiative-to keep the legislative wheels turning in the right direction. If you were to list some of the newly recognized major responsibilities of government to meet the complexities of modern. life-security in old age, unemployment insurance, protection of the rights of labor, low-cost housing, and slum clearance you would have a virtual resume of the Acts of the Congress that bear the name of Robert F. Wagner. So often since 1933 has new legislation been described as The Wagner Act that the phrase has become confusing because there have been so many Wagner Acts. For example, there is not only the Wagner Labor Relations Act; there are the Wagner Social Security Act and the Wagner Housing Act; and although you might feel uncertain as to which particular Act is meant by the phrase, you can feel no uncertainty as to this-that any one of the Wagner Acts was an Act intended for the benefit of those who need the help and support of government against oppression and against intolerable conditions of living. His name stands in our history for courageous and intelligent leadership, constructive statecraft and steadfast devotion to the common man and the cause of civil liberties. With him I hope the voters of this State will send to the Senate in Washington an experienced Member of the House of Representatives-James M. Mead-known through many years for his expert knowledge of three fields whose intricate problems press heavily upon government today-railroads, aviation and Civil Service, and for his unflagging support of every liberal measure that has come before the Congress. We need that legislative experience, that temper of mind, that expert knowledge in the United States Senate. Look over the rest of the names on the ballot next Tuesday. Pick those who are known for their experience and their liberalism. Pick them for what they have done, and not just for what they say they might do. And one last but important word: Pick them without regard to race, color or creed. Some of them may have come of the earliest Colonial stock; some of them may have been brought here as children to escape the tyrannies of the Old World. But remember that all of them are good American citizens now. Remember that the Fathers of the American Revolution represented many religions and came from many foreign lands. Remember that no matter what their origin they all agreed with Benjamin Franklin in that crisis: We must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately. Remember that in these grave days in the affairs of the world we need internal unity-national unity.

{"id": 776, "text": "Members of the Congress, Secretary Ray Donovan, our distinguished guests sharing the platform with me, and you ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to the White House. I am delighted to help kick off this 1984 summer youth employment program. And I want to congratulate all the Presidential Certificate Award winners for their dedication to the career development of America's youth and for their generous support of the 1983 private sector jobs program. It is times like this that remind us America was built by people helping people. We are proud to honor you this morning. And I hope that next year your numbers will grow. Would not it be great if we had to hold this out on the South Lawn could not get it in the Rose Garden anymore. Many of you will recall that last July we held a similar ceremony right here in the Rose Garden. And since then, more than 3 million Americans have found jobs. In fact, since the economic expansion began 17 months ago, 5.4 million Americans have found jobs, and the unemployment rate has shown the sharpest drop or the steepest drop in 30 years. Now, that is why when I am asked to describe our economic program I do it with three words jobs, jobs, jobs. But we cannot rest until everyone who wants one and needs one has one. We must and will go forward to keep opportunities expanding, particularly for the young people of America. No single sector of our nation-government, business, labor, or nonprofit organization-can solve the unemployment problem, the needs of our young people. But by working together, pooling our resources and building on our strengths, we can accomplish great things. That is the whole idea behind our youth employment programs' public-private partnerships-to produce real, not make-work, jobs. Partnerships take advantage of opportunities to help America's youth gain a foothold on the economic ladder. Young people who want to work in the summer deserve the chance, and partnerships can make it happen. The summer youth employment program includes a $725 million block grant to State and local governments. This grant will give 718,000 young Americans valuable work experience, but it is only part of our effort to help deserving young people get a start. Another program in place gives employers who hire economically disadvantaged teenagers a tax credit of up to 85 percent of the wages paid. The employers get a young employee the company may not be able to afford without the tax break, and the young worker gets a needed job and valuable work experience in the private sector. Mr. Austin Cunningham of Orangeburg, South Carolina, who is with us today, can tell you how well the targeted jobs tax credit program works. After he discovered the program, Mr. Cunningham promoted the idea to 77 other small business men and women in Orangeburg. Together, they hired 264 economically disadvantaged young people. For most of these 16- and 17- year-olds it was their first real job. And when the summer was over, many of them were asked to stay on full-time even though the tax credit no longer applied. Now, that is partnership in action, and everybody's better off because of it. What we are trying to do is help our young people find that critical first job. With experience in the workplace, America's youth can develop skills and demonstrate their qualifications and potential-permanent employers. But far too often, inexperienced and disadvantaged young people are priced out of the labor market by the minimum wage. Well, Ray Donovan and a lot of other people here today have put together legislation that will give a much-needed boost to those looking for that first job. Today I will submit our youth employment opportunity wage act to the Congress. And Senators Percy and Hatch and Congressman Packard, who have worked hard on this bill, will introduce it on the Hill in behalf of the administration and the American people. This legislation would allow employers to hire young people at a lower minimum wage during the summer months. The bill would increase summer employment opportunities and provide explicit safeguards to protect permanent employees and sanctions to prevent abuse. Now, I am delighted that the National Conference of Black Mayors has endorsed the concept of the youth employment opportunity wage. And now that Mayor Johnny Ford, the past president, and Mayor Marion Barry, the current president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, have endorsed this legislation, maybe we can help Chuck, Orrin, and Ron get this important jobs initiative approved by the Congress. While I have the chance, I want to thank Bill Kolberg and all the other executives of the National Alliance of Business for their continuing support in coordinating the summer jobs program. The White House Office of Private Sector Initiatives and the NAB have done an outstanding job in leading this year's effort. And thanks to the support of other business, community, and State and local agencies, we are reaching out and responding to the needs of our young people. Councils like the Greater Kansas City Alliance of Business are using innovative ideas and modern marketing techniques to develop thousands of summer jobs. Companies like Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, Chevron, the American Council of Life Insurance have donated generously to meet the challenge. Television stations like WTVJ in Miami, KPIX in San Francisco, have held job-athons. WPIX-TV is leading a very successful summer jobs program for New York City. Small business men and women all across America are opening their hearts and their business doors to American youth. And thousands of caring Americans, like Roosevelt Grier and Dave Winfield, who hit a two-run homer in the 10th last night- -are with us today pitching in to help make this year's program the best ever. Yes, America is reaching out with a gift of opportunity, and that is a gift that'll last a lifetime. But there are still far too many young people, particularly disadvantaged and minority youth, who cannot find summer employment. We can and must help them get the chance they so richly deserve. Let me close by asking America's business men and women two questions. Do you remember your first job? Do you remember the lucky break you received even though you were inexperienced and the only skills you had were enthusiasm and determination? I can remember mine. I was 14. It was summer, and there I was with a pick and shovel. And you do learn things, not only about using that pick and shovel. I remember one day, all morning, I'd been swinging that pick. And I had it up for another swing when the noon whistle blew. And I just felt, That is it, and I just let go and stepped out from under it and let it fall behind me. And then I heard some very strong language immediately to my rear. And I turned around, and the boss was standing there, and the pick was embedded in the ground right between his feet. And I learned, if you get that thing up there, swing it. Well, it is your turn now to offer the same opportunity, and you will never regret it. And thank you, and God bless you all for being here. And I was not acting at all. But then there were some who said that I was not before.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswhitehouseceremonymarkingthebeginningthesummeryouthemploymentprogram", "title": "Remarks at a White House Ceremony Marking the Beginning of the Summer Youth Employment Program", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-white-house-ceremony-marking-the-beginning-the-summer-youth-employment-program", "publication_date": "17-05-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 941, "text": "Thank You. I want to thank King Salman for his extraordinary words, and the magnificent Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for hosting today's summit. I am honored to be received by such gracious hosts. I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived. You also hosted me in the treasured home of King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom who united your great people. Working alongside another beloved leader - American President Franklin Roosevelt - King Abdulaziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. King Salman: your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy - and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens. Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine. I stand before you as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith. In my inaugural address to the American People, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust. Our vision is one of peace, security, and prosperity-in this region, and in the world. Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God. And so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leaders-unique in the history of nations-is a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce. For Americans, this is an exciting time. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country: in just a few months, we have created almost a million new jobs, added over 3 trillion dollars of new value, lifted the burdens on American industry, and made record investments in our military that will protect the safety of our people and enhance the security of our wonderful friends and allies - many of whom are here today. Now, there is even more blessed news I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King Salman, the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia. This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase - and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies. This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a greater role in security operations. We have also started discussions with many of the countries present today on strengthening partnerships, and forming new ones, to advance security and stability across the Middle East and beyond. Later today, we will make history again with the opening of a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology - located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you. America is a sovereign nation and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lecture-we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership - based on shared interests and values - to pursue a better future for us all. Here at this summit we will discuss many interests we share together. But above all we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history's great test-to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples. God's help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East - and maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared its violent reach. America has suffered repeated barbaric attacks - from the atrocities of September 11th to the devastation of the Boston Bombing, to the horrible killings in San Bernardino and Orlando. The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and even South America. India, Russia, China and Australia have been victims. But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim. We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure. The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams. The Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity. This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock. Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world's great faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones-including soaring achievements in architecture. Egypt was a thriving center of learning and achievement thousands of years before other parts of the world. The wonders of Giza, Luxor and Alexandria are proud monuments to that ancient heritage. All over the world, people dream of walking through the ruins of Petra in Jordan. Iraq was the cradle of civilization and is a land of natural beauty. And the United Arab Emirates has reached incredible heights with glass and steel, and turned earth and water into spectacular works of art. The entire region is at the center of the key shipping lanes of the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz. The potential of this region has never been greater. 65 percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home. But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it. Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism's devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing-then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between Good and Evil. When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims - we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong - and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you - in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children. It is a choice between two futures - and it is a choice America CANNOT make for you. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH. For our part, America is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not worked-and will apply new approaches informed by experience and judgment. We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests. Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes - not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms - not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection-and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, America seeks peace - not war. Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil. Many are already making significant contributions to regional security: Jordanian pilots are crucial partners against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and a regional coalition have taken strong action against Houthi militants in Yemen. The Lebanese Army is hunting ISIS operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. Emirati troops are supporting our Afghan partners. In Mosul, American troops are supporting Kurds, Sunnis and Shias fighting together for their homeland. Qatar, which hosts the U.S. Central Command, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban, and others, in the fight for their country. As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let ISIS sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements. I am proud to announce that the nations here today will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center - co-chaired by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and joined by every member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It is another historic step in a day that will be long remembered. I also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror, and designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization last year. Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing sanctions on one of the most senior leaders of Hezbollah. Of course, there is still much work to do. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory - piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and YOUR SOUL WILL BE CONDEMNED. And political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: heroes do not kill innocents; they save them. Many nations here today have taken important steps to raise up that message. Saudi Arabia's Vision for 2030 is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development. The United Arab Emirates has also engaged in the battle for hearts and souls-and with the U.S., launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. Bahrain too is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism. I also applaud Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees leaving the Middle East depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions. That means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life - including women, children, and followers of all faiths. Numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens Arab and Muslim communities. For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims and Jews living side-by-side. We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once again-and make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope. In that spirit, after concluding my visit in Riyadh, I will travel to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and then to the Vatican - visiting many of the holiest places in the three Abrahamic Faiths. If these three faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible - including peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all three-safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of Iran. From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. Among Iran's most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Assad Regime - launching 59 tomahawk missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region. The Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims are its own people. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders' reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve. The decisions we make will affect countless lives. King Salman, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investment in America, its industry and its jobs. I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world. This fertile region has all the ingredients for extraordinary success - a rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise. But you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror and violence. We in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers, and for action. And when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice. Today, billions of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time. Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on earth? If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bring-more suffering and despair. But if we act-if we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the world-then there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have. The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what tomorrow could bring. Glorious wonders of science, art, medicine and commerce to inspire humankind. Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns. New jobs and industries that will lift up millions of people. Parents who no longer worry for their children, families who no longer mourn for their loved ones, and the faithful who finally worship without fear. These are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved peoples. I ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to FIGHT together- BECAUSE UNITED, WE WILL NOT FAIL. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless Your Countries. And God Bless the United States of America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementspresidenttrumpsspeecharabislamicamericansummitutmsourcelinkutmmediumheader", "title": "President Trump's Speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit", "source": "https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-trumps-speech-arab-islamic-american-summit/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header", "publication_date": "21-05-2017", "crawling_date": "27-06-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 705, "text": "Hello, New York! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jonathan, for your service to this country and for continuing to fight for what this country stands for, even after you had to take off the uniform. I also want to recognize the extraordinary performance of Audra McDonald. I like hearing her sing. I want to thank our emcee for this evening, Neil Patrick Harris. Everybody knows that Neil is openly terrific. Couple of other acknowledgments: Christine Quinn, the New York City council speaker, is here; a great friend of mine who helped move the process forward to make sure that do not ask, do not tell got done, Patrick Murphy is in the house; the DNC treasurer, Andy Tobias, is here--I think they like you, Andy; and I want to thank the cochairs of the LGBT Leadership Council. Thank you so much. This is just an extraordinary event. It is wonderful to be back in New York. I see a lot of new faces, but also a lot of friends who I have known for a very long time. Many of you knew me before I had gray hair. Malia and Sasha says it makes me look distinguished; Michelle says it makes me look old. Now, being here with all of you, I cannot help but think back to election night 2 1/2 years ago. We were in Grant Park; some of you were there. Beautiful night. Culmination of an extraordinary journey, a campaign that had drawn on the hard work and support of people all across the country, men and women who believed that change was possible, who believed that we did not have to accept politics as usual, who believed that we could once again be a country that lived up to our highest aspirations, not our lowest common denominators. And it was a perfect night, and we were feeling pretty good, I got to admit. But what I said then at Grant Park was that this was not the end of the road, it was just the beginning. And I said that the journey was going to be long and it was going to be difficult and there were going to be times where we stumbled, that the climb was going to be steep. Now, we did not know exactly how steep it was going to be. But we knew that it was not going to be easy to rebuild the middle class after a decade of stagnant incomes and rising costs, a decade where a lot of Americans felt like that dream was slipping away. We knew it was not going to be easy to end two wars and restore America's leadership around the world. We knew it was not going to be easy to fix our immigration system, to reform our health care system, to transform our energy policy, to educate our young people for the demands of a global economy. We did not think it was going to be easy. And I said that night, I did not run for President to do easy things. I ran because I believed that as a nation it was time for us to do the hard things. It was time for us to do the big things, even if it took time, even if sometimes it was going to be frustrating. I said I was not going to let politics or the typical Washington games stand in our way, because it had held us back for too long. That is what led to the mess that we were dealing with in the first place. So over these past 2 1/2 years, I have had some tough calls to make. I had some tough calls as soon as I took office. We had to prevent a financial system from falling apart and dragging the economy into depression. We had to pass reforms to stop abuses in the financial system and prevent future crises. We had to rescue the auto industry. I did not think I was going to be an auto CEO. Even though there were a lot of people who said, let them go, let more than a million jobs vanish, allow two of America's iconic companies to be liquidated and sold off for parts, we said, no, we are going to have to step up, we are going to have to deal with it. But even as we took these emergency steps, we started tackling all the challenges that we had talked about during the campaign, all the things that were standing in the way of the American Dream. Because that is why I ran, that is what the campaign was about. That is why you supported me, because we believed in an economy that did not just work for those at the top, but worked for everybody, where prosperity was shared from the machinist on the line to the manager on the floor to the CEO in the boardroom. We worked so hard in 2008 because we believed that we have to define our success not just by stock prices or corporate profits, but whether ordinary folks can find a good job, whether they can afford a middle class life, whether they can pay the mortgage and take care of their kids and save some money for their child's college education or their own retirement and maybe have a little left over to go to a movie or dinner or even a play--since we are in New York. That is why we cut taxes for middle class families and ended subsidies to the banks for student loans to make college more affordable. That is why I was proud to sign a bill to make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, a basic principle. That is why we are promoting manufacturing and homegrown American energy, because that is what will lead to jobs that pay a decent salary. That is why we are standing up a new consumer bureau with just one responsibility: looking out for ordinary folks in the financial system so they are not cheated. That is why we passed health reform, so that nobody in the richest nation on Earth ever has to go bankrupt because they or somebody in their family get sick. That was the right thing to do. We waged that long campaign in 2008 because we believed it was time to end the war in Iraq. And that is what we are doing, ending the war in Iraq. We removed a hundred thousand troops from Iraq already, ended combat missions there. We are on track to bring the rest of our troops home by the end of this year. I ran for President because I believed we needed to refocus our efforts in Afghanistan, and we are doing this too. We pummeled Al Qaida. We took out bin Laden. And because of our progress and the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops, we are now fulfilling the commitment I made to start reducing our troops this month so that Afghans can take responsibility for their own security. I also ran because we now live in a world where America is facing stiff competition for good jobs. There are rapidly growing nations like China and India. They are hungry; they are on the move. And for a long time, we were told that the best way to win this competition was to undermine consumer protections, undermine clean air and clean water laws, hand out tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, and everything would work out just fine. It did not work out well. In fact, if you look at our history, you will see that philosophy has never worked out very well. America was built on the hard work of people and the ingenuity of our businesses. But we also built a system of free public high schools and sent a generation to college on the GI bill. We constructed railroads and highways that spanned a continent. We invested in research and technology, and we sent a man to the Moon, and we discovered lifesaving medicine. We launched the Information Age, creating millions of jobs along the way. That is how you build a nation. That is how you build a strong middle class. And that is what we need to do today. There is an important debate in Washington right now about cutting the deficit. And it is absolutely critical that we cut the deficit. Like families all across America, Government has to live within its means. And I am prepared to bring down our deficit by trillions of dollars; that is trillions with a t. But I will not reduce our deficit by sacrificing the education of our young people. We cannot stop medical research being done by our scientists. We cannot stop building the infrastructure that made this country great. I am not going to sacrifice clean energy at a time when our dependence on foreign oil has caused Americans so much pain at the pump. That does not make any sense. In other words, I will not sacrifice America's future. What makes America great is not just the scale of our skyscrapers or our military might or the size of our GDP. What makes us great is the character of our people. Yes, we are rugged individualists, and we are self-reliant, and that is part of what makes us Americans. We do not like being told what to do. But what also makes us who we are is we have got faith in the future and we recognize that that future is shared, the notion that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper. My life is richer and stronger when everybody in the country has some measure of security, everybody has got a fair shot at the American Dream. That is what makes us great. That is our vision for America. It is not a vision of a small America. It is a vision of a big America, a compassionate America, and a bold and optimistic America. And it is a vision where we are living within our means, but we are still investing in our future. And everybody is making sacrifices, but nobody bears all the burden. An America where we live up to the idea that no matter who we are, no matter what we look like, we are connected to one another. That is what led many of us to fight so hard, to knock on so many doors and maybe harangue some of our friends, this belief that it was up to each of us to perfect this Union. It was our work to make sure that we were living up to a simple American value: We are all created equal--all created equal. Ever since I entered into public life, ever since I have a memory about what my mother taught me and my grandparents taught me, I believed that discriminating against people was wrong. I had no choice; I was born that way----in Hawaii. And I believed that discrimination because of somebody's sexual orientation or gender identity ran counter to who we are as a people, and it is a violation of the basic tenets on which this Nation was founded. I believe that gay couples deserve the same legal rights as every other couple in this country. And that is --now, there was such a good recitation earlier by Neil that I feel bad repeating it, but let me just--it bears repeating. This is why we are making sure that hospitals extended visitation rights to gay couples, because nobody should be barred from their bedside because their partner--the bedside of their partner in a moment of pain or a moment of need. Nobody should have to produce a legal contract to hold the hand of the person that they love. It is why we launched the first comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy, providing a roadmap not only to providing treatment and reducing infections, but also embracing the potential of new, groundbreaking research that will help us bring an end to this pandemic. That is why I ordered Federal agencies to extend the same benefits to gay couples that go to straight couples wherever possible. It is why we are going to keep fighting until the law no longer---- Where was I? That is why we are going to keep on fighting until the law no longer treats committed partners who have been together for decades like they are strangers. That is why I have long believed that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act ought to be repealed. It was wrong. It was unfair. And since I taught constitutional law for a while, I felt like I was in a pretty good position to agree with courts that have ruled that section 3 of DOMA violates the Constitution. And that is why we decided, with my Attorney General, that we could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA in the courts. Now, part of the reason that DOMA does not make sense is that, traditionally, marriage has been decided by the States. And right now I understand there is a little debate going on here in New York----about whether to join five other States and DC in allowing civil marriage for gay couples. And I want to say that under the leadership of Governor Cuomo, with the support of Democrats and Republicans, New York is doing exactly what democracies are supposed to do. There is a debate; there is deliberation about what it means here in New York to treat people fairly in the eyes of the law. And that is--look, that is the power of our democratic system. It is not always pretty. There are setbacks. There are frustrations. But in grappling with tough and, at times, emotional issues in legislatures and in courts and at the ballot box, and yes, around the dinner table and in the office hallways, and sometimes even in the Oval Office, slowly but surely we find the way forward. That is how we will achieve change that is lasting, change that just a few years ago would have seemed impossible. Now, let me just say this. There were those who doubted that we'd be able to pass a hate crimes law. Occasionally, I got hollered at about that. After a decades-long fight, we got it done, bringing us closer to the day when nobody is going to be afraid to walk down the street because they are gay or transgender. There were those said we could not end do not ask, do not tell. And I remember having events where folks hollered out at events. But we passed the repeal. We got it done. We are now moving forward with implementing it. So we are no longer going to demand brave and patriotic Americans live a lie to serve their country. Folks like Captain Jonathan Hopkins, who led a platoon into northern Iraq during the initial invasion and quelled an ethnic riot and earned a Bronze Star with valor. He was discharged, only to receive e-mails and letters from his soldiers saying, if they had known he was gay all along--that they had known he was gay all along and they still thought he was the best commander they had ever had. That is how progress is being won here in New York, around the country. Day by day, it is won by ordinary people who are striving and fighting and protesting for change and who, yes, are keeping the pressure up, including pressure on me. And by men and women who are setting an example in their own lives: raising their families, doing their jobs, joining the PTA, singing in church, serving and sacrificing for this country overseas, even as they are not always granted the full rights of citizenship they deserve here at home. Last year, I received a letter from a teenager growing up in a small town, and he told me he was a senior in high school, and that he was proud to be the captain of a club at his school, and that he was gay. And he had not told his parents. He had not come out. He was worried about being mocked or being bullied. He did not think it was safe to, in his words, openly be myself. But this 17-year-old also looked towards the day when he did not have to be afraid, when he did not have to worry about walking down the hallway. And he closed his letter by saying: Everyone else is considered equal in this country. Why should not we be? So yes, we have more work to do. Yes, we have more progress to make. Yes, I expect continued impatience with me on occasion. But understand this--look, I think of teenagers like the one who wrote me, and they remind me that there should be impatience when it comes to the fight for basic equality. We have made enormous advances just in these last 2 1/2 years. But there are still young people out there looking for us to do more, to help build a world in which they never have to feel afraid or alone to be themselves. And we know how important that is to not only tell them that it is going to get better, but to also do everything in our power to ensure that things actually are better. I am confident that we will achieve the equality that this young person deserves. I am confident that the future is bright for that teenager and others like him and that he can have the life that he wants and that he imagines. There will be setbacks along the way. There will be times where things are not moving as fast as folks would like. But I know that he will look back on his struggles and the struggles of many in this room, as part of what made change possible, part of what it took to reach the day when every single American, gay or straight or lesbian or bisexual or transgender, was free to live and love as they see fit. And we can look at the progress we have made in the last 2 years, to the changes that were led not by Washington, but by folks standing up for themselves or for their sons or for their daughters, fighting for what is right. Not just change on behalf of gay Americans, but for everybody looking to fulfill their version of the American Dream. Whether it is the students working their way through college or the workers heading to factories to build American cars again or the energy entrepreneurs testing bold ideas, the construction crews laying down roads, the small-business owners and scientists and inventors and builders and all those Americans who faced hardship and setbacks, but who never stopped believing in this country, its capacity to change, who are helping each and every day to rebuild this Nation so that we emerge from this period of struggle stronger and more unified than ever before. And that is the story of progress in America--that is what all of you represent--of the stubborn refusal to accept anything less than the best that this country can be. And with your help, if you keep up the fight, and if you will devote your time and your energies to this campaign one more time, I promise you, we will write another chapter in that story. And we are going to leave a new generation with a brighter future and a more hopeful future. And I will be standing there, right there with you. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraisernewyorkcity4", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Fundraiser in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-national-committee-fundraiser-new-york-city-4", "publication_date": "23-06-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 736, "text": "Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate Mary Peters to be the next Secretary of Transportation. Our Nation's transportation infrastructure is vital to our prosperity and competitiveness; it is critical to the everyday lives of our citizens. The Secretary of Transportation is responsible for maintaining a safe, reliable, and efficient transportation system. In addition, the Secretary of Transportation plays an important role in our Nation's coordinated efforts to guard against terrorist threats to our aircraft, our seaports, and our infrastructure. It is the job that requires vision and strong leadership. Mary Peters is the right person for this job. She brings a lifetime of experience on transportation issues, from both the private and public sectors. She now serves as a senior executive for transportation policy at a major engineering firm. Before that, Mary served in my administration as the head of the Federal Highway Administration. As Administrator, Mary led efforts to improve safety and security, reduce traffic congestion, and modernize America's roads and bridges. And before coming to Washington, Mary served in the Arizona Department of Transportation for more than 15 years, rising through the ranks to become the director in 1998. Mary has a reputation for character and common sense. She is an innovative thinker. She knows how to set priorities and to solve problems. And as a member of my Cabinet, Mary will work closely with State and local leaders to ensure that America has a state-of-the-art transportation system that meets the needs of our growing economy. When confirmed by the Senate, Mary will succeed one of our Nation's finest Secretaries of Transportation in Norm Mineta. When I came to Washington, I asked Norm to continue his service by joining my Cabinet. And he shows that when we put politics aside, people from different political parties can work together to achieve results for the American people. He was the Secretary of Transportation on September the 11th, 2001, and he led the unprecedented effort to bring tens of thousands of passengers aboard commercial aircraft to safe landings. And since then, he is worked to strengthen the security at America's airports and seaports. He is played a critical role in keeping America safe from terrorist attacks. Norm also worked hard to modernize the aviation market. And after Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team swung into action to repair and reopen major highways and seaports and airports and pipelines along America's gulf coast. Norm Mineta has served America with integrity and dedication and distinction. He leaves office as the longest serving Secretary of Transportation in our Nation's history. I appreciate Norm's lifetime of service to our country. I wish him and Deni and all his family all the best. I also want to thank Maria Cino for her outstanding leadership of the Department since Norm stepped down in July. Mary Peters knows the legacy she has to live up to at the Department of Transportation. She will take this new post during a time of historic challenges for our economy and our transportation system. I want to thank Mary for her willingness to serve yet again. She is going to make an outstanding Secretary of Transportation, and I call upon the United States Senate to confirm her promptly. Congratulations.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenominationmaryepetersbesecretarytransportation", "title": "Remarks on the Nomination of Mary E.

{"id": 779, "text": "Governor Curley, Mr. Mayor, my friends of Boston. I return to the New England from which came most of my ancestors. I come from visiting many other States. Hardly one among them has not received men and treasure, brawn and brains, from New England's inexhaustible reserves. The average American as I have met him on these voyages is no longer indifferent to the problems of Government. And it is my opinion that there is more downright political intelligence than ever before in our entire history. In a world which in many places has gone undemocratic, we have gone more democratic. It is a bad sign for those who believe that the American people can be swept off their feet by rabble-rousers this year. The American mind today is above the rabble level. Two weeks from today, the day after election, the American air will be cleaner and American democracy will be safer. I want to speak to you briefly and simply about the prosperity of all the Nation, for in that prosperity all New England has an immediate and a direct interest. The golden State House dome symbolizes in itself the preservation of the political unity of the Nation. But New England is heir to the lasting fruits of another great New England tradition-the tradition of being a part in the economic development of the entire Union, and of sharing in all of its prosperity. In the most immediate sense, the problems of the great population of the West and South are your problems too. Their welfare and prosperity are your welfare and prosperity. The sale of New England's shoes depends in part on the price of Kansas' wheat and Georgia's cotton. Prosperity for the California fruit grower depends in part on the prosperity of the New England textile mill. New England savings have prospered in developing Western mines and railroads and stockyards and farms. I have thought much of this interdependence as I have traveled through the great Western country. And I am confident that level-headed New England knows how true that is, knows it in spite of a cantankerous minority that in every difficult time has found spokesmen to try to persuade New England that its interest is not the interest of the rest of the Union. They tell New England today as they have told it before that it has been ruined by Government policies designed to benefit only the rest of the Union. We all know that New England has had its troubles. We all know that New England is coming out of its troubles. If you need figures to prove that, here they are for the State of Massachusetts: Payrolls for the first half of 1936 are up 32 percent over the first half of 1933. Retail sales are up 20 percent. Farm income, excluding benefit payments, is up 37 1/2 percent. Building construction in sixty-two Massachusetts cities is up 100 percent. Does that look to you like the end of private enterprise? For many years under Republican Administrations, New England was handicapped. What were the causes? Every realistic business man of New England knows. First: That New England had established standards of wages and of living which put some of its industries at a competitive disadvantage with sections of the country which had not reached those standards. Second: That those lower standards were exploited by an absentee landlordism which exported from New England too much of its capital-capital that was used elsewhere to compete with industries at home. Third: Concentrated wealth and economic power gobbled up or wiped out or moved away hundreds of small independent New England businesses-the kinds of businesses with which at one time New England had conquered the markets of the world. What did Republican leadership do to meet those difficulties? A high protective tariff alone could not help New England meet the unfair competition from domestic competitors on the one hand, and the unfair competition of monopoly on the other. To make matters worse, that tariff shut off the foreign commerce on which the sea coast population and industrial population of New England had lived. The full fruit of these Republican policies of twelve years is found in the record of what happened to New England's industries under those policies. New England was engulfed by the depression five years before the rest of the country. That is New England's debt to the Republican leadership of the boom era. What has this Administration done? We have raised wages and living standards in other sections of the country. They are being brought up toward the standards of New England. That kind of unfair competition is being destroyed. Most of us are in favor of that. We have begun the first real offensive in our history against that concentrated wealth and monopolistic power which almost destroyed the small businesses and diversified industries of New England. Most of us are in favor of that. By reciprocal trade agreements, we have begun to reopen foreign markets for New England products and New England shipping and trade. Most of us are in favor of that. We have increased the purchasing power of New England's customers out on the farms and in the cities of the Nation. And most of us are in favor of that. New England has traditionally been a land of moderate-sized independent business, a land of economic democracy. Its farseeing statesmen have always understood that democracy was impossible under the relentless pressure of concentration and monopoly wielded by the new power of high finance. The New England Puritan spirit of simplicity, the New England passion for democracy, the New England genius for democratic statescraft, are the very sources of that program of this Administration which set itself to end such concentration of wealth and economic power. Daniel Webster spoke for all that was wisest in New England when he said at Plymouth Rock: The freest Government, if it could exist, would not be long acceptable, if the tendency of the laws were to create a rapid accumulation of property in few hands, and to render the great mass of the population dependent and penniless. Universal suffrage could not long exist in a community where there was great inequality of property. What have we done in our fight against monopolies? We have taxed the intercorporate dividends of holding companies. We have graduated taxes on corporations according to income, just as taxes on individuals were graduated long ago. We have made it harder for big corporations to retain the huge undistributed profits with which they gobble up small business. We have raised the surtaxes on big incomes and the estate taxes on big fortunes. We have regulated the financial markets through which mergers and consolidations and monopolies are created with other people's money. Way back in 1776 John Adams wrote to his friend Patrick Henry: The decree is gone forth, and it cannot be recalled, that a more equal liberty than has prevailed in other parts of the earth, must be established in America. The exuberance of pride which has produced an insolent domination in a few, a very few, opulent monopolizing families, will be brought down nearer to the confines of reason and moderation, than they have been used to. I am glad to travel in the company of John Adams and Daniel Webster. Boston and Massachusetts and New England have not lost the spirit that has made the Nation great.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbostonmass", "title": "Address at Boston, Mass.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-boston-mass", "publication_date": "21-10-1936", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

{"id": 1083, "text": "Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I talked about the idea of opportunity for all. Opportunity is the idea at the heart of this country: that no matter who you are or how you started out, with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead. I am even more passionate about it today. Because while our economy has been growing for 4 years and those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead, and that is been true since long before the recession hit. We have got to reverse those trends. We have got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. And the opportunity agenda I laid out last week will help us do that. It is an agenda with four parts. Number one, more new jobs. Number two, training folks with the skills to fill those jobs. Number three, guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. And number four, making sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that is there when you need it. I want to work with Congress on this agenda wherever I can. But in this year of action, whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, I will. I have got a pen, and I have got a phone: a pen to take executive action and a phone to rally citizens and business leaders who are eager to create new jobs and new opportunities. And we have already begun. In Wisconsin, I ordered an across-the-board reform of our training programs to train folks with the skills employers need and then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. In Pittsburgh, I directed the Treasury to create MyRA, a new way for working Americans even if you are not wealthy to start your own retirement savings. In Maryland, I rallied the leaders of some of America's biggest tech companies to help us make sure all our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology to help them learn the skills they need for the new economy. And at the White House, I brought together business leaders who have committed to helping more unemployed Americans find work, no matter how long they have been looking. And I directed the Federal Government to make hiring decisions the same way: based on whether applicants can do the job, not when they last had a job. So when you hear me talking about using my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class Americans and those working to get into the middle class, that is what I mean. And I am going to keep asking students and parents and business leaders to help, because there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, ready to move this country forward, and determined to restore the founding vision of opportunity for all. That is what I am all about. Thanks, have a great weekend. And to our Olympians in Sochi, go Team U.S.A.!", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsweeklyaddress308", "title": "The President's Weekly Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-weekly-address-308", "publication_date": "08-02-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 690, "text": "Thank you all very much. Thanks for your warm welcome. My fellow club members thank you all for-- I appreciate you all coming out to greet my friend and a friend of America, the President of Poland, a fine leader and a fine gentleman. I want to thank Stan and Sylvia. I want to thank all the folks who put on the dinner or-we call it dinner in Texas-lunch here in Michigan. And I want to thank my fellow Americans for coming out to say hello. We had a wonderful dinner last night in Washington. We all wore our black ties. I rented mine right around the corner. But it was a wonderful occasion. And as much as I loved it last night, I was really looking forward to coming with the President here to Michigan, because there is a lot of great-there is a lot of great Americans who happen to be from Polish descent living here, and I thought it was a perfect place for him to come. I want to thank Cardinal Maida for coming. He was-he came to dinner last night with us, and he jumped on Air Force One. We found plenty of room for him. But he is such a-such a dignified human being, and I am proud to call him friend. And thank you for your leadership, sir. I want to thank the Englers, our friends the Englers, the great Governor and the first lady of the State of Michigan. They have been our friends for a long time. I know the Lieutenant Governor is here. I appreciate you being here, Dick. Thank you for coming, Dick Posthumus. Candice Miller, the secretary of state, I appreciate you being here. We have got our Ambassador from Poland with us, Christopher Hill. He is doing a fine job. Chris, thank you for being here. We have got a great delegation from the Polish Government with us, scattered throughout, I guess. Mr. Minister, thank you for coming. I appreciate you all being here. I want to just tell you right quickly that America has got a strong, strong friend in Poland. The Polish Government and the Polish people are-they understand what we went through. They understand- they have had a history of people wanting to take away their freedoms too. See, we share that common bond. And they also understand that we owe it to our children and we owe it to future generations beyond our children to hold people to account, to hold the killers to account, to bring the killers to justice in order to defend our freedoms. And that is what we are going to do. Some predicted that the farther we got away from September the 11th, the more the American people would grow weary or kind of forget what happened. And Mr. President, you need to know that is not the case-that is not the case. Anybody attacks us and attacks our freedom, we do not forget that. And therefore, Mr. President, you are a guest in a country that is united and strong and resolved, resolved to keep our coalition together and resolved to defend our freedom, no matter what the cost. And Poland understands that, and for that we are grateful. And so it is been our privilege the last 2 days to welcome the First Lady and the President, President Kwasniewski, here to the United States of America. It is been a great trip, and it is a chance for us to- chance for me to introduce him to you, my fellow Americans. Mr. President, you are among some of the finest we have in our country, the good Polish Americans of the State of Michigan.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksluncheonwithpolishamericanleaderstroymichigan", "title": "Remarks at a Luncheon With Polish American Leaders in Troy, Michigan", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-luncheon-with-polish-american-leaders-troy-michigan", "publication_date": "18-07-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 1069, "text": "Thank you, Josh Smith, and all of you. Thank you very much, Josh, and thank all of you. My heavens, 27 different States, I am told, represented here by all of you. Josh, I cannot begin to thank you, not only for your friendship and loyal support but your service to the Government, to the people, I would put it that way, and also for your outstanding commitment to small business and your own accomplishments in that field. I also want to acknowledge Josh's wife, Jackie Jones-Smith, who is the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission; my old friend Milton Bins here, chairman of the Council of 100. Kay James from the Office of National Drug Control Policy gave up an awful lot to move over there to fight this drug scourge, and I am very proud of her. Reverend Thad Garrett, we all know Thad. He ought to be praying more and talking less out there on the campaign -- -- I need that, I will tell you. But somebody once gave me a little rug, and it said, What would we do without friends? I am grateful that Thad and so many others out here are true and loyal friends. When the going is tough, they are hanging in there. I want to salute Fred Brown, the chairman of the National Council of Black Republicans. I was very grateful to Reverend Larry Haygood for that invocation, for his leadership in education, for his commitment and faith. Thank you, sir, for coming and for doing that. Of course, I cannot say too much about Lou Sullivan. I love it when we talk about genuine health care reform for this country. He summarized it in his remarks there, giving me the credit. But he is out there on the cutting edge. When a paper like the New York Times, which has not been overly friendly to me this year -- -- points out that we have got a sound, or the best of the health care reform programs out there, why, I am very grateful to Lou. He is tireless in taking the message across the country, and he is leading this, the largest Government bureau, with such distinction and honor. I tell you, we are lucky to have him in the Government. Ginger is not clapping too hard. Maybe she wants him back; I do not know. But nevertheless. May I salute Gary Franks, distinguished Member of Congress. I do not see him, but I know he is here. Where is Gary? Well, he is not here. All right, he is late. He is to be here; Andy Ireland, a Member of the United States Congress, with us here today, too. I want to single out a warrior. Some of you know her just by seeing her on television. Some of you know her for seeing her at my side as I climb on the helicopter or Air Force One or go to take on some political debate. And I am talking about Marlin's able deputy, Judy Smith, who is standing right over here. Judy, I do not want this to come out wrong, but you talk about tough women. I mean, she is strong, and in a wonderful way. She takes it and can dish it out just as well. It is tough out there in that press arena. But boy, she is doing a superb job for me and I think for the country because she gets out our position on fundamental issues that are important to the Nation. Let me just talk for a few minutes. I am off to Wisconsin in a few minutes and then to New Jersey. So I want to just talk a little bit about the concerns that we share about the future of this great country, about the choice that we have in shaping that future. I will spare you a stemwinding political oration, but I will just point out that we have got a great task before us, and the differences are clear. With the end of the cold war that Reverend Haygood very generously referred to, now we have got to turn our attention to winning the new global economic competition. The other side is telling us everything that is wrong about the economy, and I will accept my share of the blame. But we are caught up in something worldwide. And any fair-minded observer knows that it is not just the United States that is had difficult economic times. It is England. It is France. It is Canada. It is Germany now. A lot of countries in this, and we have the strongest economy of all of them. It is my objective to make it even stronger. I call that winning the peace, for only then will we keep the promise of opportunity that is the birthright of every American. I am proud of the fact that our kids go to bed at night without that same fear of nuclear weapons that their predecessors had. This is, I think, a significant accomplishment, and I salute everyone in our administration that worked to help end that nuclear nightmare. But now we have got to do the same thing, apply that same leadership, and lift this country up. You know, the Governor, Governor Clinton, and I offer very different choices. They are really based on very different philosophies, different experience. He is spent most of his life in government. He believes that government, kind of a Washington elite, should take the lead in shaping the economy. He uses the word investing : investing your money, that is taxpayers' money, more wisely than you can as entrepreneurs and individuals. Well, that is not the way I see it at all. Like so many of you, I have spent exactly 50 percent of my adult life in business and 50 percent in government. Not with the sparkling success that some in this room have had as business people, but nevertheless, I understand it. I built a business from the ground up. I met a payroll, created jobs, and worked for a living. I happen to think that that is a good qualification for being ENTITY of the United States, because I believe it is a prospering small business or large business environment that is going to do more to help people. Put it this way, a job in the private sector is going to do more to help people than Government programs can. I learned in that private sector what many of you not only have learned but have mastered: what makes an economy grow. It is not central planning, quote, investing, unquote, the taxpayers' money. It is not the people who take your taxes and spend them. It is you who make the economy grow, ordinary men and women with the extraordinary dreams who have the grit to make those dreams real. And I am very grateful to what Josh does in taking this message of small business out around this country. That understanding is really at the heart of what Larry Haygood again referred to as the Agenda for American Renewal. I talk about the global economy and then what we are going to do now to be the lead. We are the only remaining military superpower. We have the strongest economy; I want to help make it stronger. I want to see us become an export superpower as well. To do this, we have got to unleash the energy, the brainpower of our workers and our entrepreneurs, and again, particularly in small business because this is the area that employs the most and takes the risks and creates the new opportunities. I want to encourage investment so that wages rise and those unemployment lines shrink. That is why I am helping small business in particular and, hopefully, all business in general. We unveiled a good small business program the other day down in North Carolina. I will just touch on a couple of points: Reducing the corporate tax rate for small business 15 percent to 10 percent; increasing the amount of equipment that small business can expense, and thus that would create more jobs and new opportunities; simplifying the tax filing. Most small-business people know that the onerous reporting for tax purposes takes too many work hours, too many people hours, and we are trying to change that. Then, of course, I still feel that to stimulate risk-taking, the reduction in the capital gains is very, very important, bringing people into the enterprise zones in the minority areas; a reduction in capital gains, a break on that will help attract jobs to the areas that need it the very most. So to the business people here, we are trying to streamline so you will not have to be second-guessed back here in Washington by some bureaucratic establishment. And that is why we have put an end to the Federal regulations that turn redtape into pink slips. We just put out a moratorium on them. We are going to go forward with safety and health; obviously we have to do that. But we have got a moratorium, a blanket on new regulations, recognizing that there is too much control and regulation on the back of the small entrepreneur and the small-business person. We really do want to do what Lou was talking about, and that is to make health insurance available to everyone. We want to make health care more accessible and more affordable for everyone. That is why we are all -- have our shoulders to the wheel, fighting for health care reform without burdening small businesses with expensive new mandates and more payroll taxes. Our program is good. It keeps the quality of American health care where it belongs, number one in the entire world, and still says to those who cannot get insurance, we are going to make it available to you through pooling, and also we are going to reduce the costs. We are doing something about these crazy malpractice suits and also doing something about lifting the regulatory burden and streamlining the operating processes of our health care system. So we have got a good program there, and I hope that it'll get the kind of support in the very next Congress that we need to have it enacted into law. I want to reward the risktakers who bring capital and jobs to our inner cities; I touched on that. But it is very interesting to me that when we went to Los Angeles in the wake of the South Central problems, all the civic leaders there were saying we must have enterprise zones. It is an idea whose time has come. We ought to try it at the Federal level. So we are fighting hard to bring the enterprise zones into reality. On issue after issue, you see the very sharp differences between my opponent and me, because he really does want a Government. He is already proposed more taxes, more spending, more regulations. He is already proposed programs that would result in the latter, in the last item, and tax plans and spending plans that would tax at the outset $150 billion more in taxes and $220 billion more in spending. It is going to kill off a lot of small business. So we want to free up, instead, the genius of American enterprise and initiative. This is going to be one of the clearest distinctions as people begin to really make up their minds on this election. Let me be clear: I am not anti-Government. Government must never shirk its responsibilities. The fine men and women honored here today who I have been proud to have at my side for the past 3 years are a testament to the good work that Government can do. We believe it is Government's role to create opportunity, though, and not stifle it, and to clear the path for individual accomplishment, not to block it; to facilitate, not to dictate. Together, we believe that there is no room in our country, and I want to repeat this here, for discrimination of any kind whatsoever. As long as I am ENTITY, I am going to do absolutely everything I can in my power to drive bigotry and anti-Semitism and racism from our great land. You know, I hope you know that I have strong feelings about this. Lou and Josh and I were talking. I am not sure the American people know how strongly I feel about this. That is one of the reasons I hope we get these debates on. We have proposed four debates with the Governor. Let him step up now and debate. We have accepted his formula for two of them, and so, we will have an opportunity there without any filters, without any Monday morning quarterbacks telling you what you thought you heard, to take the case directly to the American people. I have tried in my public life -- like supporting fair housing when I was a Member of Congress from Texas and fighting for I think decent civil rights legislation, whether it is the ADA bill or an antidiscriminatory civil rights bill. I think we got, and others here have mentioned this very generously, an excellent record of appointing officials on the content of their character and their competence to positions of high authority in the Government. I am proud of what both Josh and Lou talked about, to have appointed a higher percentage of blacks and women in the history of the Presidency to important positions. Some are here with us today: Gwen King at the Social Security Commission, who is now going on to new pursuits. I mentioned Kay James, who served with such distinction in several capacities. Some are nonpolitical. I think it is a wonderful thing that Colin Powell is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I do not know anything about his politics, and I could not care less. I know something about his character, though. I know something about his ability, though. I know something of how it is when he is making tough, tough decisions regarding the life of somebody else's son and daughter, and that is all I need to know in selecting the best Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Connie Newman, we all know her, how she served with great distinction in this administration; and a most beloved figure, Joyce Berry. I mentioned Lou, of course. I mentioned Josh for the Commission. But we have got others, Carla Hills, Antonia Novello, Lynn Martin, Bernadine Healy, all women in high-level positions. I am proud of Wayne Budd over at Justice. You talk abut a tough assignment, there is a decent man and a man of honor, fulfilling an extraordinarily tough assignment over at the Department of Justice. My old friend Art Fletcher is head of the Commission. Let me tell you something: I am not going to let the political diatribes going on out there and attacks coming out of some radical groups diminish the pride I take in having appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. So let others try to smear a decent man. I am standing with him. He is going to be a great Justice. You watch. You just wait. He is just beginning. He is going to be outstanding. So we are here to salute all of you -- I came over to do that -- and to thank you, those in Government, for serving and serving with integrity. I will tell you something: Our administration has been a clean administration. You look back over your shoulders. We have not had scandals because we have honorable men and women who sacrifice to serve their country. I am proud of each and every one of you. And in terms of those others who are out in the private sector employing people, creating opportunity, living the American dream, I salute you as well. We want to facilitate what you are doing, not get Government in the way and make it tougher. So this is the message we will be taking to the American people, and I believe we are going to get this job done. It has not been a very pleasant political year for Barbara Bush and me; I will have to confess that. Indeed, I have been around the political track for a long time, and I have never seen quite the anger and the ugliness in the political process, the willingness to twist and distort and make things ugly. But it is worth it; you know it. It is worth it because we have accomplished a lot for this country. We have accomplished a lot on the world scene as well. Now I want to finish the job, finish the job by bringing opportunity and hope to all Americans, and I am very grateful to each and every one of you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalsalutethepresidentandhisblackappointees", "title": "Remarks at the National Salute to the President and His Black Appointees", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-salute-the-president-and-his-black-appointees", "publication_date": "30-09-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 697, "text": "I do not know about you, but all morning I have been sitting in there watching the sky. I heard early predictions of rain; we will have to get this over with. But I thank you all very much, and it is always a pleasure to welcome the business men and women of America to the White House. I am delighted to take part in celebrating World Trade Week, which reaffirms the importance to our well-being of trade and recognizes the need for increased export efforts. America's future growth and prosperity depend on how well we develop and compete in foreign markets. One in eight manufacturing jobs is related to exports, and 25 percent of our farmers' cash receipts come from exports. In fact, exports account for 25 percent of the total value of all goods produced in this country. Exports mean jobs for our people, profits for our businesses, and growth for our economy. And that is why it is going to be a pleasure to present the well-deserved E and E Star Awards for excellence in exporting. But let me begin by pointing out the backdrop for export opportunities in the economic climate here at home. I know you are all familiar with the dramatic turnaround that has been accomplished. We are in the midst of a wonderful economic expansion, and I believe we have a lot to be proud of. Our growth is helping to pull the rest of the free world out of recession, and this will increase demand for American exports. But occasionally the interests of diplomacy and the interests of American industry seem to conflict. Well, our administration sees it as our job to reconcile the two and make it easier for American business to open up new markets on a fair footing. And we are working hard in that direction. In 1982 we passed the Export Trading Company Act aimed at opening foreign trade opportunities for medium- and small-sized companies. The bill removed impediments to trade, permitting companies to sell American products overseas more efficiently and more effectively. We are also implementing an international investment policy to reduce the number of government measures that distort or impede the flow of international investment. Our trade missions have been to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, seeking to develop new export opportunities. Now, these are just several of the efforts. We are going to do everything we can to get government out of the way to make sure that you have the opportunity to compete effectively in world markets. And there is something else. Last November 1 visited Japan and Korea. And last month it was China. And next week it is Europe and the London Economic Summit. I am beginning to feel a little like an export product myself. But one of the key purposes of these trips is to see that all the export trading doors are opened as wide as possible. As I told a number of export trade industry representatives last month in Tacoma, when I go abroad I go as something of a salesman and do everything I can to promote U.S.. exports except, possibly, wear a Buy American bumper sticker on my bag. We are committed to keeping markets open to free trade. We oppose protectionism because, like so many other forms of government intervention, it does not work. Protectionism brings higher prices, it provokes retaliation, and it insulates inefficiencies in production. And we will continue to oppose it. Government can set the framework for expanded trade, but it cannot make trade flourish. That is up to you, the private sector, to make that happen. And that is why it is my privilege to present the E and E Star Awards. Our award winners are making it happen in a fiercely competitive environment. And you have good reason to be proud, and we are proud of you. And so now, for the awards, I shall turn this back to Secretary Brown. Well, thank you all again for being here. And congratulations to all of you, gentlemen. Thank you very much. And now, I will go back to work.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthepresentationceremonyforthepresidentseandestarawards0", "title": "Remarks at the Presentation Ceremony for the President's E and E Star Awards", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-presentation-ceremony-for-the-presidents-e-and-e-star-awards-0", "publication_date": "23-05-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 866, "text": "President Kimball, President Romney, President Tanner, members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, distinguished representatives of the governments at all levels, ladies and gentlemen. This is absolutely beautiful. And I am very honored, Mr. President, that you would present this to me. I am also honored to be here with you in this beautiful place. I came a little earlier than the audience may have known, and I was pleased to watch the absolutely delightful and memorable television spots that remind all of us who are members of families what our duties are, to hear the Primary Children's Chorus singing I Am a Child of God, to hear the Lamanite Generation, Native Americans, singing Go, My Son, and then, of course, to come in and meet the Osmond family, which is a very famous and admirable group in our Nation. It is a pleasure for me to receive this award, representing a typical American family, and I want to thank you for it. As a matter of fact, I had my typical American family this past weekend at Camp David, 30 of the members of my family. I finally escaped yesterday. After 2 or 3 intense days of negotiation, I think we reached a framework for peace among ourselves. It was nice to keep my family out of the news for a few days. It was one of the most delightful experiences in many years for me. We have a large family, a close family, an exciting family, and one which has given one another great help and support and encouragement in times of difficulty or excitement or joy or achievement or sorrow. There is nothing that gives me more pleasure, even as President of the United States, than to have Amy come to me in the evening, when I am tired and concerned and worried, and put her arms around my neck and give me a kiss. She was born, my first daughter, after Rosalynn and I had been married 21 years. And she now is proud to call herself a double-digit preteenager. She is a great young lady and the joy of our lives. And I was able to have with me in the last few days my two grandsons. And we are expecting, I hope, a new granddaughter in just a few days from now. When I was invited to come here for this special observance of the family-what it means under the guidance of Jesus Christ and the great Nation of the United States of America, supported and strengthened by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, publicized and promoted by this special week I wondered what I wanted to say to you. I thought about the early Mormons coming across this country, singing a famous hymn, I think, that originated in England, Come, Come Ye Saints. I thought about the times of trial in our country, a time when strength was demanded of all of us, a time when we sometimes feel alone. Only a deep faith could let the words of that song, All Is Well, ring out. In times when you and your forefathers were persecuted, driven one from another, crossed this land looking for freedom, a chance to worship in your own way, when perhaps you knew that you were about to die, when drought and thirst afflicted you and still the song rang out All Is Well. This is indeed a demonstration of an act of faith and a reaffirmation of hope. I come here as President of a great country. And in that same act of faith and in affirmation of hope, I tell you that our Nation can say all is well. And even the American family can be characterized by the same phrase, all is well. Because as was your early church in the minds and hearts of your own forefathers, so is our Nation and the family so precious, so dear, so innately good and right and decent and strong, that challenges to us, to our Nation, to the American family can successfully be withstood. I grew up in an isolated place, 3 miles west of Plains, Georgia, on a farm, where a family was indeed a self-contained community, where every member of the family felt wanted and loved and secure. When I was sad or hurt, my mother was there, my father was there. We worked together. Some plowed a mule; some carried and dropped a seed or fertilizer; some hoed out weeds; some carried water to the field for the others to drink; some took care of the hogs or the cows or the chickens; some kept the home secure. But in every instance each knew that the other one was contributing, and the children understood the function of the parents, and the parents understood and loved the children. There was easy communication among us. And in our relatively primitive, isolated state of living, we were bound together by love. My first church was my family. I first heard the Bible read in my family. I first heard prayer in my family. I learned about God within the family. My first school was my family. My first government was my family. There, in an embryonic stage of growth, I began to perceive the world around me. And when I had questions, they were answered. When I had doubts, they were resolved. When I had needs, they were met. My family was strong. And there was very little need for services to be derived from government for us. And since I have served in the State legislature and as Governor of a State and now as President, and participated in international affairs, I have learned more and more that the stronger a family is, the stronger families are, the less role there is to be played by government. Our government spends a great deal of its time and effort, a great deal of your money repairing damages caused by weak or broken families. We have signs of deteriorating family structures in our country that cause us great concern. And there is not any inherent reason for it. I agree with a rabbi named Heschel, who said, I have never understood how a father can take care of 12 children, and 12 children cannot take care of 1 father. But when families fail, governments must act. And sometimes they act in error. When massive programs are put together through government, the individuality of human beings is sometimes forgotten and the sensitivity is lost. Our welfare programs, for instance, in some of their aspects, are antifamily. They function only when a father has actually left a home. And sometimes fathers leave homes temporarily, through subterfuge, sometimes permanently, just so a child can be fed. In our modern, mobile, permissive society, the basic moral strengths that bind families together are sometimes weakened or broken entirely. For every two marriages that took place in the United States last year, there was one divorce. For people born in the early years of this century and later married, only 1 out of 10 marriages resulted in divorce. For Americans born since World War II who married, one out of three marriages results in divorce. Children are troubled. Teenage suicide has doubled in the last 10 years, and now the second most prevalent cause of death among male teenagers is suicide. Births out of wedlock are increasing rapidly. I could go on and on. But these brutal and disturbing statistics are caused by a lack of strength among family members. Lily Tomlin says as a joke, We are all in this alone. And sometimes we feel that in a fast-moving, modern, technological society that we are alone, not as it was in former generations because of separation of distance because now we can be alone in a crowded apartment building, because our next-door neighbors remain strangers. A family is a mutual improvement society. All of us have weaknesses, faults, fears, yearnings, hopes, dreams, ideals that we cannot realize alone, and the support and the concern and the understanding and the care and, sometimes, the criticism and punishment in a constructive way help to repair our weaknesses. I do not know of any man who is more deeply indebted to one's family than am I. I have had great political ambitions. I have traveled widely. And my family has always gone a second mile in giving me their love and their actual support. Never once have I asked my mother, my brother, my sisters, my children, my wife to give me their help or their confidence when they said, Your ambitions are too great. I have got my own life to live. I'd rather not give you my help. Your great church epitomizes to me what a family ought to be a church that believes, through moral imperative, in strong families, in individualism, the right to be different, but the opportunity and even duty to grow as a human being, to prepare oneself for greater service. The relief society organized by your church has brought blessings to tens of thousands of people, not in a highly publicized way, but in a quiet and effective way. And when your forebears first reached this valley, in less than 3 years there was a new college. At that time there was a common belief in our Nation that women could not stand the rigors of college life, but you knew different. And now this State has the highest educational level of any State in the Nation. The State constitution recognized in 1896 that women and men should have the same civil, political, religious rights and privileges. And we are trying now to spread that same commitment throughout our entire Nation. The recognition of what a human being is, what a human being can be, is important. But a commitment of one person to another to realize that great potential is an element sometimes missing in our modern society. Many people these days feel alone. There is a Yiddish proverb, a religious proverb, that says, God gave burdens, also shoulders. A simple proverb it does not say God gave us burdens, but he gave us shoulders strong enough to bear them, it just says, God gave burdens, also shoulders. We not only have our own shoulders to carry burdens, but we have others to help, not just to carry burdens but, sometimes, shoulders to cry on. Those shoulders let us bear the burdens of life. And with each generation comes a tremendous challenge, difficulties, and most of those challenges and difficulties are derived from mandatory change. We tend to think the changes that take place in our own life are the greatest that have ever afflicted any generation, but this is not true. Our early forebears in this Nation offered their lives, all their belongings, even their family security, to achieve freedom, liberty. Later, our Nation was torn by a War Between the States. Pioneers moved West. The changes that took place in individual lives then were much greater than those that take place today. But we learned in a time of change, no matter which generation it is, that there are some things which do not change. Those things can be described as the elements of a good family truth, unselfishness, idealism, commitment, courage, understanding, morality, security, love. As a father, I understand those things. As a husband, I understand those things. As President, I understand the same things. There are legitimate roles for a government to perform: to assure that our Nation lives in peace; to assure that our people have an opportunity for employment, for jobs, to use what talent God might have given them in a sustained and productive way; to eliminate the threats to society, to the family drugs, crime; to initiate preventive health care; to provide for better education, transportation, security; to cut down on some of the afflictions, such as unwanted pregnancies that lead to abortions, things that deeply religious people and others deplore; to raise the ideals of individuals; and to sustain the ideals and morals of a nation itself. I know how much less difficult my own duties would be as President if your mammoth crusade for stable and strong families should be successful. That is why I feel a close kinship with you and a partnership with you in achieving this noble purpose. Each person's sphere of influence need not be great. A father, a mother, a child can change the course of human history, can change the character of a community, a State, or even a nation. If we cling to those things, that should never change. God gave us burdens, also shoulders, so that we, working together under religious teachings that we study from different perspectives, in a nation committed to individualism and freedom and high purpose, might be successful and that you and I together might enjoy stronger families and a greater and stronger nation.

{"id": 570, "text": "It is manifestly my duty to bring to your attention the industrial situation which confronts the country. The situation growing out of the prevailing railway and coal-mining strikes is so serious, so menacing to the nation's welfare, that I should be remiss if I failed frankly to lay the matter before you and at the same time acquaint you and the whole people with such efforts as the executive branch of the Government has made by the voluntary exercise of its good offices to effect a settlement. The suspension of the coal industry dates back to last April 1, when the working agreement between mine operators and the United Mine Workers came to an end. Anticipating that expiration of contract, which was negotiated with the Government's sanction in 1920, the present administration sought, as early as last October, conferences between the operators and miners in order to facilitate either a new or extended agreement in order to avoid any suspension of production when April 1 arrived. At that time the mine workers declined to confer, though the operators were agreeable, the mine workers excusing their declination on the ground that the union officials could have no authority to negotiate until after their annual convention. A short time prior to the expiration of the working agreement the mine workers invited a conference with the operators in the central competitive field, covering the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and in spite of the union declination of the Government's informal suggestion for the conference, five months before, the Government, informally but sincerely, commended the conference, but it was declined by certain groups of operators, and the coal-mining controversy ended in the strike of April 1. It was instantly made nation-wide, so far as the organized mine workers could control, and included many districts in the bituminous field where there was neither grievance nor dispute, and effected a complete tie-up of the production in the anthracite field. It is to be noted that when the suspension began large stocks of coal were on hand, mined at wages higher than those paid during the war, there was only the buying impelled by necessity, and there was a belief that coal must yield to the postwar readjustment. When the stocks on hand began to reach such diminution as to menace industry and hinder transportation, approximately June 1, overtures were initiated by the Government in the hope of expediting settlement. None of these availed. Individual and district tenders of settlement on the part of operators-in some instances appeals for settlement-were wholly unavailing. The dominant groups among the operators were insistent on having district agreements; the dominant mine workers were demanding a nation-wide settlement. The Government being without authority to enforce a strike settlement in the coal industry, could only volunteer its good offices in finding a way of adjustment. Accordingly, a conference of the coal operators' associations and the general and district officials of the United Mine Workers was called, to meet in Washington on July 1. The designation of representation was left to the officials of the various organizations, and there was nation-wide representation, except from the nonunion fields of the country. Before the joint meeting I expressed the deep concern of the country and invited them to meet at a conference table and end the disputes between them. The conference did not develop even a hope. The operators were asking for their district or territorial conferences; the workers demanded national settlement on old bases. Appraising correctly the hopelessness of the situation, I again invited both operators and workers to meet with me, and tendered a means of settlement so justly inspired that it was difficult to see how anyone believing in industrial peace and justice to all concerned could decline it. In substance, it called on the operators to open their mines, on the mine workers to resume work at the same pay and under the same working conditions as prevailed at the time the strike began. In turn, the Government was to create at once a coal commission, or two of them, if preferred by all parties to the dispute, so that one could deal with the bituminous situation, the other with the problems in the anthracite field. Among the commissioners were to be representatives of the operators, representatives of the mine workers, and outstanding, disinterested, and able representatives of the American public. The commission was to be instructed to direct its first inquiry to the rate of wage to be paid for the period ending next April 1, and then to enter upon a fact-finding inquiry into every phase of the industry, and point the way to avoid future suspensions in production. The disputants all indorsed the suggestion of a fact-finding commission. The anthracite operators promptly accepted the entire proposal. The mine workers refused to resume work under the arbitration plan. The majority of the bituminous operators filed an acceptance, but a considerable minority declined the proposal. Under these circumstances, having no authority to demand compliance, the Government had no other course than to invite a resumption of production under the rights of all parties to the controversy, with assurance of Government protection of each and every one in his lawful pursuits. This fact was communicated to the governors of all coal-producing states, and with two exceptions assurances of maintained law and order were promptly given. In some instances concrete proof of effective readiness to protect all men, strikers and nonstriking workmen alike, was promptly given. But little or no new production followed. The simple but significant truth was revealed that, except for such coal as comes from the districts worked by nonorganized miners, the country is at the mercy of the United Mine Workers. Governors in various states reported that their operators and miners had no dispute and were eager to resume production. District leaders informed me that their workmen were anxious to return to their jobs but that they were not permitted to do so. Hundreds of wives of workmen have addressed the White House, beseeching a settlement, alleging that they know no grievance, and there is an unending story of appeals for relief where necessity or suffering were impelling, where a mere expression of need ought to find ready compliance. At every stage, the Government has been a just neutral regarding wage scales and working contracts. There are fundamental evils in our present system of producing and distribution which make the wage problem difficult. In the bituminous coal fields are vastly more miners than are requisite to the country's needs, and there are 200,000 more mine workers than are needed to produce in continuous employment the country's normal requirements. By continuous employment I mean approximately 280 working-days in the year. In many instances last year men were employed less than 150 days, in some cases much fewer than that. In the overmanned sections men divide the working time, and high wages are necessary to meet the cost of the barest living. Interrupted transportation, sorely broken employment, the failure to develop storage against enlarged demands and inadequate carrying-all these present problems bear on righteous wage adjustment and demand constructive solution. Because of these things, because of the impressions of many cases of unjustifiable profits in the industry, and because public interest demands investigation, and demands the finding of facts be given to the public, I am asking at your hands the authority to create a commission to make a searching investigation into the whole coal industry, with provision for its lawful activities and the bestowal of authority to reveal every phase of coal production, sale, and distribution. I am speaking now on behalf of mine workers, mine operators, and the American public. It will bring protection to all and point the way to continuity of production and the better economic functioning of the industry in the future. The necessity for such a searching national investigation with constructive recommendation is imperative. At the moment the coal skies are clearing, but unless we find a cure for the economic ills which affect the industry and therein find a basis for righteous relationship, we shall be faced with a like menacing situation on next April 1 on the expiration of the wage contracts which are now being made. The need for such investigation and independent consideration is revealed by both operators and mine workers in the provision in the Cleveland agreement so recently made. The Government will gladly cooperate with the industry in this program so far as it is the public interest so to do, but I have an unalterable conviction that no lasting satisfaction or worth-while results will ensue unless we may have a Government commission, independent of the industry, clothed with authority by the Congress to search deeply, so that it may advise as to fair wages and as to conditions of labor and recommend the enactment of laws to protect the public in the future. The almost total exhaustion of stocks of coal, the crippled condition of the railways, the distressed situation that has arisen and might grow worse in our great cities due to the shortage of anthracite, the suffering which might arise in the Northwest through failure to meet the winter needs by lake transportation, all these added to the possibility of outrageous price demands, in spite of the most zealous voluntary efforts of the Government to restrain them, make it necessary to ask you to consider at once some form of temporary control of distribution and prices. The administration earnestly has sought to restrain profiteering and to secure the rightful distribution of such coal as has been available in this emergency. There were no legal powers for price control. There has been cordial cooperation in many fields, a fine revelation of business conscience stronger than the temptation to profit by a people's misfortune. There have been instances of flat refusal. I rejoice to make grateful acknowledgment to those who preferred to contribute to national welfare rather than profit by a nation's distress. If it may have your approval, I recommend immediate provision for a temporary national coal agency, with needed capital, to purchase, sell, and distribute coal which is carried in interstate shipment. I do not mean that all interstate coal shall be handled by such a federal organization; perhaps none will be necessary; but it will restore its capital to the Public Treasury and will be the instrumentality of guarding the public interest where private conscience is insensible to a public need. This proposal does not relate to any possible employment in intrastate shipments. Price restraint and equitable distribution in intrastate shipments is a responsibility of the state's own government. In such voluntary activities as have been carried on thus far the federal Government has endeavored to reestablish the authority and responsibility in the states which was undermined in the necessary centralization of authority during the World War. The public menace in the coal situation was made more acute and more serious at the beginning of July by the strike of the Federated Shop Crafts in the railroad service-a strike against a wage decision made by the Railroad Labor Board, directly affecting approximately 400,000 men. The justice of the decision is not for discussion here. The decision has been lost sight of in subsequent developments. In any event, it was always possible to appeal for rehearing and the submission of new evidence, and it is always a safe assumption that a Government agency of adjustment deciding unjustly will be quick to make right any wrong. The Railroad Labor Board was created by Congress for the express purpose of hearing and deciding disputes between the carriers and their employees, so that no controversy need lead to an interruption in interstate transportation. It was inevitable that many wage disputes should arise. Wages had, mounted upward, necessarily and justly, during the war upheaval, likewise the cost of transportation, so that the higher wages might be paid. It was inevitable that some readjustments should follow. Naturally these readjustments were resisted. The administrative Government neither advocated nor opposed. It only held that the Labor Board was the lawful agency of the Government to hear and decide disputes, and its authority must be sustained, as the law contemplates. This must be so, whether the carriers or the employees ignore its decisions. Unhappily a number of decisions of this board had been ignored by the carriers. In only one instance, however, had a decision, challenged by a carrier, been brought to the attention of the Department of Justice, and this decision was promptly carried to the courts and has recently been sustained in the federal Court of Appeals. The public or the Executive had no knowledge of the ignored decisions in other cases, because they did not hinder transportation. When these failures of many of the carriers to abide by decisions of the board were brought to my attention, I could more fairly appraise the feelings of the strikers, though they had a remedy without seeking to paralyze interstate commerce. The law creating the Railroad Labor Board is inadequate. Contrary to popular impression, it has little or no power to enforce its decisions. It can impose no penalties on either party disregarding its decisions. It cannot halt a strike, and manifestly Congress deliberately omitted the enactment of compulsory arbitration. The decisions of the board must be made enforceable and effective against carriers and employees alike. But the law is new, and no perfection of it by Congress at this moment could be helpful in the present threatened paralysis of transportation. Happily it is always lawful and ofttimes possible to settle disputes outside of court, so, in a desire to serve public welfare, I ventured upon an attempt at mediation. Those who had preceded me in attempted settlements had made some progress. I submitted to the officials of the striking employees and the chairman of the Association of Railway Executives, in writing, on the same day, a tentative proposal for settlement. Knowing that some of the carriers had offended by ignoring the decisions of the board, and the employees had struck when they had a remedy without the strike, I felt it was best to start all over again, resume work, all to agree to abide faithfully by the board's decisions, make it a real tribunal of peace in transportation, and everybody serve the public. The barrier to be surmounted was the question of seniority. By the workmen these rights are held to be sacred, and unsurrendered by a strike. By the carriers the preservation of seniority is the weapon of discipline on the one hand and the reward of faithful employees on the other. It has been an almost invariable rule that when strikes have been lost seniority and its advantages have been surrendered; when strikes have been settled seniority has been restored. In the tentative proposal which I sponsored it was provided that everybody should go to work, with seniority rights unimpaired, that there should be no discrimination by either workmen or carriers against workmen who did or did not strike. I realized that the proposal must carry a disappointment to employees who had inherited promotion by staying loyally on the job, and to such new men as had sought jobs looking to permanent employment, but I wanted the fresh start and maintained transportation service, and I appraised the disappointment of the few to be less important than the impending misfortune to the nation. It was not what I would ask ordinarily to be considered or conceded, but at that moment of deep anxiety, with the coal shortage gravely menacing, I was thinking of the pressing demands of the welfare of the whole people. I believed the sacrifice brought to the men involved could be amply compensated for by the carriers in practical ways. I believed that the matter of transcendent importance was the acceptance of the proposal to respect the Labor Board's decisions on the questions which formed the issue at the time of the strike. The public compensation would be complete in guarding by law against recurrence. The proposal was rejected by the carriers. Though the rejection did not end all negotiation, it left the Government only, one course- to call the striking workmen to return to work, to call the carriers to assign them to work, and leave the dispute about seniority to the Labor Board for decision. When negotiation or mediation fails, this is the course contemplated by the law and the Government can have no chart for its course except the law. To this call a majority of the carriers responded favorably, proposing to reemploy all strikers except those guilty of violence against workmen or property, to restore the striking workmen to their old positions where vacant, or to like positions where vacancies are filled; questions of seniority which can not be settled between the employer and employees to go to the Labor Board for decision. The minority of the carriers proposed to assign jobs to workmen on strike only where the positions were vacant. Neither proposal has been accepted. Thus the narrative brings us to the present moment, but it has not included the developments which have heightened the Government's concern. Sympathetic strikes have developed here and there, seriously impairing interstate commerce. Deserted transcontinental trains in the desert regions of the Southwest have revealed the cruelty and contempt for law on the part of some railway employees, who have con-spired to paralyze transportation, and lawlessness and violence in a hundred places have revealed the failure of the striking unions to hold their forces to law observance. Men who refused to strike and who have braved insult and assault and risked their lives to serve the public need have been cruelly attacked and wounded or killed. Men seeking work and guards attempting to protect lives and property, even officers of the federal Government, have been assaulted, humiliated, and hindered in their duties. Strikers have armed themselves and gathered in mobs about railroad shops to offer armed violence to any man attempting to go to work. There is a state of lawlessness shocking to every conception of American law and order and violating the cherished guaranties of American freedom. At no time has the federal Government been unready or unwilling to give its support to maintain law and order and restrain violence, but in no case has state authority confessed its inability to cope with the situation and asked for federal assistance. Under these conditions of hindrance and intimidation there has been such a lack of care of motive power that the deterioration of locomotives and the noncompliance with the safety requirements of the law are threatening the breakdown of transportation. This very serious menace is magnified by the millions of losses to fruit growers and other producers of perishable foodstuffs, and comparable losses to farmers who depend on transportation to market their grains at harvest time. Even worse, it is hindering the transport of available coal when industry is on the verge of paralysis because of coal shortage, and life and health are menaced by coal famine in the great centers of population. Surely the threatening conditions must impress the Congress and the country that no body of men, whether limited in numbers and responsible for railway management or powerful in numbers and the necessary forces in railroad operation, shall be permitted to choose a course which so imperils public welfare. Neither organizations of employers nor workingmen's unions may escape responsibility. When related to a public service the mere fact of organization magnifies that responsibility and public interest transcends that of either grouped capital or organized labor. Another development is so significant that the hardships of the moment may well be endured to rivet popular attention to necessary settlement. It is fundamental to all freedom that all men have unquestioned rights to lawful pursuits, to work and to live and choose their own lawful ways to happiness. In these strikes these rights have been denied by assault and violence, by armed lawlessness. In many communities the municipal authorities have winked at these violations, until liberty is a mockery and the law a matter of community contempt. It is fair to say that the great mass of organized workmen do not approve, but they seem helpless to hinder. These conditions can not remain in free America. If free men can not toil according to their own lawful choosing, all our constitutional guaranties born of democracy are surrendered to mobocracy and the freedom of a hundred millions is surrendered to the small minority which would have no law. It is not my thought to ask Congress to deal with these fundamental problems at this time. No hasty action would contribute to the solution of the present critical situation. There is existing law by which to settle the prevailing disputes. There are statutes forbidding conspiracy to hinder interstate commerce. There are laws to assure the highest possible safety in railway service. It is my purpose to invoke these laws, civil and criminal, against all offenders alike. The legal safeguarding against like menaces in the future must be worked out when no passion sways, when no prejudice influences, when the whole problem may be appraised, and the public welfare may be asserted against any and every interest which assumes authority beyond that of the Government itself. One specific thing I must ask at your hands at the earliest possible moment. There is pending a bill to provide for the better protection of aliens and for the enforcement of their treaty rights. It is a measure, in short, to create a jurisdiction for the federal courts through which the national Government will have appropriate power to protect aliens in the rights secured to them under treaties and to deal with crimes which affect our foreign relations. The matter has been before Congress on many previous occasions. President Tyler, in his first annual message, advised Congress that inasmuch as the Government is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth, it ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other. President Harrison asked for the same bestowal of jurisdiction, having encountered deep embarrassment which grew out of the lynching of eleven aliens in New Orleans in 1891. President McKinley, dealing with a like problem in 1899, asked the conferring upon federal courts jurisdiction in that class of international cases where the ultimate responsibility of the federal Government may be involved. President Roosevelt uttered a like request to Congress in 1906, and President Taft pointed out the defect in the present federal jurisdiction when he made his inaugural address in 1909. He declared that it puts our Government in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagement to protect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform these engagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in states or cities not within our control. If we would promise, we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise. We can not permit the possible failure of justice, due to local prejudice in any state or municipal government, to expose us to the risk of war which might be avoided if federal jurisdiction were asserted by suitable legislation by Congress. My renewal of this oft-made recommendation is impelled by a pitiable sense of federal impotence to deal with the shocking crime at Herrin, Illinois, which so recently shamed and horrified the country. In that butchery of human beings, wrought in madness, it is alleged that two aliens were murdered. This act adds to the outraged sense of American justice the humiliation which lies in the federal Government's confessed lack of authority to punish that unutterable crime. Had it happened in any other land than our own, and the wrath of righteous justice were not effectively expressed, we should have pitied the civilization that would tolerate and sorrow for the Government unwilling or unable to mete out just punishment. I have felt the deep current of popular resentment that the federal Government has not sought to efface this blot from our national shield, that the federal Government has been tolerant of the mockery of local inquiry and the failure of justice in Illinois. It is the regrettable truth that the federal Government can not act under the law. But the bestowal of the jurisdiction necessary to enable federal courts to act appropriately will open the way to punish barbarity and butchery at Herrin or elsewhere, no matter in whose name or for what purpose the insufferable outrage is committed. It is deplorable that there are or can be American communities where even there are citizens, not to speak of public officials, who believe mob warfare is admissible to cure any situation. It is terrorizing to know that such madness may be directed against men merely for choosing to accept lawful employment. I wish the federal Government to be able to put an end to such crimes against civilization and punish those who sanction them. In the weeks of patient conference and attempts at settlement I have come to appraise another element in the engrossing industrial dispute of which it is only fair to take cognizance. It is in some degree responsible for the strikes and has hindered attempts at adjustments. I refer to the warfare on the unions of labor. The Government has no sympathy or approval for this element of discord in the ranks of industry. Any legislation in the future must be as free from this element of trouble making as it is from labor extremists who strive for class domination. We recognize these organizations in the law, and we must accredit them with incalculable contribution to labor's uplift. It is of public interest to preserve them and profit by the good that is in them, but we must check the abuses and the excesses which conflict with public interest, precisely as we have been progressively legislating to prevent capitalistic, corporate, or managerial domination which is contrary to public welfare. We also recognize the right of employers and employees alike within the law, to establish their methods of conducting business, to choose their employment and to determine their relations with each other. We must reassert the doctrine that in this republic the first obligation and the first allegiance of every citizen, high or low, is to his Government, and to hold that Government to be the just and unchallenged sponsor for public welfare, and the liberty, security, and rights of all its citizens. No matter what clouds may gather, no matter what storms may ensue, no matter what hardships may attend or what sacrifice may be necessary, government by law must and will be sustained. Wherefore I am resolved to use all the power of the Government to maintain transportation, and sustain the right of men to work.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

{"id": 920, "text": "Thank you very much, Mr. Woolsey. Tony Lake and I are glad to be here and always seemed to me I ought to visit the CIA on a snowy day. Thank you for that warm welcome. I wanted to come here today for two reasons, first, to meet you and to thank you, those of you who work for the Central Intelligence Agency who devote your lives and your skills to the service of our country. The second thing I wanted to do is to commemorate those who have given their lives in the service of the country through the Central Intelligence Agency. Intelligence is a unique mission. Nobody knows that better than those of us who have the honor to serve in the Oval Office. When President Truman autographed the photo of himself that hangs in this building, he wrote, To the CIA, a necessity to ENTITY of the United States from one who knows. Every morning ENTITY begins the day asking, What happened overnight? What do we know? How do we know it? Like my predecessors, I have to look to the intelligence community for the answers to those questions. I look to you to warn me and, through me, our Nation of the threats, to spotlight the important trends in the world, to describe dynamics that could affect our interests around the world. Those activities are particularly important now. The end of the cold war increases our security in many ways. You helped to win that cold war, and it is fitting that a piece of the Berlin Wall stands here on these grounds. But even now, this new world remains dangerous and, in many ways, more complex and more difficult to fathom. We need to understand more than we do about the challenges of ethnic conflict, militant nationalism, terrorism, and the proliferation of all kinds of weapons. Accurate, reliable intelligence is the key to understanding each of these challenges. And without it, it is difficult to make good decisions in a crisis or in the long-term. I know that working in the intelligence community places special demands on each and every one of you. It means you cannot talk freely about much of your work with your family and your friends. For some, it means spending a lot of time far away from home. For others, it is meant serving in situations of significant personal danger. While much of your work is sensitive and cannot be discussed publicly, I know what you do. I value it, and I respect you for doing it. And I wanted to come here to say thank you. The 56 stars carved into the wall here in this lobby remind each who passes by this place of the ultimate risks of intelligence work. Each star memorializes a vibrant life given in the service of our Nation. Each star reminds us of freedom's high price and how the high share some must bear that all the rest of us must respect. My heart goes out to the families and to the friends of each of those whose sacrifices are represented here. Two of the stars added just this year commemorate two devoted agency professionals who were slain last January entering this compound, Dr. Lansing Bennett and Frank Darling. All of us were shocked and saddened when they were killed and others were seriously injured. The First Lady represented me here at the memorial service, but I want to say again personally how much I admire the service that they gave, the sorrow and anger we all felt and continue to feel about this outrageous act. The CIA was established over 45 years ago to help confront the challenges to democracy. These stars remind us that the battle lines of freedom need not be thousands of miles away, but can be right here in the midst of our communities with our families and friends. Jim Woolsey and I know that all of you here today are called to a very special kind of public service. I celebrate your commitment. I appreciate your contributions. As ENTITY, I will do my best to learn from you, to help you to do your work, and to stand by you. And on behalf of the American people, let me say again, I thank you.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkscentralintelligenceagencyemployeeslangleyvirginia0", "title": "Remarks to Central Intelligence Agency Employees in Langley, Virginia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-central-intelligence-agency-employees-langley-virginia-0", "publication_date": "04-01-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 860, "text": "Thank you, everybody. Please, you are making me blush. I love you back! To Joe Solmonese, who is doing an outstanding job on behalf of HRC; to my great friend and supporter Terry Bean, cofounder of HRC; Representative Patrick Kennedy; David Huebner, the Ambassador-designee to New Zealand and Samoa; John Berry, our Director of OPM, who is doing a great job; Nancy Sutley, chairman of Council on Environmental Quality; Fred Hochberg, chairman of Export-Import Bank; and my dear friend Tipper Gore, who is in the house. Thank you so much, all of you. It is a privilege to be here tonight to open for Lady Gaga I have made it. I want to thank the Human Rights Campaign for inviting me to speak and for the work you do every day in pursuit of equality on behalf of the millions of people in this country who work hard in their jobs and care deeply about their families and who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. For nearly 30 years, you have advocated on behalf of those without a voice. That is not easy. For despite the real gains that we have made, there is still laws to change, and there is still hearts to open. There are still fellow citizens, perhaps neighbors, even loved ones, good and decent people, who hold fast to outworn arguments and old attitudes, who fail to see your families like their families, who would deny you the rights most Americans take for granted. And that is painful, and it is heartbreaking. And yet you continue, leading by the force of the arguments you make and by the power of the example that you set in your own lives as parents and friends, as PTA members and church members, as advocates and leaders in your communities. And you are making a difference. That is the story of the movement for fairness and equality and not just for those who are gay, but for all those in our history who've been denied the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, for all who've been told that the full blessings and opportunities of this country were closed to them. It is the story of progress sought by those with little influence or power, by men and women who brought about change through quiet, personal acts of compassion and defiance wherever and whenever they could. It is the story of the Stonewall protests, when a group of citizens with a few options when a group of citizens with few options and fewer supporters stood up against discrimination and helped to inspire a movement. It is the story of an epidemic that decimated a community and the gay men and women who came to support one another and save one another, who continue to fight this scourge, who have demonstrated before the world that different kinds of families can show the same compassion in a time of need. And it is the story of the Human Rights Campaign and the fights you have fought for nearly 30 years, helping to elect candidates who share your values, standing against those who would enshrine discrimination into our Constitution, advocating on behalf of those living with HIV/AIDS, and fighting for progress in our Capital and across America. This story, this fight, continues now, and I am here with a simple message: I am here with you in that fight. For even as we face extraordinary challenges as a nation, we cannot and we will not put aside issues of basic equality. I greatly appreciate the support I have received from many in this room. I also appreciate that many of you do not believe progress has come fast enough. I want to be honest about that, because it is important to be honest among friends. Now, I have said this before, I will repeat it again: It is not for me to tell you to be patient, any more than it was for others to counsel patience to African Americans petitioning for equal rights half a century ago. But I will say this: We have made progress, and we will make more. And I think it is important to remember that there is not a single issue that my administration deals with on a daily basis that does not touch on the lives of the LGBT community. We all have a stake in reviving this economy. We all have a stake in putting people back to work. We all have a stake in improving our schools and achieving quality, affordable health care. We all have a stake in meeting the difficult challenges we face in Iraq and Afghanistan. For while some may wish to define you solely by your sexual orientation or gender identity alone, you know and I know that none of us wants to be defined by just one part of what makes us whole. You are also parents worried about your children's futures. You are spouses who fear that you or the person you love will lose a job. You are workers worried about the rising cost of health insurance. You are soldiers, you are neighbors, you are friends. And most importantly, you are Americans who care deeply about this country and its future. So I know you want me working on jobs and the economy and all the other issues that we are dealing with. But my commitment to you is unwavering, even as we wrestle with these enormous problems. And while progress may be taking longer than you'd like as a result of all that we face, and that is the truth, do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach. My expectation is that when you look back on these years, you will see a time in which we put a stop to discrimination against gays and lesbians, whether in the office or on the battlefield. You will see a time in which we as a nation finally recognize relationships between two men or two women as just as real and admirable as relationships between a man and a woman. You will see a nation that is valuing and cherishing these families, as we build a more perfect union, a union in which gay Americans are an important part. I am committed to these goals, and my administration will continue fighting to achieve them. And there is no more poignant or painful reminder of how important it is that we do so than the loss experienced by Dennis and Judy Shepard, whose son Matthew was stolen in a terrible act of violence 11 years ago. In May, I met with Judy who is here tonight with her husband I met her in the Oval Office, and I promised her that we were going to pass an inclusive hate crimes bill, a bill named for her son. This struggle has been long. Time and again we faced opposition. Time and again, the measure was defeated or delayed. But the Shepards never gave up. They turned tragedy into an unshakeable commitment. Countless activists and organizers never gave up. You held vigils; you spoke out, year after year, Congress after Congress. The House passed the bill again this week. And I can announce that after more than a decade, this bill is set to pass, and I will sign it into law. It is a testament to the decade-long struggle of Judy and Dennis, who tonight will receive a tribute named for somebody who inspired so many of us named for Senator Ted Kennedy, who fought tirelessly for this legislation. And it is a testament to the Human Rights Campaign and those who organized and advocated. And it is a testament to Matthew and to others who've been the victims of attacks not just meant to break bones, but to break spirits; not meant just to inflict harm, but to instill fear. Together, we will have moved closer to that day when no one has to be afraid to be gay in America, when no one has to fear walking down the street holding the hand of the person they love. But we know there is far more work to do. We are pushing hard to pass an inclusive employee nondiscrimination bill. For the first time ever, an administration official testified in Congress in favor of this law. Nobody in America should be fired because they are gay, despite doing a great job and meeting their responsibilities. It is not fair, it is not right, we are going to put a stop to it. And it is for this reason that if any of my nominees are attacked, not for what they believe, but for who they are, I will not waver in my support, because I will not waver in my commitment to ending discrimination in all its forms. We are reinvigorating our response to HIV/AIDS here at home and around the world. We are working closely with the Congress to renew the Ryan White Program, and I look forward to signing it into law in the very near future. We are rescinding the discriminatory ban on entry to the United States based on HIV status. The regulatory process to enact this important change is already underway. And we also know that HIV/AIDS continues to be a public health threat in many communities, including right here in the District of Columbia. Jeffrey Crowley, the Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, recently held a forum in Washington, DC, and is holding forums across the country to seek input as we craft a national strategy to address this crisis. We are moving ahead on do not ask, do not tell. We should not be punishing patriotic Americans who have stepped forward to serve this country. We should be celebrating their willingness to show such courage and selflessness on behalf of their fellow citizens, especially when we are fighting two wars. We cannot afford to cut from our ranks people with the critical skills we need to fight any more than we can afford, for our military's integrity, to force those willing to do so into careers encumbered and compromised by having to live a lie. So I am working with the Pentagon, its leadership, and the Members of the House and Senate on ending this policy. Legislation has been introduced in the House to make this happen. I will end do not ask, do not tell. That is my commitment to you. It is no secret that issues of great concern to gays and lesbians are ones that raise a great deal of emotion in this country. And it is no secret that progress has been incredibly difficult. We can see that with the time and dedication it took to pass hate crimes legislation. But these issues also go to the heart of who we are as a people. Are we a nation that can transcend old attitudes and worn divides? Can we embrace our differences and look to the hopes and dreams that we share? Will we uphold the ideals on which this Nation was founded, that all of us are equal, that all of us deserve the same opportunity to live our lives freely and pursue our chance at happiness? I believe we can; I believe we will. And that is why that is why I support ensuring that committed gay couples have the same rights and responsibilities afforded to any married couple in this country. I believe strongly in stopping laws designed to take rights away and passing laws that extend equal rights to gay couples. I have required all agencies in the Federal Government to extend as many Federal benefits as possible to LGBT families as the current law allows. And I have called on Congress to repeal the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and to pass the Domestic Partners Benefits and Obligations Act. And we must all stand together against divisive and deceptive efforts to feed people's lingering fears for political and ideological gain. For the struggle waged by the Human Rights Campaign is about more than any policy we can enshrine into law. It is about our capacity to love and commit to one another. It is about whether or not we value as a society that love and commitment. It is about our common humanity and our willingness to walk in someone else's shoes, to imagine losing a job not because of your performance at work but because of your relationship at home, to imagine worrying about a spouse in the hospital with the added fear that you will have to produce a legal document just to comfort the person you love, to imagine the pain of losing a partner of decades and then discovering that the law treats you like a stranger. If we are honest with ourselves we will admit that there are too many who do not yet know in their lives or feel in their hearts the urgency of this struggle. That is why I continue to speak about the importance of equality for LGBT families, and not just in front of gay audiences. That is why Michelle and I have invited LGBT families to the White House to participate in events like the Easter Egg Roll, because we want to send a message. And that is why it is so important that you continue to speak out, that you continue to set an example, that you continue to pressure leaders, including me, and to make the case all across America. So tonight I am hopeful because of the activism I see in this room, because of the compassion I have seen all across America, and because of the progress we have made throughout our history, including the history of the movement for LGBT equality. Soon after the protests at Stonewall 40 years ago, the phone rang in the home of a soft-spoken elementary school teacher named Jeanne Manford. It was one in the morning, and it was the police. Now, her son Morty had been at the Stonewall the night of the raids. Ever since, he had felt within him a new sense of purpose. So, when the officer told Jeanne that her son had been arrested, which was happening often to gay protesters, she was not entirely caught off guard. And then the officer added one more thing: And you know, he is homosexual. Well, that police officer sure was surprised when Jeanne responded: Yes, I know. Why are you bothering him? And not long after, Jeanne would be marching side by side with her son through the streets of New York. She carried a sign that stated her support. People cheered. Young men and women ran up to her, kissed her, and asked her to talk to their parents. And this gave Jeanne and Morty an idea. And so, after that march on the anniversary of the Stonewall protests, amidst the violence and the vitriol of a difficult time for our Nation, Jeanne and her husband Jules, two parents who loved their son deeply, formed a group to support other parents and, in turn, to support their children, as well. At the first meeting Jeanne held in 1973, about 20 people showed up. But slowly, interest grew. Morty's life tragically was cut short by AIDS, but the cause endured. Today, the organization they founded for parents, families, and friends of lesbians and gays has more than 200,000 members and supporters. It is made a difference for countless families across America. And Jeanne would later say, I considered myself such a traditional person. I did not even cross the street against the light. But I was not going to let anybody walk over Morty. That is the story of America: of ordinary citizens organizing, agitating, and advocating for change; of hope stronger than hate; of love more powerful than any insult or injury; of Americans fighting to build for themselves and their families a nation in which no one is a second-class citizen, in which no one is denied their basic rights, in which all of us are free to live and love as we see fit. And tonight, somewhere in America, a young person, let us say a young man, will struggle to fall to sleep, wrestling alone with a secret he is held as long as he can remember. Soon, perhaps, he will decide it is time to let that secret out. What happens next depends on him, his family, as well as his friends and his teachers and his community. But it also depends on us, on the kind of society we engender, the kind of future we build. I believe the future is bright for that young person. For while there will be setbacks and bumps along the road, the truth is that our common ideals are a force far stronger than any division that some might sow. These ideals, when voiced by generations of citizens, are what made it possible for me to stand here today. These ideals are what made it possible for the people in this room to live freely and openly, when for most of history that would have been inconceivable. That is the promise of America, HRC. That is the promise we are called to fulfill. Day by day, law by law, changing mind by mind, that is the promise we are fulfilling. Thank you for the work you are doing. God bless you. God bless America.

If she were running for office, she'd get a lot of votes just on being brief, I think. And I thank her for what she said. I am glad to be here with your Governor, Roy Romer, General Ashy, and others. Earlier this month I want to say something serious, if I might, for a moment our Nation lost six patriotic reservists of the 302d Airlift Wing based here at Peterson. Today, I, as their President, just want to remember them with my respects, my gratitude, my thanks. And I'd like to ask if we could all just have a brief moment of silence in their memory, please. Thank you very much. Like the Rockies, the men and women here of Peterson stand tall and strong and proud. You are always ready. You are the sentinels of our air sovereignty. You are the home base for our Space Command and for NORAD. You are our eyes in space. I did a couple of interviews yesterday with some Colorado newspapers, and one of them asked me if we still needed eyes in space since the cold war was over. And I said, the last time I checked we had more stuff up in space every day; I thought we needed more eyes, not fewer. I thank you for what you are doing. You have made America safer. You have made the world safer. And as we face the new challenges of the 21st century, you know as well as I do that the American military will continue to play a vital role, not only in the defense of our freedom and our security but also in advancing the cause of democracy and freedom throughout the world. We have seen painfully in the United States in the last several months, first at the World Trade Center and then at the awful incident at Oklahoma City, that our security can be threatened in a global economy with open borders and lots of personal freedom here at home as well as beyond our borders. We had those two terrorist incidents: One of them occurred from people I believe were deeply disturbed and way off track within our country; another occurred because this is a free country and people can come and go here, and people who bore us ill will and wanted to destroy a symbol of American democracy came into this country and set that bomb at the World Trade Center. I am also happy to tell you that other sentinels of freedom working to thwart terrorism stopped two terrible incidents that were planned, one to blow up another bomb in New York and another that was designed to take some aircraft out of the air, flying out of the West Coast going over the Pacific. But we now know that the security threats we will face in the future, rooted in terrorism and organized crime and drug trafficking, are closely tied to things the military has had to work on for years, trying to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stand up to rogue states, and protect our security interests around the world. We are going to have to fight on all these fronts, and you are going to have to continue to be the best trained, best equipped, best motivated, most flexible military in the world for us to succeed. I am committed to making sure that you always are that and to doing whatever we have to do to improve the quality of life and the conditions of living, so that the best people in America want to be in the military and want to stay in the military. Since I have been President, I have twice had to go back to Congress to ask for large appropriations totaling over $35 billion to help to maintain our training, our readiness, and our quality of life. And this year I asked the Congress for a supplemental appropriation to cover contingencies in the Defense Department so we could fund a pay increase at the maximum legal level allowable and continue to make improvements in readiness and the quality of life. We are going to continue to do that. If you are committed to serving America, the people who make the decisions about investments in your future should be committed to making sure that you can serve and succeed, that you can have good families and a good life in the United States military. And we are very grateful to you for that. Let me say, what I most wanted to do was to have a chance to say thank you personally and to go down the row and shake hands with the children. And while I am very good at stopping the rain, I am not good at keeping it away forever. So I am going to terminate my remarks with a heartfelt thank-you to all of you for your service to the United States. God bless you all, and thank you. Thank you very much.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitypetersonairforcebasecoloradosprings", "title": "William J.

{"id": 865, "text": "It is indeed a signal honor to welcome to this Capital and to this house Their Majesties the King and Queen of Denmark. It is a country with which we are bound by ties of common ideals and principles, and ties of blood. Many of their people have come to this country and indeed, in their country, they celebrate one of our holidays. It has a long and interesting history. And of course, standing as it does as a buttress between the Baltic and the North Seas, it is not strange that they have had a long maritime history. But in these later days it is one of the key countries in the NATO alliance. It is a forward country. Geographically it looks across a very narrow gap to the threatening dictatorship that creates so much tension and indeed so much ill will in this world. So we are proud to call them friend and ally. We need them. We hope that they feel, on their part, a sense of partnership and need for us. I am sure they do. It is a romantic country. Many of you no doubt visited the Castle of Hamlet, and for my part at least, I was astonished to find out that Hamlet never lived in Denmark. It is a country of people calm and serene; they seem never to be startled, never to be hysterical. One great man said of his people: they were always hysterical in victory and panicky in defeat. I think the people of Denmark would be the last people that you could say that about, if you went there and wanted to make a generalization. In any event, it is a great country a prosperous country and above all, one with us, believing in the dignity of man and ready to put everything on the line; to risk even their existence in the defense of these values that free men feel are above all else in life. So you can realize that it is with a great sense of distinction that I ask you all to rise with me to drink to Their Majesties, the King and Queen of Denmark. The Queen and I are deeply moved by the kind words you have addressed to us and by the hearty welcome which you and Mrs. Eisenhower as well as the inhabitants of this beautiful city of Washington have given us. The kind hospitality with which we have been met by everybody during this first part of our stay in the United States has made a great impression on us and will always be kept in grateful memory by the Queen and myself. We have been looking forward with great expectations to this visit which I am sure will contribute to further strengthening of the ties of friendship which so happily unite our two countries. Twenty-one years have elapsed since in 1939 we had the opportunity of paying our first visit to the United States a tour of which we retain the most happy memories 21 years full of dramatic historic events. A world war with its terror and suffering for millions of people lies between then and now. During the dark years of war our two countries each with the means at her disposal aimed at promoting a common cause. We Danes realize how much we owe to the United States, to the courage and sacrifice of the American people, to the indomitable leadership of outstanding individuals as your memorable predecessors and you yourself, Mr. President, and to the dedicated efforts of the United States to achieve a peace based .on freedom and justice for all nations. I wish to take this opportunity to express on behalf of all my countrymen our gratitude towards the United States for their share in the liberation of our country. When peace had been achieved, we were faced with a series of new problems. As a result of the war the economy of my country like that of most other European countries had suffered severe setbacks. The rebuilding and expansion of our means of production and our merchant fleet and the revival of our commerce would not have been completed today had not the United States Government carried out their large-scale aid programs. Through this assistance the United States significantly helped the cause of economic integration in Western Europe. Your country thereby made an inestimable contribution to the unity of the states in our region. It is in my view a major interest, not only of Western Europe, but also of its friends in this hemisphere, that the cause of ever closer cooperation between European nations should enjoy the sympathy and active support of the United States of America. At the same time dark and menacing clouds were again gathering on the international horizon and prevented the peoples of the world from enjoying the peace for which they had fought so bitterly. Certainly those clouds still darken the sun, but thanks to inspiration and support from the United States the free nations of the Western World have joined their efforts to avert the threats to their national existence and their free way of life. Our country and yours are united in NATO. During the past 11 years we have had ample proof of the solidarity of the United States with NATO. We have benefited from the magnanimous aid which has enabled Denmark to build up a defense system without endangering the economic and social stability which are also important links in total defense. The contribution of Denmark to the defense of the whole NATO area is, of course, bound to be on a moderate scale. However, we are fully aware that solidarity with our allies is a necessity if the alliance is to fulfill its mission. The establishment of common defense areas in Greenland, upon which Denmark and the United States agreed in 1951, is one of the Danish contributions to that end. During our recent visit to Greenland the Queen and I had the pleasure to visit one of these areas and to inspect the forces stationed there. The high efficiency of these forces gained and deserved our sincere admiration. While both of us see in the alliance which unites us a purely defensive instrument and a successful means to avert the horrors of a new war, we are not closing our eyes to, but indeed seeking, all possible means to diminish the present tension in the world. We are grateful to you, Mr. President, for your untiring, personal efforts in the cause of peace and good will. They are the ultimate proof of the peaceful aims to which the policy of the United States as well as Denmark are dedicated. The close cooperation between our two countries in the United Nations and other international organizations is based on an identity of views with respect to the fundamental elements of life and stamped by mutual respect and sympathy. To this contribute in no slight degree the ties which unite many Americans of Danish origin with the land of their ancestors. for centuries Danes have gone to the United States to work and study. Many of them stayed on and founded their new homes in their country of adoption; we are happy to meet them here as esteemed and mostly prosperous citizens of this great country. New bonds of friendship have been created by the ever increasing numbers of American visitors coming to Denmark and Danes going to the United States. A most useful and ever increasing exchange of scientists, students, teachers, etc., has developed since the war thanks to American generosity and planning. This constitutes an essential factor in the cultural relations between our two countries. Tourist travel also is becoming possible for wider and wider groups of our citizens, thanks to the rising standards of living and the progress in the means of transportation. We Danes have always been proud of our merchant marine. In the field of air transportation we have by pooling our resources with our sister nations, Norway and Sweden significantly assisted in making connections between your country and Scandinavia easier and closer. These personal links across oceans and borders bear evidence of the freedom reigning in our countries. Let us unite in the hope that the torch of freedom which we received from our fathers may also illuminate the path of our descendants for generations to come. I raise my glass in honor of the President of the United States and Mrs. Eisenhower, for the prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandkingfrederikdenmark", "title": "Toasts of the President and King Frederik of Denmark", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-king-frederik-denmark", "publication_date": "11-10-1960", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 564, "text": "Good morning. January is the time of year when many of us make New Year's resolutions and work hard to keep them. Today I want to talk about steps we are taking to keep a resolution of mine: making sure women and men get the health care they need to have strong children and healthy families. First, our administration has worked hard to make sure all women have access to prenatal care. We know when women get medical attention before a baby is born, that child is much more likely to be born healthy. And good health is the most precious gift we can offer a child or a family. Second, we worked with Congress to make sure that every woman covered by Federal Government health insurance has reproductive health care coverage, including prescription contraceptives. That was a significant step for more than a million American women, and it set a standard for insurance coverage around the country. Third, when I took office, we faced an epidemic of teen pregnancy-children having children. Over the last 7 years, we have reached out to community groups, schools, and health professionals working in an amazing network of American citizens from all walks of life. And together, the American people have cut teen pregnancy by 15 percent. Fourth, we have made a broad range of family planning and sex education programs more widely available for all Americans. And by making sure women have family planning choices, we are helping to make abortion more rare. Today I am glad to announce we will be increasing funds for family planning and reproductive health care by $35 million next year. My budget for 2001 will include $274 million in grants for clinics and community-based health services that reach more than 5 million women and families. That money will help make contraceptives available and keep them affordable. It will fund counseling for teenagers and support educational programs that encourage young people to postpone sexual activity. It will help more than 4,600 clinics screen for cancer, AIDS, and other diseases. And it will fund partnerships with community organizations and health care professionals who are reaching out to teenagers and others at risk. These services make a critical difference in people's lives. They help working women who otherwise could not afford medical tests that may save their lives. They help AIDS patients who desperately need counseling and assistance. They provide support and information to young people who may not know the basics of caring for a newborn child. They give women access to the full range of reproductive health care before and during pregnancy. It is in the interest of every American that no one miss out on this kind of care and that no child miss the chance for a healthy start. America has also been a leader in providing health and family planning assistance for women and families in developing countries. We do this because it is right and because it will help build the kind of world we want for our own children. Around the world, 150 million women would like to choose the timing of their pregnancies, but have no access to family planning of any kind. In the developing world, the complications of pregnancy kill more than one woman every single minute, because so many lack the most basic health care. These are personal tragedies, and they have profound consequences for families and communities. Where children are born healthy and mothers and families gain power over their lives, communities are stronger; economic progress is faster; and the future is brighter for everyone. My budget for 2001 will increase funding for international family planning by almost $170 million. I am asking Congress to support these funds, and to provide them without restrictions that hamper the work of family planning organizations and even bar them from discussing or debating reproductive health policies. We all agree that we want to save lives, help women and children stay healthy, and empower families to take responsibility for their own choices. Supporting reproductive health and family planning is one of the very best ways to do that. We know it works. At home and abroad, we do not have a woman's life or a child's healthy start to waste.
