Although CARDINAL NORP students now study in NORP colleges and universities, more NORP must immerse themselves in NORP societies and cultures. As the exchange of free people and ideas flows between our nations and as the cold war ends in victory for our cause, our economic relations have taken center stage.

NORP business does not need a handout and does not want one. Some say that perhaps it is time to help GPE out of a sense of pity or compassion. Let me tell you, we are looking for no such help. What GPE wants from GPE is for GPE to recognize its international economic responsibility for its own sake and for the sake of the global marketplace upon which GPE depends. When we express appreciation to those who seek to open NORP markets, it is not because we need a handout but because we know an open GPE is good for us all. Our companies simply expect the chance to compete fairly in markets around the world. Our Government remains committed to open markets, and we will further reduce our own trade barriers as our friends dismantle their own. Our CARDINAL countries have embarked on a unique experiment in economic independence called the Structural Impediments Initiative. In this effort, each side pinpoints the other's barriers to competitiveness, and each commits to reduce them. We both must reinvigorate this commitment to market access, whether for high quality NORP products or quality NORP services. The beneficiaries will be the workers and consumers on both sides of the Pacific. It means greater openness in many sectors of the NORP economy still biased against outside investment. These practices hurt NORP companies, but they also hurt NORP consumers. NORP want the same things you want, a better quality of life for themselves and their families. NORP never say, Please raise our prices. Every worker is also a consumer, and economic competition brings them great choices and lower prices.

The success of the round depends on bold, farsighted leadership. We must lift our gaze to the glimmering horizon of broader prosperity and not worry over the stones in our immediate path. Yes, all of us have problems with portions of the so-called PERSON draft, but we cannot let the progress it represents slip through our fingers.

We recognize that some of our bilateral trade imbalance stems from causes other than restricted market access. CARDINAL reason for GPE's competitiveness is because GPE has saved and invested at a rate double that of GPE. You have focused on applied research and development and new manufacturing technologies. Your companies have established fine quality control systems. You have developed a highly educated labor force and have taken the long view to develop markets abroad. There is much for us to learn from you. We are taking steps to boost our competitiveness. We can and will increase our rate of savings and investment.

After all, if we can get everybody to take the tests, if they know what they are up against, in the end we will prevent more severe illness, we will reduce cost to the health care system.

Each employee produces QUANTITY of steel per year, including all the executive management. This is the highest productivity per steelworker in the world.

They make steelrod of the highest quality, and PERCENT of it, you might be interested in knowing, is sold at this time to GPE, successfully competing in price CARDINAL the world away with the NORP steelplants that are much closer. The dynamism and competence of our own ORG and its free enterprise system, in my judgment, is equaled by the dynamism and confidence and the competence of the public servants like you, who represent the NORP people in our ORG. I came to the Presidency determined to make my own administration and the Government in general more responsive to the NORP public and at the same time more efficient in the delivery of services to those who look to us for leadership and for service. Since taking office, I have seen repeatedly that the key to the more effective ORG, which we all desire, has been our creation of a more productive, more dynamic, and more cost-conscious ORG workforce.

It was PERSON concept, which the ORG courageously passed for my signature. It was one of the most significant achievements of my own administration. The Civil Service Reform Act gives ORG managers, like many of you, some of the same management incentives that have proved so effectively to make our private economy and its free enterprise system competitive and the pride of the entire world.

With the increase in the prices of the necessaries of life come demands for increase in wages demands which are justified if there be no other means of enabling men to live. Upon the increase of wages there follows close an increase in the price of the products whose producers have been accorded the increase not a proportionate increase, for the manufacturer does not content himself with that but an increase considerably greater that the added wage cost and for which the added wage cost is oftentimes hardly more than an excuse.

As it stands now, it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal, proclamation of peace. But I should judge that it was clearly within the constitutional power of the ORG to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce, and to exclude them from interstate shipment if the requirements of law are not complied with. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented.

It is clearly in the public interest that a penalty should be provided which will be persuasive. To the same end I earnestly recommend, in the second place, that the ORG pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of GPE, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the methods of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went in storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. It would serve as a useful example to the other communities of the country, as well as greatly relieve local distress, if the ORG were to regulate all such matters very fully for GPE, where its legislative authority is without limit. I would also recommend that it be required that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer.

To do so, ORG must be prepared to use force. ORG did use force to curb aggression in GPE, and by so doing has greatly strengthened the cause of peace. I am glad that additional steps are being taken at this session to prepare for quick and effective action in any future case of aggression.  To maintain the peace, ORG must be able to learn the facts about any threat of aggression. Next, it must be able to call quickly upon the member nations to act if the threat becomes serious. Above all, the peace-loving nations must have the military strength available, when called upon, to act decisively to put down aggression. The peace-loving nations are building that strength. However much they may regret the necessity, they will continue to build up their strength until they have created forces strong enough to preserve the peace under ORG. They will do all that is required to provide a defense against aggression. They will do that because, under the conditions which now exist in the world, it is the only way to maintain peace. We intend to build up strength for peace as long as it is necessary. But at the same time, we must continue to strive, through ORG, to achieve international control of atomic energy and the reduction of armaments and armed forces.

Disarmament is the course which GPE would prefer to take. It is the course which most nations would like to adopt. It is the course which ORG from its earliest beginnings has been seeking to follow. For DATE, CARDINAL commissions of ORG have been working on the problem of disarmament. CARDINAL commission has been concerned with the elimination of atomic weapons and the other with the reduction of other types of armaments and of armed forces. Thus far, these commissions have not been successful in obtaining agreement among all the major powers. Nevertheless, DATE of effort have served to bring to the attention of all nations the CARDINAL basic principles upon which any successful plan of disarmament must rest. First, the plan must include all kinds of weapons. The conflict in GPE bears tragic witness to the fact that aggression, whatever the weapons used, brings frightful destruction. Second, the plan must be based on unanimous agreement. A majority of nations is not enough. No plan of disarmament can work unless it includes every nation having substantial armed forces. CARDINAL-sided disarmament is a sure invitation to aggression. Disarmament must be based on safeguards which will insure the compliance of all nations. The safeguards must be adequate to give immediate warning of any threatened violation. It must be rounded upon free and open interchange of information across national borders. The task of working out the successive steps would still be a complex one and would take a long time and much effort. But the fact that this process is so complex and so difficult is no reason for us to give up hope of ultimate success. The will of the world for peace is too strong to allow us to give up in this effort. We cannot permit the history of our times to record that we failed by default. We must explore every avenue which offers any chance of bringing success to the activities of ORG in this vital area. Much valuable work has already been done by the CARDINAL disarmament commissions on the different technical problems confronting them. I believe it would be useful to explore ways in which the work of these commissions could now be more closely brought together. CARDINAL possibility to be considered is whether their work might be revitalized if carried forward in the future through a new and consolidated disarmament commission.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressnewyorkcitybeforetheunitednationsgeneralassembly", "title": "Address in New York City Before the United Nations General Assembly", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-new-york-city-before-the-united-nations-general-assembly", "publication_date": "24-10-1950", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

We pledge that strength to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that the peace-loving members of ORG join us in that pledge. I believe that ORG, strengthened by these pledges, will bring us nearer to the peace we seek. We have learned from hard experience that there is no easy road to peace. We have a solemn obligation to the peoples we represent to continue our combined efforts to achieve the strength that will prevent aggression. At the same time, we have an equally solemn obligation to continue our efforts to find solutions to the major problems and issues that divide the nations. The settlement of these differences would make possible a truly dependable and effective system for the reduction and control of armaments.

It would free the nations to devote more of their energies to wiping out poverty, hunger, and injustice.

In this way, our armaments would be transformed into foods, medicine, tools for use in underdeveloped areas, and into other aids for human advancement. The latest discoveries of science could be made available to men all over the globe.

It is one of the eyes of mankind which never slumbers. Without ceasing, it assembles DATE the events of each part of the world, and transmits them to every other part. The fundamental reason for this lies in the fact that it is felt to be of vital importance to each man, and each community, to know what other men and other communities are doing. The news is printed and read, not for the mere purpose of entertainment, amusement and recreation, but almost entirely for the practical purpose of information, in order that by means of accurate knowledge of what others are doing a course may be laid out of accurate and successful action. Faith in the NORP people means a faith in their ability to form sound judgments, when once the facts have been presented to them clearly and without prejudice. It is this educational work, national in its scope, that ORG performs, and upon its integrity and fairness depends in large measure the course of public opinion in GPE. This work is done without any tinge of personal or political opinion. A very practical need exists, and it is met by a very practical service. It is individual in its nature.

This conception is not exactly at variance with, but certainly supplementary to, the long cherished NORP ideal of the independence of the individual and the independence of the nation. The work of ORG, both necessary and logical, indicates that the true method would appear to lie in recognizing the broad principle of our individual and national dependence, calculating the requirements which flow from that condition, and governing ourselves accordingly. Complete independence means complete coordination and cooperation. From this principle arises the oft-repeated law of service we can help ourselves only as we help others.

It is warranted in considering self to the extent of recognizing that it is justifiable to accumulate and hold the resources which must necessarily be used to serve ourselves, our own household, and our own nation. It recognizes also the necessity of serving others, and when the need arises for meeting a moral requirement, of making individual and national sacrifices sufficient to maintain the cause of righteousness.

Altogether too many of those in a position to do so began to take advantage of the necessities of the situation for their own profit. Finally nearly all of those in responsible positions throughout the entire civilized world had but CARDINAL main object in view, which was the winning of the war. They began to make almost every consideration and motive subsidiary to that great effort. Totally inconceivable amounts of money were raised and expended with a lavishness which DATE would have been believed impossible, and which now seems like some wild nightmare. Notwithstanding the great wave of patriotic fervor which swept over the land; notwithstanding the tremendous sacrifices which the people in every walk of life made, and stood ready to make; almost unconsciously these conditions developed, which I mention not for any purpose now to criticize, where the least scrupulous became the greatest gainers and a considerable part of our population was thrown into a morbid financial state of mind, which even the best intentioned did not wholly escape. The desire for profits and more profits kept on increasing, and the quest for easy money became well-nigh universal.

From all of this sordidness the affairs of government, of course, suffered. In some of it a few public officers were guilty participants. The encouraging thing at present is the evidence of a well-nigh complete return to normal methods of action, and a sane public opinion. The gravity of guilt of this kind is fully realized and publicly reprehended. There is an exceedingly healthy disposition to uproot it altogether, and administer punishment wherever competent evidence of guilt can be produced. That I am doing and propose to continue. Another phase of lingering extravagance, from which the country has not yet fully recovered, is revealed by a consideration of the bills which are pending before the ORG, calling for an expenditure of public money. Exceedingly great efforts have been put forth to reduce the cost of government. CARDINAL of public employees have been released, and every department has been thoroughly deflated and placed under most competent financial supervision. The country as a whole is demanding with great vigor every possible relief from the burden of every unnecessary public expenditure. Yet notwithstanding this, minority groups of one kind or another, and organizations, sometimes almost nation-wide in their ramifications, are making the most determined assaults upon the public treasury. I am advised by the Director of ORG that careful computation discloses that there are bills pending that are seriously pressed for passage, not including the bonus, which would increase the expenditures of ORG for DATE by MONEY. This would mean that outside of ORG, which is practically self-sustaining, the present rate of expenditure would be more than doubled. Each one of these items taken by itself is not large, and its supporters argue that certainly the Government can afford to make this small additional payment.

At present our country does not need a greater outlay of expense, but a greater application of constructive economy. The same state of mind is revealed again in the determined resistance which is made to the adoption of a sound method of taxation. The main argument of the opposition can all be reduced to the supposition that the general public can be relieved of taxation and a greater proportion of taxes laid oil the rich. I shall not examine the soundness of this proposal, the economic injury which it would inflict, or its impossibility as a working principle. I mention it as another example of an attempt to minister to a supposed desire to evade the law of service. It seems as though the public is assumed to desire to have the advantages of a government without paying its part of the cost of maintaining it. Besides being convinced that such a result is utterly impossible of accomplishment, I am even more firmly of the belief that it misrepresents the general attitude of the public mind. Moreover, the success of the Government does riot lie in wringing all the revenue it can from the people, but in making their burden as light and fairly distributed as possible, consistent with the proper maintenance of the necessary public functions. The Government itself, in order to be successful, and all of those connected with it, must put all of their energy upon what they can do for the people, not upon what they can get out of them.

Our policy relative to the debts due to us from NORP countries was well known, and we refused to submit them to these discussions. This never meant that GPE was not willing to lend its assistance to the solution of the NORP problem in any way that did not involve us in their purely political controversies, whenever opportunity presented a plan that promised to be just and effective.

Such improvement can come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere efforts to understand and assist on the part of labor leaders and employers alike. The never-ceasing evolution of human society will doubtless bring forth new problems which will require new adjustments. Our immediate task is to consolidate and maintain the gains achieved. In this situation there is no reason and no occasion for any NORP to allow his fears to be aroused or his energy and enterprise to be paralyzed by doubt or uncertainty. I came to the conclusion that the present-day problem calls for action both by the Government and by the people, that we suffer primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of buying power. It is up to us to create an economic upturn. How and where can and should the Government help to start an upward spiral? I went on to propose CARDINAL groups of measures and I will summarize the recommendations. First, I asked for certain appropriations which are intended to keep the ORG expenditures for work relief and similar purposes during DATE at the same rate of expenditure as at present. That includes additional money for ORG; additional funds for ORG; additional allotments for ORG, and more money for ORG, in order that it can maintain the existing number of camps now in operation.

These CARDINAL steps, taking care of relief needs and adding to bank credits, are in our judgment insufficient by themselves to start the Nation on a sustained upward movement. Therefore, I came to the third kind of Government action which I consider to be vital. You and I cannot afford to equip ourselves with CARDINAL rounds of ammunition where CARDINAL rounds are necessary. If we stop at relief and credit, we may find ourselves without ammunition before the enemy is routed. If we are fully equipped with the third round of ammunition, we stand to win the battle against adversity.

I am thinking of our democracy and of the recent trend in other parts of the world away from the democratic ideal. Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations-not because the people of those nations disliked democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and government weakness through lack of leadership in government. Finally, in desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. We in GPE know that our own democratic institutions can be preserved and made to work. But in order to preserve them we need to act together, to meet the problems of the Nation boldly, and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government is equal to the task of protecting the security of the people. Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our Government to give employment to idle men. The people of GPE are in agreement in defending their liberties at any cost, and the first line of that defense lies in the protection of economic security.

By helping to bring GPE into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful GPE in a stable and peaceful Asia. We will begin to normalize our trade relations with GPE, whose economy is now liberalizing and integrating into the economy of the Asia-Pacific region. Our policy will be to implement the appropriate ORG programs to develop trade with GPE consistent with GPE law.

We have already begun discussing human rights issues with GPE, especially issues regarding religious freedom. Now we can expand and strengthen that dialog. The Secretary of ORG will go to GPE in DATE where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our POW and MIA concerns. I believe normalization and increased contact between NORP and NORP will advance the cause of freedom in GPE, just as it did in Eastern Europe and the former GPE. I strongly believe that engaging the NORP on the broad economic front of economic reform and the broad front of democratic reform will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in GPE.

We are working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking a world free of them. We are working with other nations to confront climate change. We are now a leader and not a follower in that critical mission. We banned torture. We are rebuilding our military. We are reaffirming our alliances. We have begun to leave GPE to its own people, as I committed to doing in the campaign. And we have charted a new way forward in GPE and GPE. We are making progress DATE in taking the fight to ORG and across the globe. And I went to GPE on behalf of the NORP people to begin a new dialogue with the NORP world. We are living up to our obligations as a wealthy nation, helping to promote food security around the world, helping to deal with diseases around the world. We are living up to a moment that demands NORP leadership by standing with the people of GPE as we speak. So in ways large and small, we have begun to deliver on the change that we talked about, the change that you believed in and that you campaigned hard for. We have got a lot more work to do.

And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the NORP Dream, was slipping away. That is the reason I ran for ORG. That is the reason you supported me.

We had a recession, corporate scandals, a stock market correction, a attack on our country. We went to war to defend ourselves; we have had high energy prices; and we had natural disasters. And yet this economy of ours is strong. And I believe the reason why is, is because of the tax cuts we passed in GPE, GPE. We believe that if you have more money in your pocket to save, spend, or invest, the economy grows. And so CARDINAL way to make sure that we are the economic leader in the world is to make sure the tax cuts we passed are permanent. Now, people say, Well, if you make the tax cuts permanent, you cannot balance the budget. I have been there long enough to be able to give you an accurate report. Do not believe it when they say they are going to raise your taxes to balance the budget. They are going to raise your taxes and figure out new ways to spend the money.

See, this is a global economy, whether people like it or not. And the jobs of DATE will be either here in GPE or wherever the workforce is trained to fill those jobs. And therefore, it is important for us to make sure we educate our children early and emphasize math and science so our kids have got the skills necessary to fill those jobs. We changed how we view public education in GPE. We passed the No Child Left Behind Act, see. Are you meeting objectives, for example? If you set a goal, are you meeting those goals? How about every child learning to read at grade level by the third grade? That did not seem like an unrealistic goal to me. As a matter of fact, it was a necessary goal. And then we said to the GPE, you measure. We are going to get you some money, but you measure to show us whether or not we are meeting the goal. And if you are not meeting the goal, figure out why. See, you cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And so the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, we are going to diagnose problems early and solve them, before it is too late. This business about shuffling kids through the school through our schools, based upon age, did not work. And so the No Child Left Behind Act says, we are going to measure early, and we are going to help children who have fallen behind in reading early, and then we are going to extend that to math. See, one of the interesting things is because we measure, we know that we are doing fine in math in the eighth grade. But children get to high school relative to other countries, we are not doing fine in math. And we better do something about it now if we want to be the economic leader of the world.

We want to have CARDINAL adjunct professors in our classrooms in high school and junior sometimes it is not cool to be involved with science and yet it is cool. And we need people who are on the frontlines of science explaining that.

{"id": 6140, "text": "So what I believe the NORP people should understand is that we can put policies in place that encourage economic growth so you have got a better standard of living and, at the same time, become less dependent on energy from overseas and protect the environment. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing we got to do is understand that we have got to change our driving habits over time. You have seen the price of gasoline going up. CARDINAL of the reasons why your price of gasoline is going up is because demand for oil is increasing in places like GPE and GPE, and the supply for oil is not meeting that demand. And the key ingredient for gasoline is crude oil. So when the NORP economy is growing or the NORP economy is growing, and that demand is going up, so is your price at the pump. CARDINAL way to make sure the price at the pump does not go up as global demand increases for hydrocarbons is to figure out how to drive our cars with different kinds of fuels, such as ethanol. CARDINAL of the really interesting developments that is taking place now in GPE is the use of corn-based ethanol pretty cool deal, is not it, for the President to be able to say, you know, we are growing a lot of corn and we are less dependent on foreign sources of oil. It is coming particularly in the Midwest right now, there is a lot of ethanol pumps and plants being developed there to manufacture ethanol from corn. We have got to do more, though, if we are going to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, when it comes to ethanol. And so we are spending a lot of your money to develop technologies that will enable us to be able to manufacture ethanol from wood chips or switchgrass. I said, Well, it is grass that looks like a switch that grows in dry country. In other words, there is all kinds of opportunities to manufacture ethanol, and we are exploring ways to do so. GPE has always been on the leading edge of technology and research and development, and here is an area where we have got to stay on the leading edge of change. Another way to help reduce our use of gasoline is through hybrid vehicles. They are coming; they are coming on the market. As a matter of fact, the energy bill I signed actually will pay you give you a tax credit if you buy a hybrid. We are trying to stimulate demand through the Tax Code.

And ORG is very much involved in this research. We are spending your money, again, on research to help fund breakthroughs for battery technologies that will enable you to drive a plug-in hybrid battery. And, oh, by the way, on ethanol, just one thing I forgot to tell you is that there are CARDINAL flex-fuel vehicles on the road DATE. Flex-fuel means you can either have gasoline or ethanol or a combination of the CARDINAL. You have probably got one and you do not even know it. The technology the barrier to change is not the automobile; it is the ability to make the fuel in quantities economic quantities so we can get them to you at the pump. And same with hybrid batteries; they are coming. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid vehicles with new batteries, they are coming your way. And CARDINAL of the reasons why is because the Government has entered into research partnerships with the private sector to accelerate these technologies, all aimed at making us less dependent on oil. A third way to help this country remain an economic leader when it comes to the cars you drive is hydrogen. We spend MONEY of research to bring hydrogen to the marketplace. CARDINAL fellow reminded me, wisely, it costs it takes quite a bit of power to make hydrogen. An interesting way to make hydrogen on an economic basis would be through nuclear power, see. But we are spending money and time and effort, all aimed at making sure that the automobiles of the future will require less crude oil. And we are close to some significant breakthroughs. It is going to take time to move away from the hydrocarbon economy to the hydrogen economy, and in the meantime, it seems like it makes sense to me to do something about the refinery capacity of GPE. Like, if you are worried about the price of gasoline you do not like it when your price got MONEY and I do not blame you you might want to ask the question, how come the Government is not working hard to expand refinery capacity so that there is more gasoline?

But in the meantime, let us be thoughtful of the consumers here in GPE. We are also going to need a lot of electricity in the future. Electricity demand is projected to increase by PERCENT over DATE. And we better be wise about how we implement a strategy to meet that demand; otherwise, we are not going to be the economic leader; otherwise, our people are not going to be having the good jobs that we want them to have; otherwise, your children and my children, our grandchildren are not going to have the bright, hopeful GPE that we want for them. coal it is PERCENT; nuclear power PERCENT; natural gas PERCENT; and then other renewable sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power.

If we are really interested in diversifying our energy sources and making sure the NORP people have got enough energy to watch this economy grow, we have got to have LNG sites to offload the gas from abroad. And so what we have done is, I signed a new bill, energy bill, that clarifies ORG authority to license new sites, that reduces the bureaucratic obstacles to opening up the terminals and streamlines the development. It is in your interest that we enable liquefied natural gas to come into our country so that we can help take the burden off some of the pricing pressures that we are inevitably going to feel with demand going up and not enough electricity supply.

Finally, I want to talk about nuclear power a subject you all are very familiar with. It is a really important way to meet our goals, which is to have abundant, affordable, clean, and safe sources of energy. In other words, you have nuclear powerplants, you can say, we have got an abundant amount of electricity. And once you get the plant up and running, the operating costs of these plants are significantly lower than other forms of electricity plants, which means the energy is affordable. As I mentioned, nuclear power it is the second leading source of electricity here. We have CARDINAL nuclear powerplants that operate in CARDINAL GPE. Now, we have not built one in a long period of time. People in our country are rightly concerned about greenhouse gases and the environment, and I can understand why; I am too. As a matter of fact, I try to tell people, let us quit the debate about whether greenhouse gases are caused by mankind or by natural causes; let us just focus on technologies that deal with the issue. Nuclear power will help us deal with the issue of greenhouse gases. Without nuclear energy, carbon dioxide emissions would have been PERCENT greater in the electricity industry in DATE. Without nuclear power, we would have had QUANTITY a year of carbon dioxide, and that is nearly equal to the DATE emissions from CARDINAL passenger cars. Nuclear power helps us protect the environment. It is safe because of advances in science and engineering and plant design. It is safe because the workers and managers of our nuclear powerplants are incredibly skilled people who know what they are doing.

GPE I just came from GPE they are going to build some nuclear powerplants. To maintain our economic leadership, we got to do it again. First, in the energy bill I signed in DATE, there are loan guarantees, production tax credits, ORG risk insurance for the builders of new plants.

People do not know this, but you get yourself a design for a nuclear powerplant; you start spending money for plans and engineering plans and everything; you get building; and all of the sudden, somebody can shut you down. And that makes it awfully difficult to take risk, if a lawsuit can cause you to spend enormous sums of money and have no productive use of the money spent. And so we got together with the ORG and said, Well, how what can we do to create incentives to show the industry that we are serious about moving forward? Well, CARDINAL is loan guarantees, and that gives investors confidence that this Government is committed to the construction of nuclear powerplants. Secondly is production tax credits, and those credits will reward investments in the latest advanced nuclear power generation. In other words, there is incentives loan guarantee is an incentive, tax credits are incentives, ORG risk insurance. What the ORG risk insurance says is offered for the first CARDINAL new powerplant nuclear powerplants.

Too many NORP are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we have got to take those steps DATE. To improve health care in GPE, we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It is a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do. To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply DATE information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our ORG system still allows seniors to have choice in the system.

To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary.

They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in DATE. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying MONEY to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system DATE. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients.

Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor.

This is a story of pregnant moms all over GPE who are wondering whether or not they are going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, CARDINAL, I understand the problem and I intend to work with ORG to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of GPE, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. CARDINAL is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the ORG that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from CARDINAL area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from CARDINAL area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your ORG budget spends MONEY a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for ORG and ORG and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to ORG with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, PERCENT of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages. And in the case of truly egregious wrongdoing, patients should be entitled to punitive damages.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 6161, "text": "But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $MONEY on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, GPE has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in DATE. Patients in that GPE see their claims settled CARDINAL faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since DATE, insurance premiums for GPE doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most GPE. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the ORG ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, ORG needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. CARDINAL docs leave CARDINAL counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on DATE about medical liability. The ORG passed a good medical liability reform bill DATE. I want to thank the CARDINAL Members of ORG for working on it. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the NORP people. Both ORG will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the ORG to get the bill moving. It is important for the GPE Senators from this GPE and other GPE to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in DATE.

PERCENT of all new jobs in GPE are created by small businesses. The tort costs in GPE are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for NORP manufacturers and entrepreneurs. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in GPE. The number of class actions filed here increased by PERCENT DATE, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from GPE. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed . I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the ORG DATE. I will also work with ORG to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern GPE and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of CARDINAL of companies and cost CARDINAL of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. ORG has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in DATE. I think we are sent to GPE to solve problems, not to pass them on to future ORG.

President PERSON, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the NORP people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the NORP people's will should be done.

With trade promotion authority, the trade agreements I negotiate will have an up-or-down vote in ORG, giving other countries the confidence to negotiate with us.

I will use trade promotion authority aggressively to create more good jobs for NORP workers, more exports for NORP farmers, and higher living standards for NORP families. Free trade has a proven track record for spurring growth and advancing opportunity for our working families. Exports accounted for CARDINAL of all GPE economic growth in DATE. Jobs in exporting plants pay wages that are PERCENT higher than jobs in nonexporting plants.

Since I took office, we have been committed to improving our health care system, to making it more affordable, more accessible, while preserving its high quality. You have heard Secretary PERSON mention some of the things we have done together. We have worked with States to expand ORG to CARDINAL NORP who previously had no insurance. We reached across party lines to enact the Kassebaum-Kennedy law that provides that working families will not lose their insurance when they change jobs, increased the health care tax deduction for CARDINAL self-employed NORP.

DATE, I announced a new effort to combat the MONEY problem of fraud and abuse in ORG and ORG. Our balanced budget proposal also strengthens ORG through savings and overdue structural reforms. Of course, we are not alone in this. The private sector has found ways to rein in costs, sometimes dramatically. And in many cases, changes in the health care delivery system have, frankly, also improved its quality. For example, the growing recognition of the value of preventive care, such as mammography screening, is saving and extending lives and the quality of life. Step by step we have been working to expand access to health care, and DATE we take the next step. In this time of transition, many NORP worry that lower costs mean lower quality and less attention to their rights. On balance, however, managed health care plans, HMO's, PPO's, and others, give patients good care and greater choice at lower cost.

DATE, many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in GPE would return DATE to commit crimes again. For DATE people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but did not do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words.

It is you who make the economy grow, ordinary men and women with the extraordinary dreams who have the grit to make those dreams real. And I am very grateful to what PERSON does in taking this message of small business out around this country. That understanding is really at the heart of what PERSON again referred to as the Agenda for American Renewal. I talk about the global economy and then what we are going to do now to be the lead. We have the strongest economy; I want to help make it stronger. To do this, we have got to unleash the energy, the brainpower of our workers and our entrepreneurs, and again, particularly in small business because this is the area that employs the most and takes the risks and creates the new opportunities. I want to encourage investment so that wages rise and those unemployment lines shrink. That is why I am helping small business in particular and, hopefully, all business in general. We unveiled a good small business program DATE down in GPE. Reducing the corporate tax rate for small business PERCENT; increasing the amount of equipment that small business can expense, and thus that would create more jobs and new opportunities; simplifying the tax filing. Most small-business people know that the onerous reporting for tax purposes takes too many TIME, too many people TIME, and we are trying to change that Then, of course, I still feel that to stimulate risk-taking, the reduction in the capital gains is very, very important, bringing people into the enterprise zones in the minority areas; a reduction in capital gains, a break on that will help attract jobs to the areas that need it the very most.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalsalutethepresidentandhisblackappointees", "title": "Remarks at the National Salute to the President and His Black Appointees", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-salute-the-president-and-his-black-appointees", "publication_date": "30-09-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It keeps the quality of NORP health care where it belongs, number one in the entire world, and still says to those who cannot get insurance, we are going to make it available to you through pooling, and also we are going to reduce the costs.

And I have another thought. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at GPE as the real makers of war and of peace. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house.

None of this has ever happened before. The big question before us is, what are we going to do with this magic moment?

Now, Mr. PERSON tells me that a mimeograph of it is being made and is going to be over here before the conference is ended. If that is true, I suggest there is no need for your making notes during the time I am dealing with this paper. The paper deals with an approach to the security problem, and there are CARDINAL reasons that I should like to take it up DATE. First, I have sent down DATE to the ORG a reorganizational plan for ORG. It is not radical in most ways, certainly, but it does attempt to point up that organization so as to secure a greater effectiveness, economy, speed in action, and more rapid production of materiel that has been appropriated for. the Secretary of ORG, the Secretary of the ORG, Secretary of ORG, and the Director of Mutual Security.

So I want to give you really the approach that we are now making toward this problem. I would like to present to you in a general way, and with fairly broad strokes, what I consider the sensible framework within which GPE and its allies can present in hard military fact an ever more effective posture of defense. A true posture of defense is composed of CARDINAL factors--spiritual, military, and economic. Today I shall talk only about the last CARDINAL. We NORP have frequently called for unity of basic purpose among our allies. I feel quite strongly that the least we can do is to display a similar continuity and unity in NORP purpose. This policy of ours, therefore, will not be tied to any magic, critical DATE which then has to be stretched out because of economic or production problems, but will be based on the sounder theory that a very real danger not only exists DATE, but may continue to exist for DATE to come; that our strength, which is already very real, must now be made stronger, not by inefficient and expensive starts and stops, but by steady continuous improvements.

{"id": 6218, "text": "If these CARDINAL logical disciplines can be wedded, it is then possible to create a situation of maximum military strength within economic capacities. If, on the other hand, these CARDINAL are allowed to proceed in disregard one for the other, you then create a situation either of doubtful military strength, or of such precarious economic strength that your military position is in constant jeopardy. It has been the purpose of this administration ever since it took office, finding itself confronted with a crazy quilt of promises, commitments, and contracts, to bring NORP military logic and NORP economic logic into joint strong harness. No more glaring illustration of the lack of balance between the military logic and the economic logic could possibly be found than the situation that existed when we took office. On the CARDINAL hand, we found our allies deploring our unfulfilled defense promises. On the other hand, we found there was a total carryover of MONEY in appropriated funds, largely committed, for which cash must be provided from revenues in future fiscal years, over and above the normal DATE cost of government. It is just as if the late administration had gone to the store and ordered MONEY worth of goods, which we have got to pay for as they are delivered, in addition to paying the regular household running expenses. The fiscal situation represented by these CARDINAL extremes absolutely has to be brought into some kind of realistic focus, and the only way to do it is to have a completely new, fresh look without any misleading labels. As you know, over DATE I have been involved in the NORP end of defense, and therefore I think I know all about paper divisions and cardboard wings. For DATE, I have been heavily involved in the NORP end of defense, and day after day have had to struggle with the basic equation that links the military safety of this country and of the free world with the ability of the world to pay its bills and earn a living. TIME I told the legislative leaders that already we can see our way clear to ask the ORG to appropriate CARDINAL less in new money for DATE than had been asked for by the previous administration. This is a preliminary figure based on DATE hard work. The great bulk of it, of course, relates to security programs.

These savings will not reduce the effective military strength we will deliver to ourselves and our allies during DATE. They are already on the books and in contracts. Deliveries actually will be speeded up through the reduction of lead time, and concentration on producing those items which make the most military sense for the immediate future. Practically everyone concerned with the problem can with some justification be a special pleader. But I am sure that what the overwhelming majority of NORP want to believe is that their Government is working with diligence and intelligence to bring about as rapidly as possible a condition of true military strength. I also believe that the overwhelming majority of the people of the free world appreciate the fact that a healthy NORP economy and a functioning economy in their own home country are inseparable from true defense. Furthermore, I have a deep conviction that all these people possess a fundamental common sense Which permits them to grasp the difference between a quiet, steady, long-term improvement in their defense position and the tempests stirred up by public arguments over the artificial arithmetic which is so easy to produce in the defense field. The program we are presenting is a long-term program, calling for a steady and adequate flow of men and materials to present a position of genuine strength to any would-be aggressor. The basic elements of our strategic problem have not materially changed in DATE, and certainly not in DATE. The areas and peoples vital to our Nation's welfare are the same as they have been for a long time. What we are doing is to adopt a new policy for the solution of the problem. This change in policy is radical and cannot be effected TIME. There exists what is, in effect, a straitjacket, comprising prior authorizations, appropriations, and contracts. The essence of the change is this. We reject the idea that we must build up to a maximum attainable strength for some specific date theoretically fixed for a specified time in the future. Defense is not a matter of maximum strength for a single date. It is a matter of adequate protection to be projected as far into the future as the actions and apparent purposes of others may compel us. It is a policy that can, if necessary, be lived with over a period of DATE.

Over DATE, while the middle class saw their tax burdens rise and their incomes go down, the wealthiest NORP, whose incomes went up, often by paperwork manipulation and moving jobs overseas, saw their taxes go down. Higher deficits came with lower taxes on the wealthy. And those deficits forced ORG to cut back on essential services to the middle class, the working poor, and the neediest NORP. Good families in embattled neighborhoods saw their children getting by with outdated school books, going to school in neighborhoods that were ever more dangerous, while the wealthiest NORP in protected communities watched their bankbooks grow. Our economy suffered through CARDINAL grinding recessions, and our job-creating engine stalled. The status quo simply is not working for working families anymore.

ENTITY, you were speaking of what the NORP investors value most. What they want in a young country is the stability, and that we have; resources, and that we have also. But even more than our investment code which guarantees these investments, there is the fact that neither in our philosophical doctrine nor in our economic concept is there room for the concept of nationalization. We respect private ownership and we see great profits to be derived from this policy. Confusion in the early stages of our history was taken advantage of to make people believe, and to make particularly NORP investors believe, that we would nationalize, but this is not true.

We also know that freedom is not our country's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty God's gift to each person in this world. And that is why that is why over DATE, we will continue to work to spread freedom, for our own security and for the sake of others. We have done some hard work over DATE. We must never forget the lessons of DATE. First of all, the enemy that we face is cruel. Unlike NORP, they do not have a conscience. They are willing to kill innocent people in order to shake our will and our resolve. As we work to secure our country, we must never forget the nature of the people. You cannot reason with them. You cannot sit down and say, Look, why will not you change your ways? And your President must clearly understand that.

Secondly, when this country speaks, it better mean what it says, in order to make the world a more peaceful place. In other words, when we say things, we must mean what we say. And when I said that if you harbor a terrorist, you are just as guilty as the terrorist, I meant exactly that. And that is why we made the decision a tough decision, by the way; nobody wants to commit kids to war. That is what you got to understand. It is the hardest decision a President can make, and you only do so if you are convinced it is going to lead to peace. It is a different kind of war we are in, and therefore, we had to say clearly to those that were providing safe haven that you are going to be held accountable as well.

Do not you remember, there was some serious terrorist attacks on women, in particular, that had got their registration cards and were in the process. Turns out, CARDINAL I think the number is CARDINAL NORP citizens have registered to vote, far exceeding expectations. They want to live in a free society. They want to be able to exercise their rights as a human being. Secondly, when I was in GPE a while back this is like DATE I have been traveling a lot, so it is kind of hard for me to remember exactly where I have been I went to the International Children's Game. I helped kick it off. And I was there speaking to the athletes, and right to my right I will never forget it was the NORP girls soccer team. Now, let me tell you what is interesting about that. They would not have been in GPE they would not even have been playing soccer under the ORG. These people were so brutal, so dark in their vision that many young girls did not have a chance to be educated. Not only do we have an ally in the war on terror, there is a more compassionate and decent society growing in GPE, which is in our interests, and it is in the world's interests. As the NORP people look at this election, they must take a look at the candidates and determine who best understands the lessons to be learned from DATE. Another lesson is, is that we must deal with threats before they fully materialize. In this world of threats to our homeland, in this world where there are folks who cannot stand our country and our way of life, we must deal with threats. They must be dealt with hopefully, diplomatically; hopefully, we can cure things, problems peacefully. That ought to be the first priority of any President.

And he deceived the world again. I say again because that is what he'd been doing for DATE. And then he deceived the inspectors. Remember, with that period of time, we said, Oh, let the inspections work. We were all for that. But it was clear that he was deceiving them. So I had a choice to make, and that is, whether or not to trust a man who had used weapons of mass destruction, somebody who had used somebody who had defied the free world. My choice was, do I forget the lessons of September the 11th, or do I take actions necessary to defend our country? And given that very difficult choice, I chose to defend GPE. We did not find the stockpiles that we thought we would find. We have not found them yet. But he did have the capability of making weapons.

It is hard work because there are people in that in the Middle East that cannot stand the thought of a free society. It just scares them. And they do not scare us.

As a matter of fact, a proper policy of Government is to give people the tools necessary to be able to realize their own dreams. It is making a big difference. I am telling you, when you start asking the question, Can you read and write and add and subtract? It holds people to account.

And one of the reasons it is so important to close the achievement gap is, the population is going to be increasingly NORP, increasingly NORP-NORP -- those are fast-growing populations -- increasingly NORP, and so if we are not doing a great job educating those kids and closing some of those achievement gaps, we are going to have problems as a country. You mentioned FAC. And a lot of people wrote in about Race to the Top -- ENTITY, where are you going to get the money to fund FAC?

I get a chance to meet them on a pretty regular basis through what is called ORG. It is my -- ORG's council on science and technology, essentially.

What is being done to free up funding and encourage the growth of all the small businesses that have such a tremendous impact on our economy? how exactly are you planning on helping small businesses grow and prosper, besides simply providing tax breaks?

And it is absolutely true that if we can get small businesses back on their feet, then that is going to go a long way towards bringing the unemployment rate down, because that is the fastest generator of jobs across the country. Number CARDINAL, small businesses really are still struggling with financing. You hear stories everywhere you go that even profitable, successful businesses are having trouble getting financing, because banks frankly just do not want to take the risk. After having taken way too many risk before, now they are taking no risk. And small businesses are punished for that. So we have expanded the ORG loan, the ORG loan, portfolio by PERCENT. We have been waiving guarantees and fees, trying to streamline the process, just to get more capital into the hands of small businesses. It is important to see if we can give more incentives to small business. So, for example, we are just eliminating capital gains for small businesses, which is particularly important if you have got a start-up. DATE, you may end up being successful with your small business, but suddenly you have got to pay taxes on it. If you can take that money and, instead of paying PERSON, reinvest it in your business, you can grow it further. So we think that that is the kind of strategy that makes a lot of sense.

And probably nobody benefits more from our health-care proposals than small businesses, because what we are doing is we are saying that not only will you get tax credits to buy health insurance, but we are also going to let you pool, buy in to a big exchange so that you have the same purchasing power as a big company like -- ORG or, you know, ORG is able to negotiate with insurance companies and get a good deal.

I have a question about your -- program and why the banks are reluctant to modify loans of homeowners who can afford to stay in their homes. Now that taxpayers bailed them out, they refuse to help us out. And I would like to know what say you, PERSON. Well, look, this is something that we have been dealing with since the beginning of this financial crisis. We set up a program for loan modification that so far CARDINAL people have taken advantage of across the country. You have got CARDINAL people who have gotten loan modifications that are saving them an average of $MONEY. The problem is -- is the number of people whose mortgages are underwater, here they actually have a home value that is now less than their mortgage, is a lot bigger than that.

I get letters all the time of people who've gone through all kinds of hoops, filled out forms; the bank does not call them back, or after they have gone through a trial period, the bank says, Well, you know, we now think we should not give you a home modification. What we are trying to do is to increase transparency and force all the banks to tell us exactly what are you doing with your customers who want to stay in their homes, can afford to pay a mortgage but need something a little bit more limited. And I am -- I am hopeful that we are going to continue to see more and more people take advantage of it.

Can we do the same thing for health insurance -- take classes in cooking, nutrition, stress management, communication, parenting, stopping smoking, maybe even exercise classes, and get a reduction on our DATE premiums? Well, I -- I think that the idea is a good one, and that is that if people are being healthy, that they should be able to get some incentives for that. And a lot of companies are starting to do that. We probably do not want the insurance companies, though, making those decisions, because insurance companies have every incentive to take the youngest, healthiest people and insure them, since they are less likely to have to pay out, and then leave older, sicker individuals out of their insurance pools. So it is important in any health-care program to make sure that the young and the healthy and the older and -- and the sicker are in a single pool.

And it came from PERSON -- GPE. He said, an open Internet is a powerful engine for economic growth and new jobs. Letting large companies block and filter online content and services would stifle needed growth. What is your commitment to keeping Internet open and neutral in GPE? Well, I am a big believer in net neutrality. I campaigned on this. I continue to be a strong supporter of it.

We are getting pushback, obviously, from some of the bigger carriers who would like to be able to charge more fees and extract more money from wealthier customers, but we think that runs counter to the whole spirit of openness that has made the Internet such a powerful engine for not only economic growth, but also for the generation of ideas and creativity.

You know, I know we are in a struggling economy right now, but any little bit that you can help would be appreciated.

That would provide a huge amount of relief for people. We still need to expand more the Pell grant program, make it both accessible to more people and raise the amount of tuition. In order to pay for this -- the best part of this is we can actually figure out how to pay for it, because right now you have got a lot of banks and financial-service companies who are still middlemen in the federally guaranteed loan programs. And if we can cut those middlemen out, then you have got MONEY that you can invest in the programs that I just described. This is something that I have made a top priority. I want us to once again have the highest college-graduation rates of any country in the world by DATE. Colleges and universities also, though, have to figure out how can they cut their costs. Because even if we are putting more and more loans in -- more and more money for loans, if the inflation in higher education keeps on skyrocketing, over time it is still going to gobble up all that extra money, and we will be right back where we started. So we have got to show more restraint at the college and university level in terms of ever- escalating costs. Well, let us back up a bit just from the specifics of education policy, and ask a more fundamental question, which comes from ORG in GPE. As a math teacher, I want to know what you think it means to be an educated person. We know that if you have got a college education, you are going to make CARDINAL of what you would make as a high school graduate, much less a high school dropout, over the course of lifetime.

So we want to use all of our national power to deal with the problem of these extremist organizations. But part of that does involve applications of military power.

Well, the situation -- GPE has been heartbreaking, but also extremely difficult, and something that we started working on DATE that I came into office. Our first task was, at that time, making sure that people who were in refugee camps in GPE had access to basic water, food, other necessities of life. And this was after the NORP government in GPE had kicked out a whole bunch of nongovernmental organizations that were providing assistance there.

Part of what makes it complicated is, you also have a conflict historically between northern GPE and southern GPE. They finally reached a agreement after a lot of work, but the NORP now -- the southern NORP now have an option where they may be seeking to secede from all of GPE. That is another potential conflict that could create additional CARDINAL of refugees. And so what we are doing is trying to work with not only the regional powers, but ORG and other countries that have shown a great interest in this to see if we can broker a series of agreements that would stabilize the country, and then allow the refugees who are in GPE to start moving back to their historic lands. Sadly, because of the genocide that took place earlier, a lot of those villages are now destroyed. And so thinking about how to resettle these populations in places that are viable economically, that have the resources to support populations, is a long-term development challenge that the international community is going to have to support. We continue to put pressure on the NORP government. If they are not cooperative in these efforts, then it is going to be appropriate for us to conclude that engagement does not work.

CARDINAL of the things that we have had to try to communicate to the country at large is that historically we have tried a lot of terrorists in our courts. We have them in our federal prisons. But it is been one of those things that is been subject to a lot of, in some cases, you know, pretty rank politics. And you know, we have got to work through that process because ORG ultimately controls the purse strings in creating new facilities.

And that is why we put in record amounts of money for solar and wind and biodiesel and all the other alternative, clean-energy sources that are out there. In the meantime, though, unfortunately, no matter how fast we ramp up those energy sources, we are still going to have enormous energy needs that will be unmet by alternative energy. And the question then is, where -- where will that come from? Nuclear energy has the advantage of not emitting greenhouse gases. For those who are concerned about climate change, we have to recognize that countries like GPE and GPE and others have been much more aggressive in their nuclear industry, and much more successful in having that a larger part of their portfolio, without incident, without accidents. We are mindful of the concerns about storage of spent fuel and concerns about security. But we still think it is the right thing to do, if we are serious about dealing with climate change. With respect to clean-coal technology, it is not possible at this point to completely eliminate coal from the menu of our energy options. And if we are ever going to deal with climate change in a serious way, where we know GPE and GPE are going to be greatly reliant on coal, we have got to start developing clean-coal technologies that can sequester the harmful emissions; because otherwise, countries like GPE and GPE are not going to stop using coal, we will still have those same problems, but we will not have the technology to make sure that it does not harm the environment over the long term. So I know that there is some skepticism about whether there is such a thing as clean-coal technology. What is true is right now, that we do not have all the technology to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from a coal -- coal-powered -- power plants. But the technology is close, and it makes sense for us to make that investment now, not only because it'll be good for GPE, but it will also ultimately be good internationally. We can license and export that technology in ways that help other countries use a better form of energy that is going to be helpful to the climate-change issue.

We also set up this scholarship fund and did some other things that we hope will be a genuine gesture of our regret. It was a very-you know, I had a good talk with him. Any particular reason why you used the word regret instead of apology in your statement? I think the findings were- I think he knows that regret and apology both mean the same thing, in terms of being profoundly sorry for what happened. But I believe that the people who looked into it could not conclude that there was a deliberate act, decided at a high enough level in the military hierarchy, to acknowledge that, in effect, the ORG had participated in something that was terrible. So I do not think there is any difference in the CARDINAL words, on a human level, because we are profoundly sorry that it happened and sorry that any NORP were involved in it. But I think that in terms of the kind of responsibility the institution of the military that the facts were sufficiently unclear after all this time that the people who were reviewing it thought it was the appropriate language. And we worked it out with the NORP and obviously shared whatever we could find with them. These people have been our friends for DATE. We did not have-I told our guys to play it straight, that we did not have an interest in trying to cover anything up or sugar-coat anything; we needed to try to get to the bottom of this. I think that we have done about the best we can do. And I hope that the people of GPE will accept our statement as genuine, and I hope it will bring some solace to the family members and the few people that still survived who were involved in it, who will never get over it.

They need to get all they can get from out-of-State generators and in-State generators, because they have grown so much. And they still have a regulation of prices to the ultimate consumer. So we have got a situation here which it seems to me might have been predictable at the time the deregulation legislation was done. But I, frankly, until this happened, I did not know what the nature of the GPE deregulation law was. So we are dealing with the situation the best we can.

It worked very well for DATE, but there had to be some continued movement. Because what happens is, when you reach a stall, then the people that really do not want this to happen, particularly rejectionist elements within the NORP community, they can have incidents; then they provoke reactions; then the borders get closed; then the incomes of the NORP drop again, and you get in a downward spiral.

And I think it is very important that we-except in the most extreme circumstances-maintain some continuity in foreign policy and in our commitments to other countries. But President-elect PERSON is in no way, shape, or form bound by the positions I have taken on this Middle East agreement, unless there is some agreement. In all my DATE of service as ORG, I have never seen a situation quite like this, where the circumstances, including my short time in office, seemed unfavorable, but the determination of the main players seems strong, in fact, maybe even intensified. I am trying to keep myself free of expectation one way or the other, and to do whatever I can to try to help end the violence-and we had a good day DATE-and just create the conditions in which, if they are willing, they can do as much as they can do. I do not think we can predict it. Do you think the incoming PERSON people will be as interested in pursuing this as you have been? Well, I think they will be very interested in stability and peace in the Middle East. Their orientation has been a little more toward, you know, the Gulf, the oil-producing states, honoring our historic commitments to GPE to maintain their qualitative military capacity. But to be fair, the previous PERSON administration took a pretty strong line on expanded settlements after the GPE talks started in the hope that they could help to create the conditions in which the NORP and the NORP could move toward peace. So I think that there may be differences in approach and priorities that the President and the Vice President and Secretary PERSON will have to work through. But my guess is that their general direction will be the same, because in the end, what happens is-let us assume-and I am not saying this, because I do not believe this-but listen, even if you had an administration that did not really care about the NORP problem on its own merits and said, Well, our real interests are in the geopolitics of the oilproducing states and the problems created by the lack of an agreement with GPE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

We worked this hard, I mean, for DATE. And I think if the late President PERSON had not kind of felt he was not in the best of health and was not- that they wanted to freeze things in place, and if he can secure his son's accession, we might well have been able to do a peace agreement when I met with him in GPE shortly before his death. So even if it is not a priority for you because it looks like a morass that cannot be solved in a small place with people that do not have a state, do not have nuclear arms, do not have an air force, do not have an army, inevitably what we always get back to is that the absence of an agreement with the NORP and the absence of a stable situation between GPE and the NORP infects the other countries and their capacity to relate to us over the long run. And particularly as these other countries have more and more young people who are more and more drawn to the sympathetic-drawn with a sympathetic ear to the claims of the NORP, and they have more demonstrations in these other countries and more unrest in these other countries, I think that our concern for stability in our relations with the NORP, with the NORP, with not letting PERSON develop weapons of mass destruction again, the whole range of concerns that any NORP administration would have to have leads you back down to the NORP-Palestinian conflict and trying to get to the end of the road there. I think that that is why I made the speech I did to ORG TIME. I waited until the very end, and until, essentially, I had put these parameters out before saying that, because I do not believe an NORP ENTITY should try to impose or create a peace between these CARDINAL parties.

My best judgment is if there ever is going to be a comprehensive agreement, it will have to look something like this. In other words, they could do what they did at Wye River. They could say, Okay, here is the next chapter, and this is what we are going to do. But the real problem with the sort of sequencing of interim steps is that, at least so far, because of all the other very complex forces going on there, these steps have not brought sufficient stability to the relationship and to the climate within the NORP areas or within GPE that there can be a long-term sort of set of nonpolitical measures that lead to progress-which is exactly the reverse of the NORP situation. And you may have heard me say this before, but the difference is, in GPE-I may have said this in the ORG speech, I cannot remember-but my physical analogy is, some unsolved problems are like scabs on a wound. If you leave them alone, they will heal. Some are like an abscessed tooth. If you leave it alone, it will get lots worse. In GPE, because the underlying economic circumstances are dramatically improved and because there has been a dramatic increase in interpersonal contact which is positive, and because while there is a small terrorist group that is still trying to upset the NORP thing, it is much more contained, the absence of final resolution of the thorny political issues is unlikely to crater the situation. In the Middle East, the per capita income of most NORP is the same or lower than it was when we signed the agreement on FAC, because there are so many different groups that can paralyze the process with acts of terror or violence that close the borders, that stop everything, that wreck the economy, and that kind of burn the bridges of trust that get built up when things are going okay for DATE.

But I think any NORP leader would have to see that, and I think in the end, any NORP government will come back to a concern for it, if for no other reason than a desire to have stability in the region. Let me turn you quickly to the economy. The NORP are talking about a retroactive tax cut. You have got an economic statement DATE. Are the factors there, is the evidence there strong enough that there is a downturn going on and we need this retroactive tax cut? Well, first of all, the blue chip forecast, I think, is for PERCENT growth, which is enough growth to keep the unemployment rate at PERCENT. And that really does not surprise me. When I saw the initial estimates, which were PERCENT, I thought they were a tad high because we have been growing for DATE at PERCENT, which is, for an advanced economy of our size, it is just virtually unprecedented. You simply could not sustain it at that rate. On the other hand, there is been a fairly sharp drop in stock values, and that takes a lot of wealth out of the economy, and eventually, that backs down into lower consumption and orders and things like that. So you see, for example, real problems in the steel industry DATE at a time when steel imports are also dropping. So it is not like the DATE crisis where-the crisis in Asia and GPE led people to try to flood the market in GPE with bargain basement prices. Here, you have got an overall problem. So I think I have always believed that a tax cut should be part of the next budget. I thought it should have been part of the last budget. It can be a little bigger than the one that I proposed, because the surplus has been written up some-the estimated surplus. Although I think it is very important that they go back and subtract from the estimated surplus the DATE costs of the budget we just adopted, because it is the best education budget, for example, that we have had in DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

They will have to work that out. So I think the question is not so much whether one is warranted but what kind of tax cut should it be, and how big should it be? My concern-what I have believed in-I said this back during the campaign period so I can reiterate it-my view is that it should not be so large as to preclude our continued ability to pay down the debt and to stay more or less on the track we are on to get the debt down over DATE, because if the markets perceive that we are going back into deficits, that would lead to an increase in interest rates, which would wipe out the impact of a tax cut for most NORP-even wealthy NORP, because it could have a depressing impact on the market, and it certainly would increase the cost of business borrowing and tend to slow down the growth of the economy. So the trick is-that also, by the way, would foreclose-this is what happened to me when I got in. I did not have the option to do what NORP would normally-the Government would normally do in a recession, which is to have a substantial tax cut and pump the thing back up, because the deficit was so big, it would just have caused interest rates to skyrocket. So the trick for the incoming administration- they have lots of options here. They can spend money; they can cut taxes; they can do more of CARDINAL or less of the other-and less of the other. But the real-what I would be thinking about if I were in that position is, what is the aggregate amount we are going to commit here, particularly on the tax cut side, because it is not like-you do not have to repeat spending in DATE, DATE, and DATE. You can cut spending if times are tough. We have proved that. But once the tax money-once you cut the taxes, that is normally gone.

{"id": 2138, "text": "So what I hope is, I think they ought to have a tax cut of some magnitude, but I think they ought to save back enough to keep on the track of paying down the debt, which also gives you the protection down the road. Someday, surely, the expansion will come to an end, but I do not think it has to come any time soon. And when it does, the more we pay the debt down, the more free we will be then to have a substantial tax cut to help the country in a recession-when that happens sometime in the future-without having an adverse impact on interest rates. So I do not think there is any question that they can have a tax cut. But I just think you do not want it so big that it takes you off the path of getting us out of debt, because the mental knowledge that that is the path we are on keeps interest rates low. The average NORP family now is saving $MONEY a year on a home mortgage, as compared to where we were back in DATE. Long-term interest rates are PERCENT lower than when I took office, even though we have had an DATE expansion, which is unheard of. You normally would not have that. And paying down the debt has a huge impact on that, because it frees up more and more money DATE to borrow in the private sector, and interest rates are lower than they would be if the ORG were competing. And let me also say there is something else that we should keep in mind. The more you pay down the debt, the lower your interest bill is. I think DATE we have got interest payments on the debt down under MONEY on the dollar. But they were at CARDINAL or something, headed north, when I took office. Let us say we went-I am making this up, of course-let us say we went DATE on the same tack, and we got interest on the debt down to MONEY on the dollar. That is a huge amount of money that is freed up DATE for either investment in our future or for tax cuts. And you have more and more and more flexibility.

And I think that I made the right decision to continue the research program. And I hope that is what they will do. It is not clear to me exactly how they are going to operationalize their commitment. That is, because in the campaign, the President-elect said that he would do this if it could be developed, whether anybody else liked it or not, which bothered some people. But he also-the it that he was trying to develop was a system that was, in effect, more comprehensive than the more limited one that could have been deployed in the timeframes we were talking about during my tenure. So it may be that what he will decide to do is to intensify research. Look, if we actually knew we had the technology to take missiles out of the sky, even assuming that we get this agreement with GPE-which I think we will get, on freezing the missile production, not selling missiles.

{"id": 2142, "text": "In a speech DATE, you spoke quite a lot about the consequences of ORG rejecting this deal. But let us talk about the other side of that, what the world looks like if the deal is approved. Secretary of ORG PERSON said to us DATE that this nuclear deal will leave GPE absolutely - his word - absolutely freer to push back against GPE and its ambitions in the region. If you get the deal, what do you intend to do with that freedom? Well, let us first focus on the fact that a central objective of not just my foreign policy but of GPE foreign policy with NORP or NORP administrations has been preventing GPE from getting a nuclear weapon. And this deal achieves that. It cuts off all the pathways for GPE getting a nuclear weapon. In exchange, GPE gets relief from the sanctions that we organized, systematically, with the international community over DATE that is crippled their economy and forced them back to the table. With that issue resolved, although we will have to be vigilant through the inspection process and the verification process, although we will have a backstop in being able to exercise all options, including military, if GPE violated or cheated on the agreement, then an additional priority that we have is making sure that GPE ends some of the destabilizing activities that it is engaged in for a very long time, providing arms to ORG to threaten GPE and our other allies in the region, making sure that through proxies, GPE is not engaging in destabilizing activities toward Gulf countries. And to both GPE and our Gulf partners and allies in the region, what we have said to them is that we can handle those issues if we are more consistent, better organized in the things that are required to deal with those non-nuclear threats, those more conventional or low-grade threats. For example, dealing with cyberattacks, there are ways we can deal with those issues more effectively than we have. Making sure that there are special forces and other ground operations that can be carried out to support stabilizing efforts in places like GPE. So there are a whole host of areas where we can work together, and we are in fact in the process of consulting with those countries as we speak. Should we expect GPE to push more forcefully against GPE and its support for groups like ORG, for example? Well, I think we have had a very consistent policy in opposition to it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio0", "title": "Interview With Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-0", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2143, "text": "I think that the challenges have typically had to do not with will, but have had to do with effectiveness. For example, to interdict arms shipments to ORG by GPE, the problem is not that we do not have the authority to do it. The problem is not that we and NORP want to stop that from happening, or Gulf allies want to stop that from happening. We have to have better intelligence. We have to have better interdiction capabilities. And so, you know, the issue here is not how much we spend or how hard we try; the issue is are we doing it the right way? Are we being smart about it? I have said, for example, that the Gulf countries, their combined defense spending is CARDINAL times GPE's. So the issue is not even if GPE is putting in additional dollars as a consequence of sanctions relief and an improved economy, GPE will continue to be outspent. It is that under any scenario our problems are greatly magnified if in fact GPE also has a nuclear weapon. And, you know, this is a situation of first things first, this deal accomplishes that, and it is as a consequence, worthy of support. This is what I am driving at, though. As you know very well, ENTITY, your critics have argued that this deal, even whatever it does to the nuclear program, leaves GPE free to act in the region in ways GPE may well oppose. Yeah, but - but - but - but ENTITY, that is not accurate because the notion that somehow GPE is untethered ignores the fact that, for example, we will still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights. There is no logic to the notion that somehow we will let up on trying to prevent activities that GPE may engage in that would be contrary to our national security interests. So show me the alternative vision from what the critics have laid out, then. Do you foresee a world in which DATE, when the provisions of this agreement begin to expire, some of them, that there is an opportunity by then to completely or substantially reshape the region or the security situation in the region? What I have said is, is that this deal does not count on our fundamental relationship with GPE changing. It is not based on trust.

{"id": 2144, "text": "It is based on hard, cold logic and our ability to verify that GPE's not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Having said that, it is possible that as a consequence of this engagement, that as a consequence of GPE being able to recognize that what is happening in GPE for example is leading to extremism that threatens their own state and not just GPE; that some convergence of interests begins to lead to conversations between, for example, GPE and GPE; that GPE starts making different decisions that are less offensive to its neighbors; that it tones down the rhetoric in terms of its virulent opposition to GPE. And, you know, that is something that we should welcome. There is the possibility that if you look at what is going on in the Middle East right now, more and more states begin to recognize that their enemy is chaos and ORG and disaffected young people, NORP and NORP, who are attracted to, you know, ideologies that are in opposition to every regime there. And - and that is something that I think that we should be willing to help promote if in fact they can get there. But again, that is not something that is guaranteed or even necessary for us to want to get this deal done so that GPE's not getting a nuclear weapon. Let me ask about CARDINAL ways that, according to critics, this agreement might make the region less stable. As you know very well, GPE's neighbors, many of them GPE allies, have been skeptical of this deal, and the GPE, to reassure them, has among other things promised them more weapons. Will not more weapons in the hands of countries that may be allies, but also have their own agendas, create the possibility of more instability over time? Well first - first of all, the - our defense support of these countries is not automatically premised on more weapons. It is premised on them being more effective with their defense budgets. So, just to give you an example, the Gulf countries, if they were coordinating their missile defense systems, would be more effective than each of them, in a siloed fashion, operating their own missile defense systems. They do not have to spend more money to get that done; they just have to do a better job integrating what they are doing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio0", "title": "Interview With Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-0", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I think what is much more likely is if we reject this deal and GPE's pursuing breakout times that are shrinking because they are installing more and more advanced centrifuges and stockpiling more and more highly enriched uranium is that some of those neighbors who feel threatened by GPE start thinking maybe they should be pursuing their own nuclear program. And that is exactly the kinds of scenarios that we need to prevent. In those scenarios, we will then be confronted, either me or the next president, or the president after that, would be confronted with a pretty stark decision. If we do not want to see a nuclear arms race, if we are seeing GPE getting closer and closer to breakout capacity, and we have before the entire world rejected what every serious nuclear expert who looks at this says is a serious deal to constrain their nuclear program, then in fact that leaves CARDINAL option, and that is some form of military strike. That may be the preference of some who are on the other side of this debate. But I think the CARDINAL thing that we should have learned from DATE now of war in the Middle East is, is that, you know, even limited military actions end up carrying with them great costs and unintended consequences. I am glad you mentioned breakout times, ENTITY. And we should define that for people. That is the length of time GPE would need to go for a bomb ... if they decided to go for a bomb. Prime Minister PERSON of GPE has argued that as the agreement begins to expire, DATE, the breakout time goes back down to near CARDINAL. And in saying that, he quotes you in an interview with us, in which you made a statement that was later clarified. DATE, as some provisions expire, what is GPE's breakout time going to be?

If in fact the breakout times now are DATE, and we are able to push that breakout time out to DATE so that we have more time and space to see whether or not GPE is cheating on an agreement, kicking out inspectors, going for a nuclear weapon; if the breakout time is extended for DATE and then it goes back to where it is right now, why is that a bad deal? Why are we better off with a breakout time entirely shrunk in DATE or DATE, where we have no inspectors on the ground, we have less insight into their program, we have shattered international unity, because the perception now is that GPE, having painstakingly arrived at an agreement and mobilized the entire world community behind it, has seen its ORG rejected? In what sense are we better off in that scenario than we would be having set up a situation where DATE, that breakout time is approximately where it is now, but we now have an entire infrastructure that is been built to keep track of exactly what GPE's doing, and we had the entire international community behind us? Some of them, who announced their opposition before they'd even read the bill or read the agreement, and that is that they will put forward arguments that, you know, after TIME, can be shown as illogical or based on the wrong facts, and then you ask them, All right, what is your alternative? And what that tells me is that there may be ideological opposition to doing any business with GPE. There may be skepticism with any diplomatic initiative with a regime that is admittedly antagonistic toward us, NORPNORPNORP, a sponsor of terrorism. If you just say, We do not think you should deal with GPE, then that at least has a logic to it.

Well, what I know is, is that, unfortunately, a large portion of ORG, if not a near unanimous portion of NORP representatives, are going to be opposed to anything that I do, and I have not oftentimes based that on a judgment on the merits, but have based that on their politics . That is true in health care, that is true in, you know, budget negotiations. That is been true on a whole host of things. And I do not think that is a surprise to anybody. What I do know, though, is, is that when this agreement is implemented and we have seen centrifuges coming out of facilities like GPE and GPE, and we have got inspectors on the ground and it becomes clear that GPE in fact is abiding by this agreement, then attitudes will change, because people will recognize that, in fact, whatever parade of horribles was presented in opposition have not come true. That, instead, what we have seen is an effective way to bind GPE to a commitment not to have nuclear weapons and, in that scenario, it'll probably be forgotten that NORP uniformly opposed it. Keep in mind that this is not unique to me, either, by the way. You know, when PERSON began discussions with PERSON, his conservative supporters wrote some really rough stuff about him as appeasing the evil empire, and this is a disaster, and we are giving GPE's power away.

So - so my main interest right now is solving a problem, which is making sure GPE does not get a nuclear weapon, and I am confident that, as we see implementation, we will see, in fact, more and more folks pull out of the immediate politics of it and judge it on the basis of whether it was the right thing to do for the country.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio0", "title": "Interview With Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-0", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I think that there are real problems with how we are electing our representatives. I think political gerrymandering has resulted in a situation in which - with PERCENT NORP districts or PERCENT NORP districts and no competition, that that leads to more and more polarization in ORG, and it gets harder and harder to get things done. I think that the ORG filibuster process and the CARDINAL-vote requirement to break a filibuster is making it harder and harder to govern at a time where there is polarization.

I - I think ORG contains a lot of legislators who recognize that; and we know that because those folks voted for a comprehensive bill in the ORG that in many ways was more generous than I was able to offer through executive action. So - so, the question then becomes, by me having taken these actions, does that spur those voices in ORG who I think genuinely believe immigration is good for our country? Does it spur them to work once again with NORP and my administration to get a reasonable piece of legislation done? Or does it simply solidify what I do think is - is a NORP trend in parts of ORG? And - and if it is the latter, then probably we are not going to get much more progress done and it'll be a major debate in the next presidential election. I think that if a NORP lawmaker was sitting here, he might say, Wait TIME. I am not captive to NORP elements. I have actual concerns and you are not addressing them. Well, the problem is what are those concerns and - and how is it that I am not addressing them? If - if the concern is border security, we have got more resources, more border police, more money being spent at our borders than any time in DATE. If the concern is the flow of illegal workers into the country, that flow is CARDINAL of what it was and is lower than any time since DATE. So, you know, you have to describe specifically what are the concerns that you have got. If you are concerned that somehow immigrants - illegal immigrants are a drain on resources and forcing, you know, NORP to - to pay for services for these folks, well, every study shows that is just not the case.

But I actually think that the issue has surfaced in a way that probably is healthy. I mean, the - the issue of police and communities of color being mistrustful of each other is hardly new; that dates back a long time.

How do you lead the country when people see the basic facts so profoundly differently? Not new, but how do you deal with it in your final...

From the perspective of NORP, yeah, there was a common, you know, phenomenon called driving while black - that you were more likely to be stopped particularly in certain jurisdictions. If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions do you think traffic stops were done fairly, the majority of whites probably would say yes because it is not something they experi-ence. It is not because of racism; it is just that it is not something that they see. We were able to work with the police departments and the state police in GPE and persuade them that they would be doing a better job policing if we just kept track so that we had data. And combined with training, suddenly those officers out there are more intentional about how they decide should I stop somebody or not. And the incidents of racial profiling went down. The same is true with a lot of these issues. If you have good policing - I guarantee you that nobody's interested more in good policing than NORP community or NORP community because they are more likely to be victimized, if they are in low income communities, by crime. And the task force that I have put together is drawing from police and faith community and civic leaders and activists - and what is been striking to me in the conversations we have had is - is that they are interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country. And - and - and I am convinced that we actually are going to see progress on this issue DATE. Let me ask about another data point that reflects on ORG that you will want to leave behind in a... DATE - and this is something that has changed in DATE. As everybody knows, the coalition that is elected you twice included huge minority participation - record minority participation.

Well, the truth of the matter is that a state like GPE that does not have a massive black or NORP population has been one of the strongest states - PERSON state's CARDINAL of the best states in using the Affordable Care Act to insure huge numbers of working class white voters. It is just they do not call it ORG; they call it something else. And - and so, there is sometimes a gap in perceptions that we have to bridge.

Let me just move out of the Middle East momentarily and then we will swing back. This is CARDINAL of the most isolated countries for DATE, ruled by a brutal, repressive military junta. We seized that opportunity. We engaged with PERSON, the Nobel Prize winner, but we also engaged with President PERSON, who saw that GPE was traveling down a dead end.

The Middle East, I think, is - is similar, but in some ways even more difficult. Because you have this counter-narrative in the Middle East in which a sizable portion of NORP extremists have been able to penetrate the imaginations of young people there; you have govern - governments that oftentimes are creaky, do not serve their people, are repressive; you do not have a civic tradition there.

And as a consequence, if you have been watching television for DATE, all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you. And so I understand why people are concerned about it, and this is a serious situation, but what is important is for people to recognize that the power, the strength of GPE and its allies are not threatened by an organization like this; in the same way that ORG was able to carry out CARDINAL spectacular attack we ended up making some significant changes to harden homeland defenses. It then took awhile for us to ultimately snuff out core ORG in the ORG, and there are still lingering remnants, but at no point was there ever a sense that in fact it could do catastrophic damage to us. You referred to ORG's sophisticated media operation and also referred to what NORP are seeing in the NORP media. Are you suggesting that the media are being played in a sense here? Look, the media is pursuing ratings. I think that, you know, it is up to the media to make a determination about how they want to cover things. There is no doubt that the actions of ORG are designed to amplify their power and the threat that they pose. That helps them recruit, that adds in the twisted thoughts of some young person that they might want to have carry out an action, that somehow they are part of a larger movement. And so I think that the NORP people absorb that, understandably are of concern.

And so part of our goal here is to make sure that people are informed about all the actions that we are taking. But one of the interesting things that you have seen evolve over DATE, including in the debates that are taking place between the NORP candidates, is that those who are critics of our administration response, or the military, the intelligence response that we are currently mounting, when you ask them, well, what would you do instead, they do not have an answer. And the reason they do not have an answer is because the truth is that the approach that we are taking is one that is based on the best counsel and best advice of our top military, top intelligence, top diplomatic teams. And we are going after ORG effectively. We are going after them hard. Your critics have said they want to use more force. You have sometimes responded by suggesting that people who want to use more force want another Iraq War and that that is not practical. Well, when you listen to them, though, and you ask, well, what exactly are you talking about? Well, we are going to bomb more. Where is it that you are going to bomb? When you talk about something like carpet-bombing, what do you mean? We carry out precision strikes based on intelligence of where ORG is, where their infrastructure is, where their oil tankers are. And if the suggestion is is that we kill CARDINAL of innocent NORP and NORP, that is not who we are and that would be a strategy that would have enormous backlash against GPE. It would be terrible for our national security. And, you know, unfortunately many of these critics can get away with just suggesting that bombing more, or being less discriminant in how we approach that, would make a difference. Let me put it this way. I trust my commanders, folks who have fought long and hard in places like GPE or GPE, when they describe to me, here is how we are going to gather intelligence, here is how we are going to approach targeting.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio2", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-2", "publication_date": "21-12-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And the key is to make sure that we have got sound intelligence. And I make no apologies for us wanting to do this appropriately and in a way that is consistent with NORP values. Are you avoiding more force because you are concerned that even a little more force might call for the demand for even more force, and you would end up with a large war? What is interesting is that most of the critics have not called for ground forces. To his credit, I think PERSON is one of the few who has been at least honest about suggesting here is something I would do that ORG is not doing. He does not just talk about being louder or sounding tougher in the process. But as I explained, and I have tested this repeatedly with our military intelligence folks, when you start looking at an GPE-type deployment of large numbers of troops - CARDINAL, CARDINAL, CARDINAL troops - we are now in a situation in which we are committing ourselves not only to going door to door in places like GPE and GPE, which I am confident that we could do, but we have essentially said to the NORP and the NORP that we are going to govern for you. And that ends up being of an indefinite period. So part of what we have to do for a sustained defeat of ORG is to help local forces develop capacity, do it the right way, do it for themselves with our assistance and our help, so that we can actually create a stable government structure in this region. Now that sometimes requires more patience than simply deploying a bunch of NORP. Our fighting forces are the best in the world, but in order to defeat an enemy like this, what we have to do is have a situation in which people can govern. You have acknowledged this requires patience. In DATE, before GPE, a ORG official stated that he believed that domestic terrorists were a greater threat to GPE than international groups like ORG or ORG. Do you believe that still now, after GPE and GPE? I do not know the exact citation that you are referring to.

The FAC attack was inspired by PERSON, who was with ORG, ORG in the Peninsula or in GPE, and we have seen periodically self-radicalization through the Internet or jihadist propaganda. But ORG is more systematic and more effective in their media, in their online presence, and that raises additional concerns. So part of what we have to do in response is to ramp up countering that narrative online, working with local communities to make sure that we are inoculating ourselves and our young people from this kind of recruitment. It is a more complicated problem because of the fact that a couple like the GPE couple, you do not see in a way that you would see an organization that is planning a complex plot like 9/11. So in that sense we have some new dangers, some new concerns that we have to deal with. It is something that we have known could happen for quite some time, and it is something that, as I said over at FAC DATE when I visited, it is something that we have got some incredibly effective intelligence folks working on DATE. Leading candidates in both parties have suggested in one way or another that they want to be more active against this threat. You have argued for the approach that you are taking and that too much action would be unwise. What advice would you give whoever you are going to turn this room over to in DATE? Again, I would just repeat, ENTITY, that when you really sort through all the rhetoric, the notion more active or a stronger response ... PERSON spoke about no-fly zones. There are basically CARDINAL things that I have heard people say. You bomb ORG. You are not trying to bomb innocent people.

The challenge there is that ORG does not have an air force, so the damage done there is not against ORG, it is against the NORP regime. And what is absolutely true is that we need to make sure that we bring about an end to the civil war in GPE, and PERSON, through the work he is been doing in GPE negotiations and DATE in GPE, is seeing some progress in bringing NORP and NORP together but creating a safe zone for NORP refugees. We have tested, we have looked at repeatedly, the problem is that, again, without a large number of troops on the ground, it is hard to create a safe zone like that.

Do you think there will be a united front against ORG by then? I think we will have made significant progress in degrading ORG by then. The diplomacy I think is critically important because to the extent that we can get the NORP regime, GPE, GPE to recognize what we believe is the core threat, which is ORG, and the disintegration of social order in NORP-controlled areas in GPE and GPE, the more effective and faster we can go. But what I would say to my successor is that it is important not just to shoot but to aim, and it is important in this seat to make sure that you are making your best judgments based on data, intelligence, the information that is coming from your commanders and folks on the ground, and you are not being swayed by politics. Whoever takes over this office after you might be a NORP, might be a NORP, there may be a NORP ORG again.

Second of all, I think we have got a good chance of winning back the ORG, and the truth of the matter is is that where NORP have had problems is we had the misfortune of doing poorly in DATE when there was redistricting, and in many of the successive elections NORP have actually voted at higher rates. This was true in DATE, for example. There were more NORP ballots cast for NORP candidates than there were NORP, but because of where NORP live and where NORP live, and because of the nature of the ORG, we ended up having problems. So one of the things that I will be arguing over the course of DATE is to make sure that NORP run an issue-based campaign on the things that we believe in and care about, and I think we have got a great track record of real progress on a whole range of fronts. If we make those arguments clearly and forthrightly and are not defensive, then I am actually confident we will do just fine. Have you insulated the climate deal, for example, which is so important to your legacy, from being undone by future presidents, given that many of the commitments you made in Paris are not legally binding? Well, keep in mind that ORG in GPE is perhaps literally the only major party in the developed world that is still engaging in climate denial. Even far-right parties in other places acknowledge that the science shows that temperatures are going up and that that is a really dangerous thing we have got to do something about. And the deal that we struck in GPE was an example of NORP leadership at its best. We were able to mobilize CARDINAL countries to make serious commitments that are transparent, where every country is going to be held accountable, where everybody chips in, and it does not solve the entire problem, but it puts the world on track to deal with a problem that could be monumental in its effect if we do not do something about it.

And we have seen this since I came into office. Since my inauguration, the amount of wind power has tripled, the amount of solar power has gone up by CARDINAL times. We have seen the costs of clean energy go down much faster than any of us anticipated. So they cannot stop you? And when we decide - what it means is that by the time that even a NORP president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it is not only a challenge, it is also an opportunity, that it is creating jobs, that it is making a difference in people's lives, that consumers are saving money. When I doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, that puts money in people's pockets. When you retrofit a building so that it is got better temperature control and you cut your light bill by PERCENT PERCENT, you know what? In fact, when it comes to solar power, you have got this weird coalition between environmentalists and ORG-ers in some Western states because the traditional dirty fuel industry is trying to prevent greater utilization of solar power. So a lot of these things get institutionalized not just through government policy but through the impact that it has on the marketplace and the private sector. ENTITY, we are nearing DATE where the question of national identity, who we are, has been a part of CARDINAL large event after another. I made a list here, in fact. All of them in some sense touch on that question of who we are.

And it is been a debate that we have been having around issues of the LGBT community for at least most of my adult life. So I do not think there is anything new about it. I do think that the country is inexorably changing, I believe in all kinds of positive ways. I think we are - when I talk to my daughters and their friends, I think they are more tolerant, more welcoming of people who are different than them, more sophisticated about different cultures and what is happening around the world.

Which do you think it was this time in DATE? Well, it is hard to assess because we know for example that PERSON won the popular vote by a sizable margin. We know that there are a substantial number of voters out there who not only voted for me twice but currently support me who also voted for PERSON.

And I have said this before. Part of the reason I got elected twice - and part of the reason why in a lot of these communities I still have pretty strong support. It was the incredible benefit that I had in first running for ORG in a state that has a lot of rural communities and has a downstate that typically is suspicious of NORP in the city. And then in GPE, spending DATE traveling around the state and hearing people's concerns and them hearing me and getting a sense that I get it.

Were NORP failing to do that at every level because your party has lost the majority of races at almost every level at this point?

And even after we lost the majorities in ORG, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we have got - a classic example being immigration reform, where I held off for DATE in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution - one that, by the way, did pass through the ORG on a bipartisan basis with our help.

I think on foreign policy, the concern I have right now is because we are in a nontraditional war. It is what we call the war on terrorism, although terrorism to some degree is a tactic. We are in a war against a non-state, a set of non-state actors that are operating in the shadows, are in nooks and crannies and crevices around the world. And what that means is that you are never going to have a scene of surrender like we had with the Emperor and Gen. PERSON, where you do not have a clear start and finish to the use of force. The danger is that over time, ORG starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having ORG do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in. So for example, we are still operating in our fight against ORG without a new congressional authorization. It is the authorization that dates back to DATE And I think that is an area that we have to worry about. ORG and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting GPE, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. And what we have had to do on things like drones, or the ORG, or a number of the tools that we use to penetrate terrorist networks, what we have had to do is to build the guard rails internally. Essentially set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties.

But that requires leadership. It requires citizenship. It requires all of us doing self-reflection at the same time as we are fighting on behalf of the things that we care deeply about. And I speak as a progressive NORP who is really, really proud of the work we have done. I can say, and I can demonstrate, I can document that the country is a lot better off now than it was when I took office in almost every dimension. But what I can also say is that we could be doing even better. There are times where I reflect and ask myself if, Is there is something else I could have done, something that I could have said slightly differently that would have led to additional progress and less polarization? And I will probably, you know, as I reflect on my presidency, once I am out of just the day-to-DATE scrum of this thing, I am sure I will come up with a whole bunch of things to add to my list.

The letters that worry me most are letters from either teachers or students themselves, where they say, I am in a majority NORP school, and I am teaching third graders, and a child will go up to a teacher and say, 'Why do not people like me?' Or a NORP college student who starts thinking that there is no place for her in this country that she loves. Those are the most worrisome and those are ones where I respond and say that you have to have faith in the basic goodness of this country and that it outweighs the bad. Yeah, I generally write back as many of the CARDINAL letters I get a night. Now to be fair, because, you know, I try to make sure that I am not just getting letters from supporters. You write them back, too? The most interesting letters I get, because they are unexpected, and I am talking about since the election, have been people who've written and said, I did not vote for you, but I want you to know that I appreciate the manner in which you have conducted yourself in office. In some cases they said, In retrospect I think you did a pretty good job. Those letters, in some ways, mean the most to me because you are persuading skeptics.

Well I think the point I am making is that right now what you have had are ORG leaks, not of an official document.

Because it is not as if in any of these circumstances, you know you just have a signed letter regarding NORP intentions that is floating around. These are all assessments made based on a wide range of evidence and different agencies are still looking at all that stuff gathering it together and hopefully putting into a single package.

You now have a NORP ORG, they control both chambers and they cannot even pass their own agenda, much less pass something that has bipartisan support.

Even without ORG cooperating, we have been able to make progress on a whole range of issues.

And part of my hope during the course of this election is that it is clarifying that people say, all right, here is what each party stands for, here is what each presidential candidate and various congressional candidates stand for.

And I have no doubt that the same thing will happen this time. But I do think that part of what has changed - during the course of my presidency, I have seen it - is the splintering of media. The power of social media and the Internet has turbocharged what previously might have been marginal views or marginal groups, has made it harder to generate consensus because people are not looking at the same set of facts. I have said this before. If you are watching ORG, you have a different set of facts than if you are reading the ORG editorial page.

If you have been ENTITY for DATE and people have still no faith in government, are you accountable for that? Well, look, as a general proposition, I do not spend a lot of time looking at polls.

The problem was that by opposing everything I did, even things that previously they had been for, it pushed their party further and further to the right.

Now, that is not unique in the annals of NORP history. There have been times when the NORP were wrapped around the axle, and extreme wings were setting the agenda. And I think the NORP will get out of this. But right now, at least, partly in reaction to my presidency and the political decisions that they made, they find themselves having created an atmosphere in which even somebody like PERSON is viewed as not sufficiently conservative, or if he does just some of the basic work of governance that somehow he has betrayed the base and is decried as a NORP in name only. And when you have that kind of environment, it is very hard to get the kind of cooperation that is necessary for us to solve problems that people are concerned about and that I am assuming that during the course of your conversations they have raised repeatedly. Let me ask CARDINAL of those concerns. In GPE, we spoke with a woman named PERSON, who said, DATE I was making $MONEY an hour. DATE, she said, I make $MONEY an hour. The problem of stagnant wages, of course, did not start with your presidency, but it has not improved much. Well, we have got some long-term trends that we have to battle, and when I came into office we were in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We have successfully dug ourselves out of that hole. The country has, but wages have not improved for average people ... I am going to answer your question. So we had unemployment at PERCENT. It is now below 5. We had a housing market that had completely collapsed. We had a situation in which people had lost MONEY in wealth in their FAC's and they have recovered it. In fact, NORP have gotten back MONEY of wealth since I came into office. So by every measure, the economy has improved. But the long-term trends that had occurred before I took office and have continued is a combination of globalization and automation, leading to more downward pressure on wages because you need fewer workers to make a certain amount of stuff; and entire job sectors being shrunk or eliminated; more and more people going into the service sector, and in the service sector, historically wages have been lower.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio4", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-4", "publication_date": "27-06-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

This is why we fought for higher minimum wages. This is why, I think, it is so important that as we move forward, if we are going to benefit from all the huge productivity increases and efficiencies that arise out of the global supply chain and automated everything, then we are going to have to redesign that social compact to make sure that everybody is getting a decent wage. It is not as if we need a radical restructuring of the economy. If we had a minimum wage that required everybody to get - be above poverty if they are working full time, that would go a long way towards alleviating some of the trends that we talked about. And in fact, we have seen wage growth now begin to occur over DATE, but it is not happening as fast as it should. There is a writer for ORG, PERSON, who wrote something interesting after GPE voted to leave ORG DATE. He wrote in a column, globalization is not working, that it may make countries richer, but the majority of people are not benefiting. He was writing about GPE, but you mentioned globalization in the context of GPE. I think he is right that what you are seeing across the advanced economies is that when you have globalization and suddenly there is competition from everywhere, that empowers people who have a lot of skills, can use the Internet. Suddenly they have access to all the markets. And what that means is, if you are very good at something, if you are PERSON or you are PERSON or you are ENTITY Jobs, then suddenly you can leverage your skills in ways that you could never do before. If you are a manual worker, and are doing work that can be replaced not just by a lower-wage worker somewhere else but more frequently by a machine, then you are in a tougher spot because you now are competing against the entire world instead of just the people who live around you.

And I think you see that somewhat in the GPE vote. You see some of it in both the PERSON campaign and the PERSON campaign, people feeling as if we are potentially being left behind. Or what is the cure to this whole thing? And the notion is that, from my perspective, we are not going to suddenly eliminate the global supply chain. We are not going to disentangle the world economy. It is just too integrated now by virtue of technology and the Internet. And so what we have to do is to make sure that wages around the world are beginning to rise, that environmental standards around the world are beginning to rise, that within our own countries we are providing the education that people need to compete in this global economy, with new skills for the new industries that are out there, that we invest more in things like infrastructure that make us competitive, and also, by the way, cannot be shipped away. I actually think that, over time, it can raise everybody's living standards and create a more peaceful world. But if you do it in a way where the benefits of globalization are only for the elites who are flying around from capital to capital and looking at their investment portfolios on a laptop or a computer screen, and they are not worrying, they feel disengaged from their national economies and their national workers and their national communities, then you are going to see a reaction to it. PERSON talked about global elites after the vote in GPE. Is PERSON right that there are big parallels between what motivated the NORP vote and what people are feeling and thinking about in the election DATE in GPE?

You have had DATE of stagnation there, partly because of austerity measures that we did not duplicate. The NORP attempted to impose those kinds of strategies here and I resisted them, and I would argue that that is part of the reason why we did a lot better. We reformed our banking system a lot faster. And so overall, I think that the differences are greater than the similarities. But what is absolutely true is that the ability to tap into a fear that people may have about losing control, and to offer some sort of vague, nostalgic feelings about how, you know, we will make GPE great again or we will make GPE great again.

Well, I think that there are some bedrock values that should not change, and in fact, have not changed. The values of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the values of free speech, the values of religious tolerance, the values of pluralism, the values of us being a nation of immigrants that can absorb people from every corner of the world and yet at the end of the day, because we all pledge allegiance to a flag and a creed, we become CARDINAL.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio4", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-4", "publication_date": "27-06-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

When you look at second-generation immigrants, or third-generation immigrants, they are as NORP as any kid here. That is part of what separates us from GPE or Europe, is we have had that tradition of being a nation of immigrants. And so, you know, when people are concerned about some of the changes that immigrants may bring, you know, they need to go back and read what people were saying about their grandparents or great-grandparents when they came. You read about the description of NORP who arrived, and the language that is being used is identical to the language that Mr. PERSON uses about NORP. You know, when NORP were coming instead of NORP, there was absolute certainty that GPE was going down the tubes because these swarthy, you know, folks were coming here and they had different attitudes. And NORP were coming, which meant that the pope was going to control us. And - this kind of xenophobia is part of the NORP tradition, and the good news is that, you know, after these spasms of it, it typically fades away, because the immigrants who come here, in fact, are coming here precisely to embrace the opportunities of being NORP. Is there a danger that GPE, after this Brexit vote, will turn inward, focus increasingly on its own problems and its own turmoil, and be less active in the world? Well, I think that the best way to think about this is a pause button has been pressed on the project of full NORP integration. I would not overstate it. There has been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if, somehow, ORG's gone and the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving and every country is rushing off to its own corner.

There is another passage which I had not even noticed before, in which you say there is a similar anger among some in the white community who do not feel particularly privileged by their race and do feel frustrated that they are losing jobs, losing pensions, feel like they are losing ground. Looking back, were you describing there the same force that is driving much of our election discussion here in DATE? Well, not only the election and discussion driving DATE; this has been an ongoing theme in NORP history. You can go back and during Jim Crow and segregation and you have got black sharecroppers who have nothing and alongside them, poor white farmers who do not have that much more except for the fact that they are white. And the degree to which a lot of politics in the South were specifically designed to make sure that that sharecropper and that white farmer did not get together to question how the economy was structured and how they both could benefit, that is - that is one of the oldest stories in NORP politics. So - so it is not surprising that what I said in DATE still holds true DATE. It was true for DATE. The nature of racial bias in this country is unique and the challenges that NORP have faced are incomparable. NORP in this country, you know, were burdened by extraordinary bias and cruelty, as well. And it is probably not useful to sort of catalog every possible group's grievances. What is true, though, is that as I travel around the country, what a black, working-class person has in common with a white, working-class person is significant. And what prevents them from voting along the same lines or working together on the same projects to do with a whole range of cultural and identity issues which, you know, they obviously feel are important and valid.

Do you believe that? Keep in mind -- if you are a NORP -- and we have heard some NORP make this argument -- some of those who are leading the charge on this make this argument -- and essentially, what they are saying is, once this is fully implemented and CARDINAL of people who currently do not have health care have health care at reasonable prices and protections are in place for consumers across the board, that it will be sufficiently successful and popular that people will not want to repeal it.

It does not add to the deficit. If the assumptions in current law held. Well -- but the assumptions so far not only have held, they have actually exceed expectations. Health care costs have gone up slower since we passed the Affordable Care Act. There were great predictions coming from the NORP that health care costs would go up even faster; that has not happened. There were predictions that the market places that we are setting up -- essentially, the group plans where people buy health insurance -- would not offer a good deal to consumers.

At that point, any president -- not just me -- any president is subject to that kind of blackmail continuously.

Raising the debt ceiling is not raising the debt, it is simply saying ORG is authorizing the ORG to pay for those things that ORG has already approved. So a potential debt-ceiling crisis approaches, even as the president tries to manage ordinary business. He had hoped to name a new ORG chairman by now, giving ORG time to act DATE to find a successor to PERSON. As he pondered that decision, I asked if the president wants the next ORG chair to change course for the ORG. He began by noting that the ORG is a dual mandate, CARDINAL part is protecting the currency. Part of that mandate is also full employment, making sure that the economy is growing in such a way that people have the chance to succeed. Should the ORG be doing more in that department? Well, I think that the ORG has to constantly monitor where the economy is moving, but we cannot put the entire burden on the ORG. And this brings us back to the original point about potential government shutdowns or potential default because we are not paying our bills. The -- we have dug ourselves out of a deep hole, and the economy now has grown. We have created jobs for DATE. We have created CARDINAL new jobs.

There have been other commissions that have been put forward over DATE. And I am going to have to put a budget out that shows how I think we make some -- a serious dent in our debt and our deficit. I think every economist -- and by the way, the commissions who looked at this as well -- realize that because we have got a recovery that is still not as strong as we'd like it to be. The vast majority of economists, as well as both the chairman of ORG, as well as other commissions, have suggested that because the recovery is just taking off and is still not producing as many jobs as it needs to, that it actually makes sense for us not do anything that contracts the economy right now because the single most important thing we can do for deficit reduction is actually expand economic growth. PERCENT of additional economic growth brings in a whole lot of revenue even with no changes in the tax code. And so the payroll tax provision that is included in this package is going to help spark economic growth that will help. Now, it does not solve our medium- and long-term problems, so we are going to still have to make some very tough decisions -- and these too are going to be unpopular.

The problem is, how are we dealing with our medium-term debt and deficit, and how are we dealing with our long- term debt and deficit?

This -- this is not a situation where we have got to slash and burn everything. It does mean we have got to make choices.

We -- we are not going to be able to deal with our deficit just by eliminating foreign aid, for example, which some people suggest. That only accounts for PERCENT of our budget.

That is the kind of plan you are talking about. Well, I have not specifically endorsed that plan.

We have seen some success in the NORP opposition gaining more capacity, gaining more training, gaining more effectiveness; and building on some of that success, it is conceivable that in combination with the other work that is done on the diplomatic front, that we are able to tip what happens in GPE so that it is more likely that we can arrive at a political resolution.

You know, those are a lot of markets out there, we sell a lot of goods out there, and, you know, we do not want to see these conflagrations that can end up impeding, you know, our own interests. Sounds like you want to avoid tripwire over any particular rock in the ocean, as you said. Well, you know, I think, more than that, what we also want is to be able to strengthen and constantly reinforce international norms because we believe, I believe, that GPE benefits when those norms are not only being upheld by us individually but where all countries buy in, where there is a sense that all of us benefit from some basic rules of the road. And GPE now as a rising power needs to be part of that responsibility of maintaining rules that maintain peace and security for a lot of countries. You have made some statements recently, ENTITY, that it seems you have been trying to put yourself in a historical context, if you can. You have talked about hitting singles and doubles on foreign policy. You talked about handing a baton from CARDINAL ENTITY or CARDINAL person in history to another. I wonder if you are at a point in your second term where even though there is DATE to go, that you have to think about narrowing possibilities and a more limited list of things that you can realistically accomplish in the time you have left. That was the case DATE in FAC. You know, you do not walk into the presidency and completely remake the world and ignore history and ignore the problems that are already sitting there in the inbox.

And every once in a while, a pitch is going to come right over home plate that you can knock out for a home run. But you do not swing at every pitch. And we have opportunities right now, for example, and I talked about DATE, to advance an NORP agreement on their nuclear program that could be historic. We may not get it, but there is a chance that it could still happen. I have not yet given up on the possibility that both NORP and NORP can see their self-interest in a peace deal that would provide GPE security that is recognized by its neighbors and make sure that NORP have a state of their own. And what we want to do is make sure we are in a position to seize those opportunities when they arise. But in the meantime, the work that we do to help countries in North Africa secure their borders and root out terrorism, the work that we do to, you know, make sure that we have higher standards for labor protection and environmental protection when it comes to trade in Asia, the work that we do in making sure that young people in Latin America are coming to GPE to study through exchange programs so that - and that GPE students are able to go to those countries to develop the commercial ties and cultural ties in the Western Hemisphere, you know, that stuff's not sexy. It is not going to be on the front page of the newspapers. But in many ways, that is what is going to ultimately be most effective; that is going to be what is going to most determine whether or not GPE retains its primacy and its leadership on the world stage in DATE.

I think it is very important as we end the war that originally gave - gave life to FAC that we now wind it down. Could you not send more prisoners back now? Well, the - you know, ORG has placed some restraints on us. But they have loosened those restraints. And I promise you that we are using every possible available avenue. In some cases, it is hard to return prisoners because the countries where they come from do not want them or cannot provide us assurances that they can control them. But what I know is that we cannot in good conscience maintain a system of indefinite detention in which individuals who have not been tried and convicted are held permanently in this legal limbo outside of this country. That is contrary to GPE traditions. It feeds terrorist propaganda. It is not ultimately going to be effective when it comes to dealing with the long-term terrorist threat. It makes it harder for us to get cooperation from our partners. I mean, we spend CARDINAL CARDINAL times more, in many cases, for these prisoners than we would do in a normal supermax syst - prison in our federal system. So for all kinds of reasons, it does not make sense. And I am going to keep on pushing because I want to make sure that when I turn the keys over to the next president, that they have the ability, that he or she has the capacity to - to make some decisions with a relatively clean slate. Making sure that we have the right legal architecture for how we conduct counterterrorism and that there is greater transparency, as I discussed DATE, that is another.

Well, ENTITY, I have got to tell you, if -- if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in, in order to prop up your only ally is leadership, then we have got a different definition of leadership. My definition of leadership would be leading on climate change, an international accord that potentially we will get in GPE. My definition of leadership is mobilizing the entire world community to make sure that GPE does not get a nuclear weapon.

I thought it was important, though, for us to be able to say that we'd definitely got the guy. We thought that it was important for us to be able to exploit potential information that was on the ground in the compound if it did turn out to be him. We thought that it was important for us not only to protect the lives of our guys, but also to try to minimize collateral damage in the region because this was in a residential neighborhood. I mean one of the ironies of this is, you know, I think the image that PERSON had tried to promote was that he was an ascetic, living in a cave. This guy was living in a MONEY compound in a residential neighborhood. Were you surprised when they came to you with this compound right in the middle of sort of the military center of GPE? Well, I think that there had been discussions that this guy might be hiding in plain sight. And we knew that some ORG operatives, high level targets basically, just blended into the crowd like this. I think we were surprised when we learned that this compound had been there for DATE, and that it was in an area in which you would think that potentially he would attract some attention. So yes, the answer is that we were surprised that he could maintain a compound like that for that long without there being a tip off. Do you believe it was built for him? We are still investigating that, but what is clear is that the elements of the compound were structured so that nobody could see in. There were no sight lines that would enable somebody walking by or somebody in an adjoining building to see him. So it was clearly designed to make sure that PERSON was protected from public view. Do you have any idea how long he was there? Did he move out of that compound? That we do not know yet. But we know that for DATE this compound was there, and our belief is that he was there during that time. What was the most difficult part of that decision?

And they do not know what they are gonna find there. They do not know if, you know, there are explosives that are triggered by a particular door opening. So huge risks that these guys are taking. if I send them in, can I get them out? And a lot of the discussion we had during the course of planning was how do we make sure there is backup? How do we make sure that there is redundancy built into the plan so that we have the best chance of getting our guys out? as outstanding a job as our intelligence teams did -- and I cannot praise them enough they did an extraordinary job with just the slenderest of bits of information to piece this all together -- at the end of the day, this was still a CARDINAL situation.

The fact that our ORG have become so good -- these guys perform at levels that DATE would not have happened -- I think finally gave me the confidence to say, Let us go ahead. I think that the NORP people have some sense of how good these guys are, but until you actually see 'em and meet them, it is hard to describe how courageous, how tough, how skilled, how precise they are. And it was because of their skills that I ended up having confidence to make the decision. I mean it is been reported that there was some resistance from advisors and planners who disagreed with the commando raid approach. Was it difficult for you to overcome that?

You know, we understood that there were some significant risks involved in this. How much did some of the past failures, like the GPE hostage rescue attempt, how did that weigh on you?

Did you tell PERSON? You know one of the great successes of this operation was that we were able to keep this thing secret. And it is a testimony to how seriously everybody took this operation and the understanding that any leak could end up not only compromising the mission, but killing some of the guys that we were sending in there.

We had to blow up some walls. When was the first indication you got that you had found the right place? There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said PERSON has been killed. And PERSON was the code name for PERSON. And now obviously at that point these guys were operating in the dark with all kinds of stuff going on so everybody was cautious.

You know, we discussed this internally. Keep in mind that we are absolutely certain this was him. We have done DNA sampling and testing. And so there is no doubt that we killed PERSON. It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence.

We thought it was important to think through ahead of time how we would dispose of the body if he were killed in the compound. And I think that what we tried to do was, consulting with experts in NORP law and ritual, to find something that was appropriate that was respectful of the body. Frankly we took more care on this than, obviously, PERSON took when he killed CARDINAL people. He did not have much regard for how they were treated and desecrated.

You know, I have gotta be careful about sources and methods and how we operate and how we pieced together this intelligence, because we are gonna still be going after terrorists in the future. What I can say is that GPE, since 9/11, has been a strong counterterrorism partner with us. There have been times where we have had disagreements. There have been times where we wanted to push harder, and for various concerns, they might have hesitated. But the fact of the matter is, is that we have been able to kill more terrorists on NORP soil than just about any place else. We could not have done that without NORP cooperation. And I think that this will be an important moment in which GPE and GPE gets together and says, All right, we have gotten PERSON, but we have got more work to do.

It does not mean that there are not gonna be times where we are gonna be frustrated with NORP. And frankly, there are gonna be times where they are frustrated with us. You know, they have got not only individual terrorists there, but there is also a climate inside of GPE that sometimes is deeply NORP. But I do think that it is important for the NORP people to understand that we have got a stake in continuing cooperation from GPE on these issues. You did not tell anybody in the NORP government or the military. As I said, I did not tell most people here in FAC. I did not tell my own family.

I think that the way to think about it is the dangers of a second Big Recession are now much reduced; the danger of us tipping into a Great Depression, I think most economists would say, is not -- is not out there on the horizon.

So, if we are willing to make investments in education so that everybody gets a fair chance and kids are not coming out with $MONEY worth of debt to go to college. If we make sure that everybody's doing their fair share, to pay for things like infrastructure improvements in basic science and research and advanced manufacturing and innovation, we ask those who've benefited the most over DATE, we ask them to do a little bit more.

The deductions mean things that a lot of people of modest means rely on.

I can tell you, just from QUANTITY, that some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street, in some cases, some of the least ethical behavior on Wall Street, was not illegal.

You know, there are a whole range of benefits that have helped to build companies, create value, create profits. For you to continue to benefit from that entire architecture that helps you thrive, but move your technical address simply to avoid paying taxes, is neither fair nor is it something that is going to be good for the country over the long term. And this is basically taking advantage of tax provisions that are technically legal , but I think most people would say if you are doing business here, if you are basically still an NORP company, but you are simply changing your mailing address in order to avoid paying taxes, then you are really not doing right by the country and by the NORP people. Some people would respond that, you know what, these guys are hired to maximize profit. And they are doing basically what they were hired to do. And in fact, it is plenty NORP for them to try to make as much profit as they can, hire as many people as they can as a result. Well, keep in mind that what we are trying to do is to say that if you simply acquire a small company in GPE or some other country to take advantage of the low tax rate, you start saying we are now magically an NORP company, despite the fact that you may only have CARDINAL employees there And you have got CARDINAL employees in GPE. You are just gaming the system. You continue to benefit in all kinds a ways from being an NORP company. It is true that, you know, there are a lot of things that may be legal that probably are not the right thing to do by the country. People are paid to maximize profits.

Your critics suggest that you have not put the presidential muscle behind this issue, certainly the way you did health care or the way you did stimulus early on in your presidency. Well, we reached out repeatedly to both NORP and NORP. If we lower corporate tax rates and close loopholes, there is going to be more certainty in terms of what corporations pay. They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance. It would allow us potentially to have companies who have profits overseas to start bringing some of those profits back and reinvesting in GPE. So there is a whole bunch of good reasons why we should do it. I will be honest with you ENTITY. And they have trouble getting stuff done right now even when they say they want to do something.

Well, let us move from talking about the guys in the C suites to average NORP here. What will you tell average NORP viewer about the outlook for the economy? Your former economic advisor, PERSON says we may be in for a period here in GPE of lower growth for a protracted period of time. Do you believe in that forecast?

And if we close some of those loopholes, not just carried interest but a range that we know are not economically productive, then sure, some folks do not get to take advantage of stuff they should've been taking advantage of anyway. But that also means we can finance government, keep our deficits under control, and invest in the things that we need to grow over the long term. There is no doubt that the economies of GPE and Europe have intertwined, primarily around the energy sector. And it makes some NORP more concerned about a robust response to the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity that GPE's been conducting when it comes to GPE. The good news is that, despite some of those commercial concerns, we have seen Europe move with us - not always as fast as we'd like, but they get there. And sadly, tragically, the shooting down of this ORG airliner and the recognition that it is likely it was shot down and it is also likely that it was conducted by non-state actors that were provided incredibly powerful weapons by the NORP government - all that, I think, may stiffen the spine of my NORP partners moving forward. I want to ask you about GPE. What do you make of these - the ORG banning these flights and then lifting it? Do you think it is safe for NORP to fly to GPE? You know, we have not made decisions when it comes to airline safety based on not just politics, but even our strong alliance with GPE. We have to just look at the facts.

In his statement of saying there is a great tradition of Presidential warnings as they leave FAC. I have not really viewed the farewell address in terms of Presidential warnings, but I can-it makes sense to say, I have learned this, and I wish my successor all the best, and GPE needs to be on the lookout. CARDINAL option for me is to talk about isolationism and protectionism, and that it is very important for us to resist those isms. The world needs our presence. The people dying of ENTITY on the continent of Africa need a robust response by GPE to save lives. We need voices calling upon coalition members to stay in the fight against the terrorists. And protectionism is rearing its ugly head; witness the fact that we had trouble getting good free trade agreements through the ORG with GPE and GPE and GPE. And so maybe that is what I will warn about as well. How should we use former Presidents? How do you want to be used, in what capacity, as you leave this office? CARDINAL thing I do not want to do is stay on the stage. The spotlight needs to shift to President-elect PERSON, and it needs to stay on President-elect PERSON, because he is the President. And therefore, I will not try to get it to shift to me. And I will be very respectful of him during his Presidency. I think each President is going to have to chart his own way. I am going to build a policy institute at ORG to talk about, for example, the isms -isolationism and protectionism, and the need to resist them-or the transformative power of freedom.

No, because I do not believe- it might help some individual NORP get reelected to ORG if they voted for such an agreement, but I believe that for NORP what is good policy is almost always the best politics.

CARDINAL last question on ORG, before we turn to new markets. Senator PERSON was critical, saying your plan did not go far enough by addressing structural reforms. And you, yourself, since Putting People First, have supported things like means testing. Are you frustrated that politically it was not possible to go farther than you went in this ORG plan? No, I think-well, first of all, I think the structural reforms in the health care-there are CARDINAL issues there. CARDINAL is the means testing, which was not in his report, either, because some of the NORP did not go for it. I do not think that is as big a problem as some people do, and I will come back to that. The second is an area on which we have an honest disagreement-PERSON and PERSON and me-and it is an honest disagreement.

And we just have an honest, philosophical difference about that. Now, on the upper income premium issue- I ran on that in DATE. I have never made any secret to the NORP people that I think that is the right thing to do. We took the income limit off of the ORG tax in the DATE balanced budget act. So every wealthy person in GPE DATE is paying much more in ORG taxes than they will use anyway. In other words, if you are making CARDINAL of a million dollars a year, you do not have that $MONEY-I think it was $MONEY cap, something like that-you do not have that cap anymore. So since DATE, you have been paying a great deal into the ORG program. So you do not have the equity argument you used to have. CARDINAL of the reasons that ORG program was extended in its life-apart from the cost savings we effected and waste, fraud, and abuse stuff, which we really did better about than most of us thought we could-is that we took the earnings limitation off the ORG tax, and I think that a lot of times people who say upper income people should pay more have forgotten that and forgotten just what a significant amount of money that is to a lot of people. We better turn to new markets, because we want to talk a little about that, too. So you are going DATE from Appalachia to GPE. Tell us why you are doing the tour.

So we do not have any signs of inflation, but should not they be worried about it, since nobody really thought we could have it? Everyone knows that the technology explosion, especially in telecommunications and information technology, has dramatically increased productivity in ways that traditional economic models do not measure. Is there any way we could keep this economic recovery going, creating even more jobs, raising incomes even more, and not have inflation? And the answer is, yes, if you can either find more customers for NORP goods and services or more workers to come in and produce more so they are not just being added on for the same level of production. Now, what are the possibilities for that? Expanded trade, which is why I have worked very hard to build a consensus in my own party for trade, plus labor and environmental standards- why I went to GPE and made those speeches, why I went to ORG and all that-for trade. The most obvious ones in GPE are more people from welfare to work. TIME I had PERSON at the fundraiser, if you listened in on that. He is now got CARDINAL companies in this deal where we are trying to hire even hard-to-place welfare recipients and train them. Because that is adding to the productive capacity. You get people who are both workers and consumers. The other big discrete population are the disabled, which is why this thing that apparently we are going to have an overwhelming bipartisan majority of ORG do, which is to let disabled people keep their ORG in the work force, it is potentially a very big, positive contribution to long-term growth, because, again, you are creating more workers and more consumers.

We really pushed it. So we will do a little of that, hear things that are working now. The second thing I want to do is to point out that CARDINAL of the reasons there has not been more investment in these areas is that there is imperfect knowledge on the part of the NORP business and investment community. The head of ORG insurance company, when we went to GPE, when we did our pre-trip-on the way back he was ragging me. He said, You know, I am the only guy here who is not happy we did this, because, he said, I'd already figured all this out by myself, and now all my competitors are going to know. I will just give you CARDINAL example. In GPE it is PERCENT. In GPE, where we are going, it is PERCENT. That is just retail sales, no small-scale manufacturing, no professional services, none of that other stuff, all the other things you could do. So I think there is really a lot I can do just with the bully pulpit and taking these business leaders around and getting them-you know, we are going to have bipartisan political folks there; we have got PERSON and PERSON; we are going to have NORP and NORP Congressmen and Governors and all. But I think that just getting the business community to focus on the fact-because they are all interested in this question, what I want to say to them is, look, you do not just have to debate what PERSON is going to do; you can change the underlying reality on the ground if you change the economics. And the third thing that I want to do is to push the specific new markets legislation.

This new markets initiative basically is designed to put in place for the whole ORG, all distressed areas the same incentives that we give GPE to invest in developing economies overseas. I think they ought to have those incentives, developing economies at home. So, for example, the way this would work is let us suppose someone wanted to build a MONEY shopping center in GPE and open CARDINAL stores-I am just making this up-and they started with MONEY of investments; they have got a MONEY investment fund. On that MONEY they could get tax credits of PERCENT for their investment. They would also be able to go to the bank and borrow MONEY and have that MONEY subject to the Government guarantee, which would dramatically lower the interest rate that they would be charged to borrow the money, because if they defaulted on the loan, the ORG would guarantee it. And those are the kinds of mechanisms we have in place now for people who invest in developing markets overseas. The reason that is important is, number CARDINAL, unlike the empowerment zones, it would be nationwide, and number CARDINAL, even if you had perfect knowledge on the part of investors, that you do not have now, there would be, in many of these places, somewhat greater risk to the investment than in a traditional investment. So by providing these CARDINAL big incentives you lower the relative risk of this investment compared to others and make it even more attractive to do. But if you think about it, this is sort of my classic Third Way kind of approach. In DATE's, we found out for sure that free enterprise alone would not develop these areas into DATE. In DATE's, with the whole Great Society approach, it is not true that it did not accomplish anything. It accomplished a great deal. It fed people; it educated people; it started ORG; it provided health care in rural areas; it provided some Government-funded jobs.

But it seems to me that there is an enormous interest in this now, in the business community. You can see it in ORG that PERSON and PERSON and others have done for DATE, and you can see it in the massive commitment that-and ORG made to setting up community banks and microenterprise lending over DATE. They made a huge commitment on their own. A lot of great things have happened in our empowerment zones. A lot of these development banks are beginning to really show some results. But there is no either nationwide awareness or nationwide framework which could be applied to every place. And that is what the new markets initiative is all about. It is about just increasing the awareness and the attractiveness of these areas to the investment community and then putting in place a framework that would make it even more attractive to invest DATE. And if we could get a lot of this done while the economy is growing, I think the benefits to GPE could be permanent. I think, in that sense, it is the perfect public/private partnership example that I have been trying to develop all along. I am really excited about it. I am just-it is a real dream of mine to prove this can be done. You will apparently be the first sitting ENTITY to ever go to an NORP reservation.

And there is a level of security about the direction of our economy that I think frees people in a way to think about those things that are still not done, because I think most NORP genuinely want to see everybody who is willing to work have a chance to participate in this. Secondly, I believe that it is an essential component of my effort to keep this economy growing without inflation, as I said. In other words, I think moving people from welfare to work is a moral imperative, but I also think it is very good for the economy. I think giving disabled people a chance to take their ORG and get in the work force is morally right; I also think it is very good for the economy, and I think this could be even better for the economy, and it is certainly morally right.

And just slowly, slowly, slowly over DATE, I think we have completely satisfied that a lot of these communities, if they can get enough investment, can really take off and do well.

They want to win; they have got more money than we do anyway. So I think that it is a credit to-he is got good people raising that money, obviously, but I am not at all surprised they have raised that kind of money.

I am following around one of your newest-well, not your newest rivals but CARDINAL of the newest candidates for President on the NORP side, PERSON. So let me begin by asking you about your speech on DATE concerning the 50th anniversary of ORG. How do you plan to outline ways for the ORG to reconstitute itself for DATE? Well, I think we have to, first of all, recognize that-I think there are CARDINAL fundamental realities we have to recognize. Number CARDINAL is that the end of the cold war gives the ORG the possibility of living up to the dreams of its founders in ways that were simply impossible when the world was divided into CARDINAL large blocs. And so I think there should be a lot of hope about the ORG The second thing I think we have to recognize is that in order for that hope to be realized, the ORG has got to be properly run and, in particular, the peacekeeping operations have to be properly run. And GPE has spent a lot of time, because we pay a lot of the costs of the ORG, analyzing how the overall operations can be more efficient and cost-effective and inspire more confidence in the countries that are paying the bills and, in particular, looking at the peacekeeping operations and setting up systems to make sure that we use peacekeeping when it will work, that we restrain it when the situation is not right, and that the command-and-control operations are absolutely clear, that we do not have any kind of mixed signals and crossed lines that have sometimes happened in the past. And then when you look ahead into the future, I think it is clear that the new problems of DATE are likely to be rooted in ethnic, religious, and other internal problems within countries and across borders; dealing with or helping to avoid natural disasters that are brought on by a combination of population explosion and natural problems like the inability to produce food; and the rise of terrorism and the danger of proliferation of biological, chemical, and small-scale nuclear weapons.

But the last ORG was far more focused on getting the ORG to work right, not having GPE walk away from its responsibilities and became more isolationist. But I will also say back to my fellow NORP and to the ORG that we should continue to support ORG, that they do a lot of work in the world that GPE might have to do alone or might eventually be pulled into doing, because they keep problems from becoming as bad as they would otherwise be.

And for all the frustration people in our country have with the problems in GPE, the casualty rates have gone way, way down since the ORG forces went on the ground there and since GPE began to support them with massive humanitarian airlifts and with our operation to keep the war from going into the air. That is what Captain PERSON was doing when he was shot down; he was enforcing the no-fly zone. And I think it is important never to forget that. Before ORG became involved and before we became as aggressive as we were in trying to provide air help, in DATE, there were CARDINAL people killed in that civil war. In DATE, the death rate was down to CARDINAL. So I think that it is important, even in GPE, to keep this in perspective. ORG did not succeed in ending the war in GPE. ORG did not go in there to militarily defeat the NORP, and they are not capable of doing that, and that was never what they were established- that is not what they were sent there to do.

{"id": 2327, "text": "I mean, here GPE is, the world's only superpower militarily, with other countries becoming increasingly wealthy, where there are other countries willing to put their troops on the ground in their own trouble spots and not asking us to do it, like GPE, and willing to pay an increasingly large share of running ORG. And now we have people in our country and, most importantly, people in our ORG, who want to walk away from our global responsibilities and walk away from the opportunity to cooperate with people in ways that permit others to carry some share of the load. You know, sometimes I get the feeling that some of the critics of our cooperation with other countries want it both ways. They want to be able to run the world and tell everybody exactly how to behave, and then not have to cooperate with anybody when they have a slight difference of opinion from us or even if they are willing to put their troops on the ground and put their money up. That is the case in GPE, where the NORP said, We will take the lead. We will put our troops on the ground. This will be paid for through ORG, so you will not have to pay for any more than your regular assessment. We ask you for your air power and the support of the ORG, but we are going to follow the prescribed ORG policy. We are not going to let the GPE dictate policy, especially when it is our troops and our lives that are at risk. And I think we cannot have it both ways. We cannot become an isolationist country, and we cannot dictate every other country's course. And it is better for us to be a leader within the framework of ORG, which means that from time to time we will have to cooperate with people and agree on a policy that may reflect more of a consensus than our absolute best desires. But that is what ORG was set up to do. The GPE is still clearly the dominant country in ORG. We still are able to do the things we need to do to be-for example, to keep a firm hand with GPE; we have been able to keep other countries from lifting the sanctions off GPE; we have been able to get a tougher line-in many ways, we were able to have our policy in GPE prevail.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And so in your speech on DATE, despite the criticism of the GPE involvement in the ORG, you will not be backing away from the ORG, but at the same time, you will also be offering suggestions for reforming it? But I do intend to say that this is going to be a DATE organization, that it is more than a debating forum and-that involves a collective decision by the community of free nations to deploy people all across the world, not just in military situations, like peacekeeping, but in other ways, where it is going to have to be run very well and it is going to have to be able to inspire the confidence of taxpaying citizens not only in GPE but throughout the world. But I think-I still think the fundamental fact is that the end of the cold war permits the ORG to live up to its full potential; that we ought to become-we ought to stay involved, we ought to pay our fair share, and we ought to be very grateful that there are other countries that are willing to spend their money and actually put their people at risk in places where either we would not do it or we do not now have to do it all, we do not have to carry the whole load; and that we ought to be willing to lead in an atmosphere in which we also have to cooperate from time to time, especially when others are making a greater sacrifice and when the problem's in their backyard. And that is- that is the sort of future we ought to want. And we also ought to be mature enough to recognize that as long as human beings are alive on the Earth, bad things will happen, problems will exist, and that there will never be a complete and easy solution to all the problems in the world. But far better this course into the future than either having the nuclear cloud hang over the world, as it did in the cold war, or having the GPE become an isolationist power, as we did between the wars, and run the risk of other terrible things happening all around the world which would drag us back into another war in the future.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

But it is far better than the alternative, better than what we went through in the cold war and better than having an NORP isolationism. Sir, CARDINAL question away from the ORG, and that is the subject of military bases. CARDINAL of your political allies, Senator PERSON, has asked you to consider sparing some of the bases in GPE slated to be closed. At the same time, CARDINAL of your political opponents, PERSON, plans to attack the administration in a speech TIME in GPE for what he says are artificially low target levels that ORG has given ORG, which has resulted in a need to close more military bases than necessary to meet the budget targets. I am wondering first, on the political ally side, if there is any chance that you would spare any of the bases in GPE, and on the political opponent side, what you would say to that criticism by Governor PERSON? Well, first of all, let us deal with the base issue. The way the base closings works is-the way the base closing process works is that the commission votes on which bases to close. Then they send it to me in a package, which they will do on DATE. I can accept it, in which case it goes to ORG, and unless ORG rejects it, it goes into law; the second option is I can reject it out of hand, in which case there are no base closings; the third option is that I can send it back to the commission with recommended changes. And I have to tell you that with regard to GPE, as you know, FAC was not on our list. And it was not on our list, basically-it was not on the ORG list for CARDINAL reasons, both of which I thought were good reasons. CARDINAL was that GPE had PERCENT of the defense investment for the country, but it sustained PERCENT of the base cuts in the first CARDINAL rounds. The other is that the ORG thought that a better way to deal with the problem of over-capacity in what is done at FAC and down at FAC in GPE was to shave some of the capacity off CARDINAL of the sites around the country and presented a plan to do that.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Now secondly, Governor PERSON is just wrong about what he said about defense. Basically, my defense numbers have been about the same as the NORP of ORG have recommended and what the ORG has asked for. And the truth is that the ENTITY people-all the military people but particularly the ENTITY-will tell you that we have brought the force structure down, we have reduced defense in real dollar terms PERCENT since DATE and we have reduced the size of the military by PERCENT, and we have reduced our base structure, oh, CARDINAL that, considerably less than half that. So most of the military experts will tell you that the reduction of base structure in GPE and throughout the world has lagged far behind the reduction in numbers of people in the military. And I have tried to be very sensitive since I have been in office to the economic impact of this, to trying to give these bases a chance to do alternative things like help to develop a civilian mission as well as a military mission, and a lot of that work is being done at FAC and in some other places as well in GPE and throughout the country. But it is just not true to say that inadequate budgets have led to the closing of more bases than were necessary. We have, in fact, tried to keep more open than the strict, harsh numbers would dictate, given how much the size of our forces have been reduced. I am sure it is good politics for him to say that in GPE or wherever else, but it is simply not true. I was just going to ask the ORG if Governor PERSON really is the candidate he fears most and if there is any chance that PERSON will or may not open? Well, first of all, let me just say those CARDINAL questions are totally independent of one another. From the day I became ENTITY I worked hard to help GPE, and I think the people of GPE know that. We have given aid because of the earthquakes and the fires on more generous terms than had previously been the case.

But this is something that is worrying Wall Street because you saw the reaction to the employment report that the worry is that as wages rise, that this could create inflation. Do you think that wages are rising so fast that you could create an inflation problem? I do not think there is any evidence of that now for a couple of reasons. CARDINAL is, you know, we had DATE when, in effect, there was no real rise in wages for people in the middle and the lower income groups, and they have had a good rise. It is been going on for DATE now. But we have seen enough experience, at least so far, that we do not see the signs of inflation. I also believe the fact that we have open markets and, therefore, lots of competition and a lot of productivity increases fueled by technology should give us some encouragement there. But based on the present evidence, I think people are-they are earning their pay increases, and they have worked hard for them, and so far, I do not think there is evidence of inflation.

No, I do not , because, keep in mind, the stock market was CARDINAL when I took office. It was CARDINAL in DATE, late in DATE. You are just not going to have that DATE. But I think that the most important thing I can say is that from my point of view, is that, as Secretary PERSON used to say, Markets go up. What the Government should focus on is keeping the fundamentals right. And it seems to me that if we can keep paying down the debt, practice fiscal responsibility, keep pushing to open markets, and keep making the kind of long-term investments that we know are good for the NORP economy, then the people in the private sector will take care of the rest.

Now, that does not mean that the laws of economics have been repealed; it must mean that our ability to predict is not as great as it would have been in a more stable time. So I am basically quite optimistic about the NORP economy as long as we keep the fundamentals right. You mentioned PERSON, and there are some people who believe that since PERSON left his post as ORG Secretary, that the administration has modified its policy on the dollar. Can you clarify this for us? And we have seen the dollar under pressure recently. Do you no longer support a strong dollar policy? No, we have not modified our policy. I think that what you have seen with the dollar is partly a function of an expected recovery in Asia, and I think that on balance, that is good. And the NORP economy may be growing a little more; on balance, that is good. Plus, you know, to try to help our friends in Asia and GPE get through this crisis-and the NORP particularly have had-even they have had a little bit of problems-we have run quite a large trade deficit here because we have not wanted to close our markets since they were in trouble. Those things happen-that tends to weaken the currency too, after a certain amount of time. So I have not been particularly alarmed by it, but neither am I for a weak dollar. I think GPE has to be for a strong dollar. And again, I say the way for us to do that is to not abandon our budgetary discipline and our long-term policies on expanded trade and investments and technology. ENTITY, let us talk a little bit about taxes. You have been quite adamant, and so has your administration, that any kind of tax cut MONEY is no deal. And yet now we are hearing that you may be open to discussion and some negotiation on this. What I am flexible about is what is in the tax cut. It is interesting-if you look at my tax bill of MONEY and the NORP with MONEY, we have almost exactly the same benefits for middle class people, they are just differently configured.

I think it is wrong, on principle, to pass a tax cut before you figure out what your obligations are. And Senator PERSON and Mr. PERSON had this ORG condition. I thought there were some good things in it; there were some things I did not agree with. So I gave ORG a ORG plan that would lengthen the life of ORG and pay for a modest prescription drug benefit. I also gave them a budget which would, over time, not only save the ORG surplus taxes for ORG but would lengthen the life of ORG. And I gave them a budget which said, here is what I would spend for defense, for education, for other things, and here is what I would spend for a tax cut. What I think they ought to do is give me a ORG proposal. Then let us get together and work out what we are going to do with that. Then let us figure out what we have to spend. Already this ORG, even under the NORP leadership, has decided to spend more for veterans, for agriculture, and for defense. And they say they want to spend more for education. But their tax cut makes it clear, specifically in the tax bill, that they had to cut all these things drastically that they are voting to spend more money on. So my position is, send me a ORG proposal; let us figure out what we have to spend on other things and what we have got to do to pay the debt down, and let us give the rest back to the taxpayers. And I will be very flexible about how we do it. We had PERSON, chairman of ORG, on our program recently, and he was saying that when you look at the whole surplus, CARDINAL of it would be devoted to these tax cut proposals, things like an income tax cut, estate tax cut, cut in the marriage penalty tax. And even your Vice President, Mr. PERSON, was on our program recently-he said he would support a cut in the marriage penalty tax.

{"id": 2334, "text": "But the question is- let me just say, in all respect to Senator PERSON, they say it that way because it sounds so reasonable, but that is not quite right, and here is why. The NORP have agreed with me- and I applaud them for this-they have agreed that we should take that portion of the surplus- projected surplus-it is not here yet-that portion of projected surplus attributable to ORG taxes and not spend it. That leaves a third left. When you take their tax cut, plus the extra interest payments we have to make-because when you cut taxes, you do not pay the debt off as fast-it takes up everything that is left, which means that they have no money to spend whatever on defense, on education, on lengthening the life of ORG, and yet they are voting to do these things. So they either want to get into the ORG surplus, at which case we are not going to pay the debt down and we are going to make a big mistake, I think, or they are pursuing the course which will require drastic cuts in the very things they say they are trying to increase. So, on any specific, I am happy to talk to them. I think it would be great to get rid of the marriage penalty. There are a lot of things that they proposed that-in the ORG bill, in the original ORG bill, had a lot of great policy in it. We cannot afford to do that and take care of the NORP economy. Sir, we are running out of time, so I want to ask you a few more quick questions, okay? ENTITY, I would not be a good business reporter unless I asked you a question about PERSON. The last time this came up you said you do not even know if Mr. PERSON would be interested in another term as Chairman of ORG. Now, I am sure you have a lot of contact with Mr. PERSON, and your ORG Secretary meets with him from time to time.

But I think the important thing is for the NORP people to know that I support the direction he is taken, and I think he is done a good job. Since you brought him up, though, I think I ought to mention that he, along with others, have pointed out that if we do not pay the debt down and we still have a tax cut that is too big, it will increase the chances of inflation, which will increase the likelihood of interest rate increases. And all the benefits the NORP people could get in a tax cut, including upper income people, could be taken away by higher interest rates, which not only take more money out of people's pockets directly but will slow economic growth. So I think that that is another thing that ought to be hammered home about this tax cut. Why should we do something on the CARDINAL hand if we are going to lose the benefit of it from higher interest rates and lower growth? I do not want to tackle with you on that, but I do want to talk to you more about economic growth. I'd like to talk to you about your new markets initiatives.

I am investigating it now to see whether I ought to approve it or leave it disapproved. The tax measure I would say was the most important piece of legislation.

And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the ORG. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to ORG. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through DATE in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by ORG, a considerable step in advance. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in DATE as a result of conferences between the Secretary of ORG and ORG that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. I spoke of the CARDINAL treaties. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this ORG. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that did not have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the ORG act upon I secured favorable action. I happened to express it in that way.

That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions.

And I have another thought. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at GPE as the real makers of war and of peace. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house.

That is CARDINAL reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold.

In DATE, GPE, under NORP leadership, has faced up to the poverty and discrimination in its midst. It has not yet mastered them.

That was a hospital located in one of the most beautiful areas of southern GPE, on the tip of the San Fernando Valley. It no longer, of course, can be used, and it should not be rebuilt.

Here we have a policy which, in our Administration, we are implementing on a broad scale across the country. ORG, for example, owns PERCENT of all the land in GPE. We own land all over this country that ORG does not need, land that could be better used by the GPE, by the counties, by the people of this country. So, under these circumstances, with regard to QUANTITY in the San Fernando Valley, we are declaring it surplus through the cooperation of ORG, so that it can be made into a park, a park which will be available to the people in that area and all the people of southern GPE.

But I also know, and you know, that while CARDINAL of NORP are fortunate enough to be able to afford the time and the money to go to one of those great parks located mostly in the western part of GPE, the great majority of NORP, and particularly of NORP young people, never see one. They live in the cities. This is their home, and what we must do is to bring the parks to the people. That is what we are doing through this program. Governor, we know that whether it is the beach at GPE, which we declared surplus so that we can have a wonderful surfing beach down there that now can be used, or whether it is QUANTITY, that you, in cooperation with the city and county, will make good use of this land for the people of GPE as they want it to be used. Now, let me turn to this great hospital, and to say something about it and those who administer it that I think needs to be recognized, and particularly should be recognized by ORG. Reference was made by the Mayor CARDINAL in his remarks that in DATE he got an autograph from me. At that time I had just become Vice President of GPE. And DATE, DATE, DATE, I really learned what the people who have built ORG, what ORG, do, not only in GPE, because I visited ORG--it was then ORG, as I recall, in DATE--but I learned what they are doing in the world, because in DATE DATE, Mrs. PERSON and I took a trip clear around the world. CARDINAL PERSON was mayor of GPE. As we visited the countries of Southeast Asia and Southern Asia, we saw several hospitals run by various organizations.

Now a word as to what this hospital will mean. First, to the veterans it means better care, because this will be a great hospital, I can assure you. A hospital is not just a magnificent building like this splendid building, but what really counts in a hospital is the dedication of the doctors and the nurses and the others. And I can assure you this hospital will have the most dedicated doctors, nurses, and personnel we can possibly find, and our veterans will benefit from that. The second thing I think is important to note is that all the community, all the Nation will benefit, because as PERSON, our Veterans Administrator, has often pointed out, and as he was telling me coming out on the plane from GPE DATE, the work that is done in veterans hospitals makes breakthroughs that benefit all the country. For example, the treatment of so-called tropical diseases breakthroughs have been made already as a result of the work that has been done in the very difficult war in which we are presently engaged that we did not think was possible even in World War II, and more will come. So we see this hospital benefiting, as it should, first the veterans and providing better care for them, but beyond that, providing a basis for training for doctors, nurses, and others, and the basis for research which will improve the health of all the country; and then beyond that, as I have indicated, contributing to better health for all the people of the world. So I am sure you can understand why all of us at this very moment, as we make this announcement, can realize that this is an announcement that everybody can support. Without regard to party, we are all for good health. Without regard to party, we are all for better relations between nations.

As you go from GPE to GPE, to GPE, to GPE, to GPE, and then out to GPE, you realize this is a very big country. But also, despite what may be said and heard at tunes running GPE down, you realize GPE is a beautiful country.

The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit. Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men. Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work.

The best briefing paper in the world cannot explain problems as well as someone who deals with those problems on a very daily and direct basis.

There has been much discussion on who should receive the tax rebates--a discussion based too often on purely political considerations. I do not think we can look at this rebate on a political basis. We have to look on how a rebate will affect all NORP. It is sometimes fashionable to talk as if what is good for the NORP economy is not good for the NORP people.

When the economy is sound, it means the people of this Nation are able to live comfortably without fear of inflation and with jobs.

For DATE, in all the wealthy countries of the world, because of changes in the global environment, because of the growth of technology, because of increasing competition, the middle class that was created and enlarged by the wise policies of expanding trade at the end of World War II has been under severe stress.

But I want to say to my fellow NORP, when you live in a time of change the only way to recover your security and to broaden your horizons is to adapt to the change, to embrace it, to move forward. Nothing we do, nothing we do in this great capital can change the fact that factories or information can flash across the world, that people can move money around in the blink of an eye. Nothing can change the fact that technology can be adopted, once created, by people all across the world and then rapidly adapted in new and different ways by people who have a little different take on the way the technology works. For DATE, the winds of global competition have made these things clear to any NORP with eyes to see. The only way we can recover the fortunes of the middle class in this country so that people who work harder and smarter can at least prosper more, the only way we can pass on the NORP dream of DATE to our children and their children for DATE is to adapt to the changes which are occurring.

And I believe that that is many more jobs than will be lost, as inevitably some will be, as always happens when you open up the mix to a new range of competition.

Most NORP do not know this, but the average NORP citizen, even though wages are much lower in GPE, the average NORP citizen is now spending $MONEY per year per person to buy NORP goods.

These side agreements will make a difference. The environmental agreement will, for the first time ever, apply trade sanctions against any of the countries that fails to enforce its own environmental laws.

We are also particularly grateful as a nation to the people of his country and to President PERSON for their unswerving support for us in the trying times since the innocent NORP diplomats were captured by militants in GPE and held hostage. President PERSON has used his influence on a political basis to intercede for those hostages held captive and has also led other deeply religious nations, on his own initiative, in calling for DATE of prayer and personally led a prayer meeting in his country for the safety and wellbeing and the freedom of the NORP hostages.

Tragically, we now have CARDINAL individuals that have passed away from ENTITY, the novel Coronavirus. GPE has conducted CARDINAL tests, that includes our CARDINAL labs of which CARDINAL of those tests were done by our labs, but those labs, as I noted DATE, had been supplemented by hospitals from ORG to a number of ORG as well as our private lab ORG in GPE. I will remind you that ORG currently is operating just CARDINAL lab in GPE and conducting CARDINAL tests on a DATE basis.

But the total number North of CARDINAL, and we are increasing our capacity on an TIME basis, not just a DATE basis. Accordingly, we have advanced a partnership that was initiated DATE with ORG, the health and life science subsidiary of ORG. We advanced that partnership with the idea of bringing to market the capacity for individuals that have developed mild symptoms or are concerned about their status from the perspective of being a vulnerable population, being our seniors or higher risk of contracting the disease to give them the opportunity to go on this portal, to answer specific questions, to be scored in terms of their likelihood to be needed to be tested, and then be allowed and directed the opportunity to be tested at what will be at launch to specific sites, CARDINAL in GPE, CARDINAL in GPE. That portal, that page that allows people to interface will go align DATE and we will then begin to make reservations, and people throughout the course of DATE will be in the opportunity to get the mobile testing that so many are discussing and so many have promoted.

There is simply no other interface that exists in GPE that allows people a portal that has questions and the capacity to geospatially identify where people are so we can identify the closest areas for mobile testing that we are aware of in the country. And so we are very encouraged by this partnership, very enthusiastic to finally announce it. I know there is been some conversations about it in the media, but it is going live DATE in TIME, fully operational in the first CARDINAL piloted areas in our state. We have the capacity currently through the assets in hand, be it swabs, issue that I will discuss in a moment, the issue of swabs. Not just the issue of reagents, not just the issue of RNA extraction kits that are part of our testing regime, but also the availability of swabs. But the first troche we have CARDINAL test capacity with the swabs and we will partner with ORG in terms of the diagnostics of those tests. The turnaround is typical at ORG, anywhere from DATE, some cases DATE, is roughly the estimate. People will be automatically notified based upon that screening criteria and based upon that interface on that portal of their test results. If people have severe symptoms, this is not where we want you to be tested. If you have severe symptoms, you need to engage the medical community directly. So we want to remind people, this is not to substitute that interface, but to supplement our capacity to get people that have some mild concerns and or people that are higher risks to remove them from overburdening our healthcare delivery system, to get them out of that setting and to allow people with the kind of portability that mobile testing provides to get answers quickly. But again, it is just a test, and so I just want to remind people of that framework and not promote it for something that it is not . So we are moving into next phase as it relates to testing in GPE.

As it relates to the purpose of developing these partnerships, the purpose of our testing that is to identify through community surveillance where we are so that we could begin to process how we need to manage the status quo and how we need to anticipate the growth and spread of the virus and look at allocating resources across the state accordingly I mentioned this DATE. I will remind folks, we have CARDINAL hospital beds in the state at CARDINAL different hospitals. We have surge capacity in our state just shy of CARDINAL beds, that is CARDINAL beds to be exact, and that is on the basis of current survey that is very contemporary of the existing hospital system. We have CARDINAL ICU beds in our system, but that is not just for adults. That also includes pediatric ICUs. It is just shy of CARDINAL when you add the CARDINAL numbers up. We have new and detailed information about access to ventilators over CARDINAL. CARDINAL ventilators currently reside in our hospitals and we have procured new ventilators, CARDINAL that we were able to purchase, and we also have our own cash both through our ORG and our ORG sites that include an additional CARDINAL ventilators, in addition to the CARDINAL that I referenced. So I give you those numbers because a lot of people have asked about that information. I also make that point as a point of consideration and segue to the subsequent announcement, and that is as we manage this disease and the dynamic nature of this moment, we need to anticipate spread but we also need to prioritize our focus. The purpose of DATE's announcement is to focus on specifically what we mean by that. Most important thing again is to protect the most vulnerable, protect our seniors.

We are doing so with our eyes wide open at the magnitude of what that means and the need to provide wraparound services to support our seniors in need of medical supplies and need of meals and the like. The team assembled behind me and the people in this, what we refer to as soccer state operation center, of where we reside at the moment currently have CARDINAL task forces that are working on a panoply of issues from logistics, from things as basic as not just food but water, fuel and basic supplies to more complex issues related to workforce and the like. So we are looking at this from a very holistic perspective and holistic lens. We recognize that social isolation for CARDINAL of NORP is anxiety inducing, but we recognize what all of the science bears out and what we recognize around the rest of the world that we need to meet this moment head on and lean in, not isolate ourselves to this moment, but lean in and own this moment and take actions that we think are commensurate with the need to protect the most vulnerable NORP. Number CARDINAL, we are directing at all bars, nightclubs, wineries, brewpubs and the like be closed in GPE. We believe that this is a non essential function in our state, and we believe that is appropriate under the circumstances to move in that direction. As it relates to restaurants, we have more nuanced concerns and considerations. Some have suggested just shutting down all of our restaurants.

So that is on the restaurant side. Let me just briefly make this point. There is a concern around access to food for those that cannot prepare their own food. Not everybody has kind of kitchen you or I may have, not everybody is capable of heating their food. Now we are talking about home isolation. Not everybody is able now to go out to grocery store to get that food. Some may have limited capacities relates to deliveries, but we want to expand the points of access to get those deliveries. Restaurants by definition provide those points of access.

Number CARDINAL, in relationship to seniors as our top priority and home isolation, as it relates to bars and new guidelines on restaurants, I referenced the issue of homelessness.

As it relates to, again, vulnerable populations, you saw DATE we put out guidance as it relates to an executive order directing along the lines of what the ORG and others have been recommending. We codified that in GPE on visitation in our senior facilities, our skilled nursing facilities, our assisted living facilities. We now are tightening those directives to just end of life visitation, and that includes hospitals, not just congregate living facilities in the state. That is also a part of what we are advancing here DATE. So that gives you a sense of some of the current thinking of our healthcare professionals.

CARDINAL out of CARDINAL of the largest districts in GPE have already shut down. The one remaining in that group is current high school district which has remained open.

After all, the NORP presence in GPE is a major impediment to improved GPE relations, and we would like to remove it. Unfortunately, the NORP answer on a date for rapid withdrawal has been silence. Instead we have seen the GPE regime announce a phantom cease-fire and propose a transitional government, one that would leave this discredited and doomed group in control. that of the NORP people, speaking through their resistance representatives.

PERSON was the very first enlisted man in the history of our country to rise to become Chief of Naval Operations. He brought extraordinary energy and dedication and good humor to every post he held in a long and distinguished career. From Southeast Asia to Europe, he devoted his life to serving our Nation. I am personally grateful for the central role he played in planning our mission in GPE, both when he commanded our forces in southeastern Europe and later when he came here to GPE.

First, I am directing that effective immediately, our ORG discontinue the use of all so-called dumb antipersonnel mines, those which remain active until detonated or cleared. The only exception will be for those mines required to defend our NORP troops and our allies from aggression on the Korean Peninsula and those needed for training purposes. The rest of these mines, CARDINAL in all, will be removed from our arsenals and destroyed by DATE. Just as the world has a responsibility to see to it that a child in GPE can walk to school in safety, as Commander in Chief, my responsibility is also to safeguard the safety, the lives of our men and women in uniform. Because of the continued and unique threat of aggression in the Korean Peninsula, I have therefore decided that in any negotiations on a ban, GPE will and must protect our rights to use the mines there. We will do so until the threat is ended or until alternatives to landmines become available. Until an international ban takes effect, GPE will reserve the right to use socalled smart mines or self-destructing mines as necessary, because there may be battlefield situations in which these will save lives of our soldiers. Let me emphasize, these smart mines are not the hidden killers that have caused so much suffering around the world. They meet standards set by international agreement. They destroy themselves within DATE, and they pose virtually no threat to civilian life once a battle is over. But under the comprehensive international ban we seek, use of even these smart antipersonnel mines would also be ended. We are determined that lands around the world will never again be sown with terror. That is why I will propose a resolution at the 51st ORG DATE, urging the nations of the world to support a worldwide ban on landmines.

Another way to help, by the way-or a way to help deal with rising costs is to understand the impact rising costs have on small businesses. A lot of big businesses are able to absorb the costs because they have got the capacity to negotiate better. When you have got a large universe of people that you are trying to cover, you can have more strength in negotiations. It gives you a better hand. The problem we have with small businesses is they do not have the capacity to pool together, to negotiate on behalf of a lot of people.

ORG needs to pass this piece of legislation. It is good for the entrepreneurs of GPE. Lower income NORP should be helped with health care by refundable tax credits. It is been a part of my budget. It will help with the issue of the uninsured. People with health savings accounts, when they buy high deductible insurance policies to protect them against catastrophic medical costs or hospitalization or major surgery, should be allowed to deduct those premiums. See, that will help with the rising costs of health care as well. Those are some practical suggestions for ORG to look at, ways to strengthen the private delivery of medicine as opposed to strengthening the Government involvement in medicine. There is something else we can do at the Federal level, and that is to promote promising health information technology. The truth of the matter is, medicine is on the leading edge of change.

Appraising correctly the hopelessness of the situation, I again invited both operators and workers to meet with me, and tendered a means of settlement so justly inspired that it was difficult to see how anyone believing in industrial peace and justice to all concerned could decline it. In substance, it called on the operators to open their mines, on the mine workers to resume work at the same pay and under the same working conditions as prevailed at the time the strike began. In turn, the Government was to create at once a coal commission, or CARDINAL of them, if preferred by all parties to the dispute, so that one could deal with the bituminous situation, the other with the problems in the anthracite field. The commission was to be instructed to direct its first inquiry to the rate of wage to be paid for the period ending DATE, and then to enter upon a fact-finding inquiry into every phase of the industry, and point the way to avoid future suspensions in production. The disputants all indorsed the suggestion of a fact-finding commission. The anthracite operators promptly accepted the entire proposal. The mine workers refused to resume work under the arbitration plan. The majority of the bituminous operators filed an acceptance, but a considerable minority declined the proposal.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

In some instances concrete proof of effective readiness to protect all men, strikers and nonstriking workmen alike, was promptly given. The simple but significant truth was revealed that, except for such coal as comes from the districts worked by nonorganized miners, the country is at the mercy of ORG. Governors in various states reported that their operators and miners had no dispute and were eager to resume production. District leaders informed me that their workmen were anxious to return to their jobs but that they were not permitted to do so. CARDINAL of wives of workmen have addressed ORG, beseeching a settlement, alleging that they know no grievance, and there is an unending story of appeals for relief where necessity or suffering were impelling, where a mere expression of need ought to find ready compliance. At every stage, the Government has been a just neutral regarding wage scales and working contracts. There are fundamental evils in our present system of producing and distribution which make the wage problem difficult. In the bituminous coal fields are vastly more miners than are requisite to the country's needs, and there are CARDINAL more mine workers than are needed to produce in continuous employment the country's normal requirements. By continuous employment I mean DATE in DATE. In many instances DATE men were employed DATE, in some cases much fewer than that. In the overmanned sections men divide the working time, and high wages are necessary to meet the cost of the barest living.

I am speaking now on behalf of mine workers, mine operators, and the NORP public. It will bring protection to all and point the way to continuity of production and the better economic functioning of the industry in the future. The necessity for such a searching national investigation with constructive recommendation is imperative. At the moment the coal skies are clearing, but unless we find a cure for the economic ills which affect the industry and therein find a basis for righteous relationship, we shall be faced with a like menacing situation on DATE on the expiration of the wage contracts which are now being made. The need for such investigation and independent consideration is revealed by both operators and mine workers in the provision in the GPE agreement so recently made. The Government will gladly cooperate with the industry in this program so far as it is the public interest so to do, but I have an unalterable conviction that no lasting satisfaction or worth-while results will ensue unless we may have a Government commission, independent of the industry, clothed with authority by the ORG to search deeply, so that it may advise as to fair wages and as to conditions of labor and recommend the enactment of laws to protect the public in the future. The almost total exhaustion of stocks of coal, the crippled condition of the railways, the distressed situation that has arisen and might grow worse in our great cities due to the shortage of anthracite, the suffering which might arise in the Northwest through failure to meet the DATE needs by lake transportation, all these added to the possibility of outrageous price demands, in spite of the most zealous voluntary efforts of the Government to restrain them, make it necessary to ask you to consider at once some form of temporary control of distribution and prices.

I do not mean that all interstate coal shall be handled by such a federal organization; perhaps none will be necessary; but it will restore its capital to ORG and will be the instrumentality of guarding the public interest where private conscience is insensible to a public need. This proposal does not relate to any possible employment in intrastate shipments. Price restraint and equitable distribution in intrastate shipments is a responsibility of the state's own government. In such voluntary activities as have been carried on thus far the federal Government has endeavored to reestablish the authority and responsibility in the states which was undermined in the necessary centralization of authority during the World War. The public menace in the coal situation was made more acute and more serious at DATE by the strike of ORG in the railroad service-a strike against a wage decision made by ORG, directly affecting CARDINAL men. The justice of the decision is not for discussion here. The decision has been lost sight of in subsequent developments. In any event, it was always possible to appeal for rehearing and the submission of new evidence, and it is always a safe assumption that a Government agency of adjustment deciding unjustly will be quick to make right any wrong. ORG was created by ORG for the express purpose of hearing and deciding disputes between the carriers and their employees, so that no controversy need lead to an interruption in interstate transportation. Wages had, mounted upward, necessarily and justly, during the war upheaval, likewise the cost of transportation, so that the higher wages might be paid. It only held that ORG was the lawful agency of the Government to hear and decide disputes, and its authority must be sustained, as the law contemplates. This must be so, whether the carriers or the employees ignore its decisions. Unhappily a number of decisions of this board had been ignored by the carriers. In CARDINAL instance, however, had a decision, challenged by a carrier, been brought to the attention of ORG, and this decision was promptly carried to the courts and has recently been sustained in the federal ORG. The public or the ORG had no knowledge of the ignored decisions in other cases, because they did not hinder transportation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

The law creating ORG is inadequate. Contrary to popular impression, it has little or no power to enforce its decisions. It can impose no penalties on either party disregarding its decisions. It cannot halt a strike, and manifestly ORG deliberately omitted the enactment of compulsory arbitration. The decisions of the board must be made enforceable and effective against carriers and employees alike. But the law is new, and no perfection of it by ORG at this moment could be helpful in the present threatened paralysis of transportation. Happily it is always lawful and ofttimes possible to settle disputes outside of court, so, in a desire to serve public welfare, I ventured upon an attempt at mediation. Those who had preceded me in attempted settlements had made some progress. I submitted to the officials of the striking employees and the chairman of ORG, in writing, on DATE, a tentative proposal for settlement. Knowing that some of the carriers had offended by ignoring the decisions of the board, and the employees had struck when they had a remedy without the strike, I felt it was best to start all over again, resume work, all to agree to abide faithfully by the board's decisions, make it a real tribunal of peace in transportation, and everybody serve the public. The barrier to be surmounted was the question of seniority. By the workmen these rights are held to be sacred, and unsurrendered by a strike. By the carriers the preservation of seniority is the weapon of discipline on the CARDINAL hand and the reward of faithful employees on the other. In the tentative proposal which I sponsored it was provided that everybody should go to work, with seniority rights unimpaired, that there should be no discrimination by either workmen or carriers against workmen who did or did not strike. I realized that the proposal must carry a disappointment to employees who had inherited promotion by staying loyally on the job, and to such new men as had sought jobs looking to permanent employment, but I wanted the fresh start and maintained transportation service, and I appraised the disappointment of the few to be less important than the impending misfortune to the nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

I believed the sacrifice brought to the men involved could be amply compensated for by the carriers in practical ways. I believed that the matter of transcendent importance was the acceptance of the proposal to respect ORG decisions on the questions which formed the issue at the time of the strike. The public compensation would be complete in guarding by law against recurrence. The proposal was rejected by the carriers. Though the rejection did not end all negotiation, it left the Government only, CARDINAL course- to call the striking workmen to return to work, to call the carriers to assign them to work, and leave the dispute about seniority to ORG for decision. When negotiation or mediation fails, this is the course contemplated by the law and the Government can have no chart for its course except the law. To this call a majority of the carriers responded favorably, proposing to reemploy all strikers except those guilty of violence against workmen or property, to restore the striking workmen to their old positions where vacant, or to like positions where vacancies are filled; questions of seniority which can not be settled between the employer and employees to go to ORG for decision. The minority of the carriers proposed to assign jobs to workmen on strike only where the positions were vacant. Thus the narrative brings us to the present moment, but it has not included the developments which have heightened the Government's concern. Sympathetic strikes have developed here and there, seriously impairing interstate commerce. Deserted transcontinental trains in the desert regions of the Southwest have revealed the cruelty and contempt for law on the part of some railway employees, who have con-spired to paralyze transportation, and lawlessness and violence in a CARDINAL places have revealed the failure of the striking unions to hold their forces to law observance. Men who refused to strike and who have braved insult and assault and risked their lives to serve the public need have been cruelly attacked and wounded or killed. Men seeking work and guards attempting to protect lives and property, even officers of the federal Government, have been assaulted, humiliated, and hindered in their duties.

Under these conditions of hindrance and intimidation there has been such a lack of care of motive power that the deterioration of locomotives and the noncompliance with the safety requirements of the law are threatening the breakdown of transportation. This very serious menace is magnified by the CARDINAL of losses to fruit growers and other producers of perishable foodstuffs, and comparable losses to farmers who depend on transportation to market their grains at harvest time. Even worse, it is hindering the transport of available coal when industry is on the verge of paralysis because of coal shortage, and life and health are menaced by coal famine in the great centers of population. Surely the threatening conditions must impress the ORG and the country that no body of men, whether limited in numbers and responsible for railway management or powerful in numbers and the necessary forces in railroad operation, shall be permitted to choose a course which so imperils public welfare. Neither organizations of employers nor workingmen's unions may escape responsibility. When related to a public service the mere fact of organization magnifies that responsibility and public interest transcends that of either grouped capital or organized labor. Another development is so significant that the hardships of the moment may well be endured to rivet popular attention to necessary settlement. It is fundamental to all freedom that all men have unquestioned rights to lawful pursuits, to work and to live and choose their own lawful ways to happiness. In these strikes these rights have been denied by assault and violence, by armed lawlessness. In many communities the municipal authorities have winked at these violations, until liberty is a mockery and the law a matter of community contempt. It is fair to say that the great mass of organized workmen do not approve, but they seem helpless to hinder. These conditions can not remain in free GPE. If free men can not toil according to their own lawful choosing, all our constitutional guaranties born of democracy are surrendered to mobocracy and the freedom of CARDINAL is surrendered to the small minority which would have no law.

CARDINAL specific thing I must ask at your hands at the earliest possible moment. It is a measure, in short, to create a jurisdiction for the federal courts through which the national Government will have appropriate power to protect aliens in the rights secured to them under treaties and to deal with crimes which affect our foreign relations. The matter has been before ORG on many previous occasions. President PERSON, in his first DATE message, advised ORG that inasmuch as the Government is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth, it ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other. President PERSON asked for the same bestowal of jurisdiction, having encountered deep embarrassment which grew out of the lynching of CARDINAL aliens in GPE in DATE. President PERSON, dealing with a like problem in DATE, asked the conferring upon federal courts jurisdiction in that class of international cases where the ultimate responsibility of the federal Government may be involved. President PERSON uttered a like request to ORG in DATE, and President PERSON pointed out the defect in the present federal jurisdiction when he made his inaugural address in DATE. He declared that it puts our Government in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagement to protect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform these engagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in states or cities not within our control. If we would promise, we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise. We can not permit the possible failure of justice, due to local prejudice in any state or municipal government, to expose us to the risk of war which might be avoided if federal jurisdiction were asserted by suitable legislation by ORG. My renewal of this oft-made recommendation is impelled by a pitiable sense of federal impotence to deal with the shocking crime at GPE, GPE, which so recently shamed and horrified the country.

I have felt the deep current of popular resentment that the federal Government has not sought to efface this blot from our national shield, that the federal Government has been tolerant of the mockery of local inquiry and the failure of justice in GPE. It is the regrettable truth that the federal Government can not act under the law.

We are reinvigorating our response to ENTITY/ENTITY here at home and around the world. We are working closely with the ORG to renew ORG, and I look forward to signing it into law in the very near future. We are rescinding the discriminatory ban on entry to GPE based on ENTITY status. The regulatory process to enact this important change is already underway. And we also know that ENTITY/ENTITY continues to be a public health threat in many communities, including right here in GPE. PERSON, the Director of ORG, recently held a forum in GPE, GPE, and is holding forums across the country to seek input as we craft a national strategy to address this crisis. We should not be punishing patriotic NORP who have stepped forward to serve this country. We should be celebrating their willingness to show such courage and selflessness on behalf of their fellow citizens, especially when we are fighting CARDINAL wars. We cannot afford to cut from our ranks people with the critical skills we need to fight any more than we can afford, for our military's integrity, to force those willing to do so into careers encumbered and compromised by having to live a lie. So I am working with the ORG, its leadership, and the Members of the ORG and ORG on ending this policy. Legislation has been introduced in the ORG to make this happen. That is my commitment to you. It is no secret that issues of great concern to gays and lesbians are ones that raise a great deal of emotion in this country. We can see that with the time and dedication it took to pass hate crimes legislation. But these issues also go to the heart of who we are as a people. Are we a nation that can transcend old attitudes and worn divides? Can we embrace our differences and look to the hopes and dreams that we share?", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthehumanrightscampaignannualdinner", "title": "Remarks at the Human Rights Campaign Annual Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-human-rights-campaign-annual-dinner", "publication_date": "10-10-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

For the struggle waged by ORG is about more than any policy we can enshrine into law. It is about our capacity to love and commit to one another. It is about whether or not we value as a society that love and commitment. It is about our common humanity and our willingness to walk in someone else's shoes, to imagine losing a job not because of your performance at work but because of your relationship at home, to imagine worrying about a spouse in the hospital with the added fear that you will have to produce a legal document just to comfort the person you love, to imagine the pain of losing a partner of DATE and then discovering that the law treats you like a stranger.

So I think that reflects the seriousness with which we approach this matter, our concern about some of the allegations that have been made. But I just wanted to make sure that it was understood that there is a -- that the disability claims issue is not the same issue that is being discussed when we talk about the allegations in GPE. I think part of the confusion is when you and others have been asked about the problems in terms of veterans getting the health care that they need and deserve, you have answered with talking points on the disability claim backlog. So are you really -- I mean, are you suggesting that this is a problem that is limited to the GPE office?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-124", "publication_date": "16-05-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

What I have been saying is that under Secretary PERSON's leadership there has been a firm dedication to providing the kind of services that our veterans deserve. It is reflected in some of the decisions that were made to increase access to disability claims and to health care. We have under his leadership reduced veterans homelessness by PERCENT. We have provided Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to CARDINAL students. And we have decreased the disability claims. My point is that when I talk about the progress that has been made, I have been referring to questions about Secretary PERSON and his leadership of ORG, and that progress has come on his watch and he certainly deserves credit for it. Do you think it sounds strange, though, that given the evidence that we are seeing coming out and suggestions that veterans have actually died waiting to get health services -- I think the word you used is essential because you said the suggestion. And this matter is under investigation -- I would point you to what the IG said DATE. But here you are praising the ORG for all the things that have been done under PERSON's leadership. Let me just explain the way you just asked that question. You are saying there is a suggestion that something terrible happened in GPE -- and that is under investigation. But you do not think there is evidence that there has been a real problem with the quality of health care that our veterans are getting? You do not think that this is going to be -- we still need to study this further? You do not think there is enough to act on right now to say that our veterans are not getting the care that they need? you are going to investigate more? We should just accept allegations as true without investigating them? Meanwhile, we are moving aggressively in a host of areas to ensure that our veterans are getting the services and the care that they deserve. And that is reflected not least in the fact that the President has requested increases in the budget for the ORG DATE he has been in office in a time of very tight budgets. And he has insisted when it came to the serious matter of the disability backlog that we attack that problem with aggression and with substantial resources, and that is resulted in the reduction in the backlog.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-124", "publication_date": "16-05-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It seems to me he has made a conclusion in his mind that something bad happened. I think I would refer you to his testimony. And that is an opinion shared by the President, by Secretary PERSON, and I think everyone else who has looked at this matter and works on these issues. Why has not he expressed it? The President was asked about the allegations and answered forthrightly and expressed his concern about it. The actions that we have taken reflect the concern that we have about it. And the fact that he has sent CARDINAL of his most trusted and top aides from ORG over to the ORG to assist the Secretary in his review reflects the seriousness with which we take this matter. But, again, I would simply say that it stands to reason that when allegations are made, it is important that they are investigated to find out the truth behind the matter before we just assume that what happened or what is said to have happened is true. I am not in any way prejudging, because I do not think we ought to prejudge. I do think that it is a matter of enough concern that the actions that Secretary PERSON has taken and the actions that the President and ORG have taken are merited, and we will continue to aggressively tackle this problem. Should the NORP people be able to trust -- the President says he is -- you said the President is sending over CARDINAL of his most trusted aides to oversee this. Wasn't General PERSON CARDINAL of his most trusted aides?

I would simply say that it is an important matter and that the resources necessary to tackle it so that we are providing the services and benefits that veterans deserve are merited, and the attention that is paid to it by those who are concerned about the problem as opposed to politics is absolutely appropriate.

But the security situation is apparently so bad that the President of the country cancelled a visit to the area DATE. I think the fact that the security situation, because of ORG, is real is one that is self-evident and which I discussed TIME.

And that requires coordination and it requires strategy. And I assume that these conversations will be focused on that effort. Going back to ORG's line of questioning, you have PERSON, who is the Director of ORG, talking about some of her frustrations, frustrations on the part of GPE with the NORP government's slow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics. Can you flesh out what some of the other frustrations are that the GPE feels in terms of working with the government of GPE? Well, look, I think that the challenge that GPE faces from this group is a serious one, and there are all sorts of issues that she and others have identified that make the challenge even greater and that we try to address as a friend of GPE in the assistance that we provide. That is why we provide security assistance, to increase GPE's capacity to meet the threat, including by helping professionalize its military and helping it carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. It is why we provide law enforcement assistance, to help GPE bring those responsible for attacks on civilians to justice. It is why we support programs and initiatives that are aimed at combating violent extremist ideology, including by creating economic alternatives for those vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist organizations. So we have a coordinated effort that is designed to help strengthen GPE's ability to respond responsibly and effectively to these challenges in a way that ensures civilians are protected and human rights are respected. And responding responsibly and effectively is important because that is , in effect, how you provide support for and reassurance to the population that is also having to deal with the threat posed by an organization like ORG.

But the way that this all came out -- even if you are going to keep calling them all allegations and they seem to be more widespread than CARDINAL hospital -- does not that in itself indicate a major shortfall in his oversight and leadership of the administration? PERSON, I think I have addressed this question. What we have seen in response to the allegations that have been reported is a review instigated by the Secretary, one that we are now providing a senior ORG official to assist -- My question is the way it came out, that this was all -- all of these problems that have been built up and widespread, it all came out through reporting by the press, that some of this was not even known about. So does not that, in and of itself, indicate a major shortfall there? Well, I'd say a couple of things about that. First of all, there are active reviews and investigations into what happened, and I think, again, I am not going to pass judgment on what happened until we have seen the conclusion of an investigation. Separately, should some of these allegations prove to be true, Secretary PERSON has made clear that he would be outraged by that and angry by that -- the President certainly would be -- and he would expect people to be held accountable. On the role of the press, I think the press, in general -- and again, I am not going to pass judgment on whether or not the allegations are true because we do not know, but the role of the press is important in general as a -- on matters like this and in so many other areas.

On the GPE elections, a statement that the Vice President put out DATE used the word, delegitimize in the statement, that GPE would face additional costs should it disrupt or delegitimize the election results. My question is a follow-up on a question earlier, which is who is the arbiter for the results of the election, whether they are disrupted or delegitimized, since sectoral sanctions would be so important to determine a range. Who decides that?

GPE and the rest of our partners in the international community who have taken CARDINAL side on this matter, and GPE, which has taken another side, I think will make judgments about how the elections proceed.

Well, first of all, PERSON sent those people after Pearl Harbor, after there was an attack and after GPE declared war on GPE, when the whole future of Europe was at stake. What has happened here is that NORP nations under the ORG mandate have gone into GPE not for the purpose of ending the war but for the purpose of preserving the ORG mission of preserving some limitation on the fighting and some humanitarian aid. We have acted in support of that in several ways. We have provided through our air power the longest humanitarian airlift in history, now longer than the GPE airlift. We have worked hard to get our ORG allies to agree to use not only the threat but the reality of air power to stop the war in GPE from spreading to the air. We have shot down planes in aid of that objective to protect GPE and other safe areas. And we are aggressively involved with our NORP allies in trying to get a peace agreement. I do not think it is an appropriate thing for GPE to send ground troops to GPE to become involved in the conflict itself. Now, if we reach an agreement in which ORG has a responsibility to enforce the agreement along lines agreed to by the parties, that is a different matter altogether. GPE still has troops in the Middle East enforcing the agreement reached by GPE and GPE at the FAC accord. If we are talking about limiting the conflict, we have troops now in GPE, in the former NORP Republic of GPE, designed to limit the conflict. I think that that is the appropriate thing for us. I think the NORP have done the right thing in putting their troops in in the ORG mandate to try to limit the fighting. But in the end, these parties are going to have to make an agreement. Otherwise, there is a risk that they will collapse the ORG mission. They are going to have to decide that they cannot win, either side, by fighting and make an agreement.

I said that any discussion of that, any discussion of that, could not proceed until there was some sort of cessation of hostilities and that I personally would not favor changing the position of GPE, which is that that embargo should not be lifted until there is a peace agreement in force in GPE and some other changes have occurred in GPE.

There are NORP soldiers in GPE; they do not want them subject to attack, to capture because the arm's embargo has been lifted.

Look, I wanted to open CARDINAL new businesses DATE -this was a fellow who was in the fast-food franchise business, but he said, With all that is going on relative to the proposed new legislation on taxes, I am afraid to build any more restaurants. I heard that over and over TIME. Let me just mention CARDINAL or CARDINAL things that should be reassuring to small businesses. If these provisions of my plan pass, first of all, anybody who starts a new venture will be able to get investment for that new venture. And if the investment is held for DATE, the tax rates will be much, much lower than the ordinary income tax rates, if it passes. Secondly, for ongoing small businesses, DATE the write-off for expensing on the tax form is $MONEY per year. We propose to raise that to $MONEY. That will be a substantial reduction in the tax burden of most small businesses and will be an encouragement, I think, for them to hire more people. Thirdly, if someone has a chain of restaurants, for example, like the person who called in, in the plan that I presented to the ORG that ORG adopted, we have some changes in the alternative minimum tax provisions which operate as real incentives for people to continue to invest their profits in the expansion of their businesses without running up bigger tax bills. So I would urge the small business people who are listening to us to really look at what is in that ORG bill. There are a lot of very strong pro-business and pro-small business provisions in the bill that have not gotten a lot of attention. That is why, let me just mention, ORG and ORG, CARDINAL groups not normally associated with ORG, have already strongly endorsed this economic program because of the incentives for economic growth and because it is bringing down long-term interest rates. Any business person who has to borrow money in all probability is going to save more money in lower-interest rates than they will pay in higher taxes.

That is a problem, by the way, for wealthy countries throughout the world. Even GPE's having trouble creating jobs now. But look what is happened since I announced my plan and it started to pass its way through ORG, just in DATE.

What are you doing or what can you do to get Senator PERSON's vote? And do you think you will ultimately get it? I do not know the answer to the last question, but what I have done is to try to take the strengths of both ORG and ORG versions of the bill and try to put them together. The strength of the ORG version was it had fewer overall taxes and was even more progressive. The strength of the ORG version was it had much more economic incentives, more economic growth incentives, for research and development, for investment in new firms, for small business, the things of that kind. So the argument that I am going to be making to all these Senators is that this plan now clearly has MONEY in deficit reduction; it will now have more spending cuts than tax increases in it; it will have PERCENT of the new tax burden now borne by people with incomes above $MONEY; that the middle class tax burden is now down to $MONEY a year; and that the economic growth incentives qualifying, for example, PERCENT plus of the small businesses in the country for a reduction in taxes if they invest more in their companies; and enabling the working poor through the earned-income tax credit to lift themselves above poverty by working full time The people who are leaning against this program or have announced against it-not the NORP, that is almost entirely a political deal; the NORP have even opposed the conservative amendments to our budget to control entitlements and impose discipline. There are those who think it is the right thing for the country, but they are afraid there is been so much misinformation out there about it that they will get beat if they vote for it. The only thing I would say to the latter group is that we do have to do something on entitlements, but we cannot get there until we do something to reform health care spending overall, and that this is a major step that will stabilize the financial markets, keep interest rates down, and enable us to move on to health care reform, to getting a world trade agreement, to welfare reform, to the crime bill, to all these things that are out there crying for attention that we cannot even address if we do not go ahead and get this budget out of the way.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "title": "Interview With Newspaper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-newspaper-editors-0", "publication_date": "02-08-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And ORG has already cut another MONEY off the budget that we cannot fully count yet because the ORG has not acted. But when they do, we will have even more cuts. Let me pass on to you a question I am getting increasingly from Constitution readers. How can you assure that your tax increase package does not have the same result as Mr. PERSON's DATE tax increase package, which is to say no result at all except higher taxes? I can do that in CARDINAL ways. First of all, let us look at what happened in DATE. Why did the deficit reduction package in DATE not produce the deficit reduction it was intended to? But CARDINAL big reason is that they overestimated how much the revenues would bring in; that is, they had some very, very liberal revenue estimates, and those revenues did not materialize. So that within DATE after the package passed, they revised downward the amount of deficit reduction by MONEY. Now, we have instead taken the most conservative revenue estimates we could get. The second thing is that I have pledged to the ORG that by Executive order, I will put all of this money, the spending cuts and the revenue increases, into a trust fund and that every year if we miss the deficit reduction target, I will come forward to the ORG and give them a plan to meet the target, that is, to have further cuts to meet the target, and ask them to vote on it. I might say that we had those requirements in the law, and through the parliamentary rules of the ORG, the NORP took it out of the law. PERCENT of the NORP agree with that budgetary discipline, and they took it out because they thought it was good politics for them to take it out and weaken the bill further. So I am going to do it by Executive order. Now, let me say, there was CARDINAL other thing different from DATE. Because this plan has been taken much more seriously by the financial markets, it has already had a big impact in bringing down long-term interest rates, and that has led CARDINAL of people to refinance their homes and their business loans.

So there are a lot of pro-growth incentives in this plan that were not there in DATE, and those are the principal differences. PERSON is saying that this proposal should be rejected so Members of ORG can go back home, visit with their constituents, get a better feel for the spending cuts that would be accepted, come back in DATE and cut some more. Well, because we have already got more spending cuts than revenue increases, number CARDINAL; because we are going to keep cutting spending, as I have said.

Sir, there is been a good bit of discussion about the timing of the spending cuts, particularly saying that they mostly come in DATE. Could you please comment on the timing of the spending cuts? Well, they were not timed to do that. The fact is that we have more control- when I took over this budget-these budgets are done on a DATE cycle. If you are going to make deep cuts, it is easier to plan for them if you have a little time to plan for them. And also under the previous budget that we inherited, the budgets were already tighter in DATE, and they were much looser, I thought, in DATE. But I assure you, we are not waiting for that. I have already given instructions to my ORG to prepare more budget cuts for DATE. We have reduced the deficit in DATE since I have been in office, mostly because of lower interest rates, by MONEY over and above where it was projected to be. So there are budget cuts in DATE, but it is like planning anything else. If you are going to take big whacks out of a large organization, the longer time goes on, the more you have to plan, the bigger the cuts you can make. Now, let me say CARDINAL other thing. Other people talk about cut first and tax later; most of their cuts are in DATE, too. They just want to pass them first and then avoid the tough decisions on the taxes. But if you look at the cuts that are proposed by others, if you look at Senator PERSON's cuts on entitlements, almost all of them come in DATE, the meaningful ones.

I think we need to reform the health care system. The people who talk about spending cuts first are basically saying this. We are cutting defense sharply and about all we can. I am concerned that we should not do more. We have cut it quite deeply. For example, that means every dollar we increase ORG, every dollar we increase education and training for workers that have been displaced by defense plants closing down, every dollar we put into new technologies for defense conversion-those are the CARDINAL areas where we basically have increased-we have to cut in veterans affairs, in agriculture, in all these other areas. Already we have a budget that will reduce the ORG work force by CARDINAL people in DATE, and there will be more cuts coming to that, so that is flat. The only thing that is increasing in this budget are the so-called entitlements, and that is basically ORG and ORG and ORG cost of living. We have restrained ORG pay increases and ORG pension increases below where they have been under the previous administrations. They are getting some cost of living, but less than they ordinarily would, and I called for a freeze in DATE. So the real growth is in ORG and ORG, in the health care programs. If you put a lid on them now without reforming the health care system, you must do CARDINAL of CARDINAL things that I think are not good. CARDINAL is to charge middle class elderly people more for their ORG and much more if you are going to make them pay it all. Or the second is to not charge them any more, just limit how much ORG pays, and force the doctors and hospitals to shift all the costs to the private sector, which would raise the health insurance premiums of every newspaper on this telephone. That is what is been going on for DATE. I do not dispute those who say if you want to take the deficit from where I take it to down to CARDINAL, you have to deal with entitlements. And it will require more spending cuts, not more tax increases beyond where we are. I agree with that. But my point is you do not get to that until you do this first.

And if push comes to shove, how would you put them in priority of importance if you have to keep CARDINAL and get rid of one? Well, let me just say this. They are both very important to me for different reasons. And I think they are both important to the country. I think, if you are asking how they are doing now, I think the space station is more secure than the super collider, because the space station passed a ORG vote. The second time we got some more votes. But the first time we only carried it by a couple of votes when CARDINAL good friends of mine who went down to vote against it stayed to the end and changed their vote so we could save it because they knew it was important to me and, I think, to the country, as I said. So we have redesigned the space station after a serious review by an eminent team of national scientists. It is very important to maintain our leadership in space technology. It is very important in terms of new partnerships with GPE to keep them involved in this kind of technology, to reduce the incentive they have to sell weapons and keep them taking their nuclear force down. But most important, it is a big economic boom to us. If we get out of this, the NORP will move right in, take this over, and have a lot of those high-wage jobs that NORP should have. The super collider is important, in my judgment, for science and for research, not so much for applied technology now. We do not know for sure what it will produce, but we know that it has the potential to produce a great deal, and we know that other major science research projects like this have often had unintended benefits. It is in more trouble now. And frankly, whether we can save it or not depends entirely on whether we can save it in the ORG. I think then-Senator PERSON clearly saved it in the ORG last time.

But I am strongly supporting it. I am going to do what I can to pass it, and I think we have got a chance to pass it. The key to passing it, frankly, is asking the ORG to look at the national interest and look at the fact that we have to make a significant investment in nondefense research and development and technology. Now that we have cut defense a great deal and we have not offset all the cuts in technology with domestic investments in technology, and that is where a lot of these high wage jobs of the future come from, we cannot permit this to become a debate where the people in GPE took PERCENT of the base closing cuts last time and they complained that GPE took no cuts and that they are voting for new revenues and the GPE Senators want- I mean, if it becomes a deal, you know, a Stateby-GPE deal, I think it is gone.

First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured. Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what is going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I do not , myself, think that it is right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we are going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we are going to bring our costs down, we have got to cover everybody. An employer should bear some responsibility for their employees. And the employee should bear some responsibility, too.

And I know that there have been concerns about the release of this report and the potential dangers it poses. We have taken precautionary measures in our embassies and around the world. There is never a perfect time to release a report like this, but it was important for , I think, to recognize that part of what sets apart is when we do something wrong, we acknowledge it. Is this the responsibility of President PERSON? Did he betray NORP values? Well, as I have said before, after 9/11, I do not think that you can know what it feels like to know that GPE's gone through the worst attack on the continental GPE in its history. So there were a lot of people who did a lot of things right and worked very hard to keep safe, but I think that any fair-minded person looking at this would say that some terrible mistakes were made in allowing these kinds of practices to take place. In part becae, I think, study after study has shown that when people get tortured, when people are beaten, when people are put in a position of severe stress and pain, oftentimes they are willing to say anything to alleviate that stress and pain. So the information we get is not necessary better than doing things the right way, and my goal is to make sure, having banned this practice as one of the first things I did when I came into office, that we do not make that mistake again.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjorgeramosfusionandunivisionnewsnashvilletennessee", "title": "Interview With Jorge Ramos of Fusion and Univision News in Nashville, Tennessee", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jorge-ramos-fusion-and-univision-news-nashville-tennessee", "publication_date": "09-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We are going to focus on new arrivals. Because one of the things that I think is important to understand is that although we are reprioritizing to make sure that we are not in the business of separating families, we are still sending a message to people who have not yet come here, we are going to be enforcing those immigration laws so that newcomers, people who just arrived, you are likely to be sent back.

We spent that entire time trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill done that would solve the problem for all the people.

It struck me as interesting that GPE now has got good enough relations with both-with countries like GPE and GPE and GPE to effect policy which helps our mutual security and our economy-and economy. The most notable example of where that is taking-where it is helping is in GPE. When I visited with PERSON, I spent a lot of time talking about GPE, our mutual desire to effect change with PERSON. But I also had the very same discussion with PERSON and President PERSON. I mentioned it to PERSON. I did not have a bilateral with PERSON, but I did talk to him about it in passing. My point is, is that by working hard to establish good relations on a lot of fronts, when a common problem arises, we can effect the solution in a positive way. I know you asked me, PERSON , about the NORP reaction. I did not exactly see what official said it. But I-what I hope my answer conveyed to you in public there was that this requires a degree of patience, because PERSON is used to being able to deal bilaterally with GPE. But the change of policy now is, is that he must deal with other nations, most notably GPE. And I was pleased with my discussions with PERSON, about his-reaffirming his mutual desire-or his desire, which is our mutual goal, that PERSON disarm. We discussed the security guarantees, what form they may come in. I made it very clear, obviously-I said this during the pool spray there-that a treaty is not going to happen, but there are other ways to effect on paper what I have said publicly- we have no intention of invading.

This was really CARDINAL of the first official meetings of a group of countries after the Cancun talks broke down. And there was a positive statement coming out of the meeting, kind of universal agreement that Cancun was a missed opportunity. Hopefully the missed opportunity will be-will serve as a catalyst. I think people now have taken a step back and said, Well, we did miss an opportunity, and hopefully this will enable the talks-kind of not start at ground zero but have a running start as a result of the missed opportunity. And it is interesting, in the room there is something like PERCENT of all the world trade-was affected-was countries in that room, and therefore it was a, I think, a very positive and strong statement. The other thing was the clear understanding of the countries of the need to fight terror. That is important for GPE, that people continue to recognize that the war on terror goes on. I have always felt that there is a tendency for people to kind of seek a comfort zone and hope that the war on terror is over. And I view it as a responsibility of GPE to remind people of our mutual obligations to deal with the terrorists. That notion of responsible behavior by countries was finally accepted. This was not a-did not require a lot of push. President PERSON understands that when terrorists bomb GPE, it affects economies. It not only-there is a serious economic consequence, same thing we felt on DATE, to our economy.

We had some good discussions there at ORG, but this will be a chance to further our discussions and assure the NORP people that the NORP people are really grateful for the support and mutual efforts to make the world secure.

And it is in our national interest that GPE have good relations with GPE. I listen very carefully to the respected leaders. But first of all, we cannot fix certain disputes; that will be up to the sovereign governments. But we can help facilitate dialogue. We can help facilitate understandings.

Part of the reason that I am stopping in GPE prior to going to the Olympics-I mean, one could have attempted just to go straight to the Olympics, but I want to come to GPE-I had just come from GPE, and it is all part of making sure that our foreign policy is active. I would hope that no President would ever dial us out of the Far East. Quite the contrary, I think it is very important for us to stay actively engaged in the Far East. And CARDINAL such multilateral engagement is the CARDINAL-party talks, all aimed at keeping- dealing with a very delicate issue, but with CARDINAL partners sending the same message to your neighbor to the north. So it is part of a foreign policy vision that is multilateral in nature, with strong bilateral relations that help create an atmosphere in which old grievances and new issues can be solved in a peaceful way. Are you going to deliver the FTA message to NORP? Went to a meeting of ORG for a reason, I went in there to make it clear that this administration absolutely thinks it is essential that ORG pass the NORP FTA.

How would you describe your legacy under your Presidency for Asia and GPE relations? And point CARDINAL, looking ahead with the changes happening with GPE growing stronger, GPE growing stronger, that is going to change the dynamics of the region and the GPE is a global player in the world. How do you see GPE role in that region in the future? Let me start with the second, then you can refresh my DATE-old memory for the first. There is plenty of room for countries to work with-the CARDINAL countries you mentioned with other countries in the region in a constructive way. In other words, I do not view the diplomacy as CARDINAL sum, it is got to be either this country or that country. GPE and GPE and GPE will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs, businesses throughout the region.

Looking ahead, do you think it is important for the NORP people to sort of view GPE mostly as a strategic competitor or more as a partner? I would call it a-I would-I think as we look ahead I would view it as a management of a complex relationship, where sometimes our national interests are aligned and sometimes our national interests are not aligned. They could-and let me just talk about the economy, for example. And CARDINAL reason I call it a complex relationship is that here in GPE, trade with GPE is not necessarily universally accepted as good. It is universally accepted as good in this administration. I mean, free and fair trade is good for the world, and I believe it is good for this relationship. But it is a-some in GPE view the advent of NORP manufacturing, particularly at the lower end of the economic scale, as direct competition with their own livelihood, thereby making the relationship complex. Energy-what is very interesting is that if you view GPE as a market, you want them to become more robust and more prosperous. But in order to do that, GPE is going to have to have more energy, and as GPE demands more energy, it creates more global demand relative to a slower growing supply, means higher prices for us all. It is a very interesting and important relationship made complex by globalization, and their constantly changing internal situation, particularly when it comes their economy. I am sure you have been reading about the GPE discussions. On the CARDINAL hand, we have got very good relations. On the other hand, it was hard to find common ground to get the GPE deal closed. So it is hard to label the relationship CARDINAL way or the other. An NORP President is going to have to pay very close attention to relations with not only GPE, but the region. And I say the region because if it ever-if the perception is ever that GPE is fixated only on GPE, then you are going to have issues with long-time allies, people that have been counting on the NORP support for a period of time.

I understand it is a headache and you are sprinting as fast as you can, but NORP does not seem like they are keeping up with the pace. So maybe you could give me some more breaking news on this end.

That is going to be a proud moment for the NORP people. And I made a decision not to politicize the games; this is for athletics. There is plenty of time for politics, and I am confident I will have time for politics and, you know-look, I have met with the NORP President a lot.

I meet with him all the time, it seems like, at these different forums where GPE is at the table with a lot of other nations in the region.

CARDINAL thing that interests me is to watch GPE's leaders deal with the benefits and challenges of a marketplace. In other words, this is a country that has got a lot of mouths to feed and a lot of people to employ. And they are committed to, in many ways, marketplace principles, particularly as they have invited in foreign capital. And it is been interesting to watch them deal with a combination of the need for raw material versus the-from the foreign policy implications of dealing with a country that has a lot of raw material. The classic case is GPE, where I have spent a lot of time with the NORP President talking about the dangers of GPE having a nuclear weapon, knowing full well that they need fuel in order to meet their own internal pressures. PERSON has been very open in many ways about his concerns and the pressures he feels, as have I. And by the way, that is not easy when there is a language barrier. And yet I can report to you that we do have cordial, relaxed conversations in spite of the fact that we both have interpreters. It is much easier when you are dealing with a person that speaks your own language. Since the only one I speak is English, it is important to have English speakers. But here is a man who I have had some-I feel comfortable talking about his family, and he asks about mine. And that may sound trite to you, but nevertheless, it is a part of getting comfortable with each other. So I guess what is interesting is to- just understanding the tensions that an emerging economy can feel, and particularly given NORP-the NORP role in international affairs, for example, their presence in ORG, Perm 5, which creates interesting tensions. I would say that there is been a-it is just been interesting to watch, and interesting to participate with people.

It is a tough, fast-changing global economy, and a lot of people feel personally insecure. There are also a lot of people who are worried about crime and social breakdown.

There was a recent poll out by the PERSON group that shows that CARDINAL of NORP believe the claims of a recovery.

No, I think-well, I do believe that people have not gotten a lot of the information; I think that is true. But I think-keep in mind what I said first. I think a lot of people may hear that there are more jobs, but they may feel that their personal situation is not more secure.

ORG is a virulent, nasty organization that has gained a foothold in ungoverned spaces effectively in GPE and parts of western GPE. We have to take it seriously. They have shown in GPE what they can do in an organized fashion, and in GPE what we have seen is their ability to proselytize for their perverted brand of ORG and spur small-scale terrorist attacks. We are pounding ORG's core structure in GPE and GPE. We have put together a coalition that is increasingly effective. We have seen ORG lose PERCENT of its populated territory in the region, and both in terms of homeland security and in terms of our efforts over there, I am confident that we are going to prevail. But it is also important for us to keep things in perspective, and this is not an organization that can destroy GPE. This is not a huge industrial power that can pose great risks to us institutionally or in a systematic way. But they can hurt us, and they can hurt our people and our families.

And so I understand why people are concerned about it, and this is a serious situation, but what is important is for people to recognize that the power, the strength of GPE and its allies are not threatened by an organization like this; in the same way that ORG was able to carry out CARDINAL spectacular attack we ended up making some significant changes to harden homeland defenses. It then took awhile for us to ultimately snuff out core ORG in the ORG, and there are still lingering remnants, but at no point was there ever a sense that in fact it could do catastrophic damage to us. You referred to ORG's sophisticated media operation and also referred to what NORP are seeing in the NORP media. Are you suggesting that the media are being played in a sense here? Look, the media is pursuing ratings. I think that, you know, it is up to the media to make a determination about how they want to cover things. There is no doubt that the actions of ORG are designed to amplify their power and the threat that they pose. That helps them recruit, that adds in the twisted thoughts of some young person that they might want to have carry out an action, that somehow they are part of a larger movement. And so I think that the NORP people absorb that, understandably are of concern.

And so part of our goal here is to make sure that people are informed about all the actions that we are taking. But one of the interesting things that you have seen evolve over DATE, including in the debates that are taking place between the NORP candidates, is that those who are critics of our administration response, or the military, the intelligence response that we are currently mounting, when you ask them, well, what would you do instead, they do not have an answer. And the reason they do not have an answer is because the truth is that the approach that we are taking is one that is based on the best counsel and best advice of our top military, top intelligence, top diplomatic teams. And we are going after ORG effectively. We are going after them hard. Your critics have said they want to use more force. You have sometimes responded by suggesting that people who want to use more force want another Iraq War and that that is not practical. Well, when you listen to them, though, and you ask, well, what exactly are you talking about? Well, we are going to bomb more. Where is it that you are going to bomb? When you talk about something like carpet-bombing, what do you mean? We carry out precision strikes based on intelligence of where ORG is, where their infrastructure is, where their oil tankers are. And if the suggestion is is that we kill CARDINAL of innocent NORP and NORP, that is not who we are and that would be a strategy that would have enormous backlash against GPE. It would be terrible for our national security.

Are you avoiding more force because you are concerned that even a little more force might call for the demand for even more force, and you would end up with a large war? What is interesting is that most of the critics have not called for ground forces. To his credit, I think PERSON is one of the few who has been at least honest about suggesting here is something I would do that ORG is not doing. He does not just talk about being louder or sounding tougher in the process. But as I explained, and I have tested this repeatedly with our military intelligence folks, when you start looking at an GPE-type deployment of large numbers of troops - CARDINAL, CARDINAL, CARDINAL troops - we are now in a situation in which we are committing ourselves not only to going door to door in places like GPE and GPE, which I am confident that we could do, but we have essentially said to the NORP and the NORP that we are going to govern for you. And that ends up being of an indefinite period. So part of what we have to do for a sustained defeat of ORG is to help local forces develop capacity, do it the right way, do it for themselves with our assistance and our help, so that we can actually create a stable government structure in this region. Now that sometimes requires more patience than simply deploying a bunch of NORP. Our fighting forces are the best in the world, but in order to defeat an enemy like this, what we have to do is have a situation in which people can govern. You have acknowledged this requires patience. In DATE, before GPE, a ORG official stated that he believed that domestic terrorists were a greater threat to GPE than international groups like ORG or ORG. Do you believe that still now, after GPE and GPE? I do not know the exact citation that you are referring to.

The FAC attack was inspired by PERSON, who was with ORG, ORG in the Peninsula or in GPE, and we have seen periodically self-radicalization through the Internet or jihadist propaganda. But ORG is more systematic and more effective in their media, in their online presence, and that raises additional concerns. So part of what we have to do in response is to ramp up countering that narrative online, working with local communities to make sure that we are inoculating ourselves and our young people from this kind of recruitment. It is a more complicated problem because of the fact that a couple like the GPE couple, you do not see in a way that you would see an organization that is planning a complex plot like 9/11.

My point is, ENTITY, that I think my main advice to my successor - now hopefully by the time I turn over the keys, we have made the kind of progress that I am expecting and will have pushed for over the course of DATE ... Do you think there will be a united front against ORG by then? I think we will have made significant progress in degrading ORG by then. The diplomacy I think is critically important because to the extent that we can get the NORP regime, GPE, GPE to recognize what we believe is the core threat, which is ORG, and the disintegration of social order in NORP-controlled areas in GPE and GPE, the more effective and faster we can go. But what I would say to my successor is that it is important not just to shoot but to aim, and it is important in this seat to make sure that you are making your best judgments based on data, intelligence, the information that is coming from your commanders and folks on the ground, and you are not being swayed by politics. Whoever takes over this office after you might be a NORP, might be a NORP, there may be a NORP ORG again. There likely will be a majority of NORP governors across the country, NORP state legislatures, because NORP have lost so very many elections in DATE.

Second of all, I think we have got a good chance of winning back the ORG, and the truth of the matter is is that where NORP have had problems is we had the misfortune of doing poorly in DATE when there was redistricting, and in many of the successive elections NORP have actually voted at higher rates. This was true in DATE, for example. There were more NORP ballots cast for NORP candidates than there were NORP, but because of where NORP live and where NORP live, and because of the nature of the ORG, we ended up having problems. So one of the things that I will be arguing over the course of DATE is to make sure that NORP run an issue-based campaign on the things that we believe in and care about, and I think we have got a great track record of real progress on a whole range of fronts. If we make those arguments clearly and forthrightly and are not defensive, then I am actually confident we will do just fine. Have you insulated the climate deal, for example, which is so important to your legacy, from being undone by future presidents, given that many of the commitments you made in Paris are not legally binding? Well, keep in mind that ORG in GPE is perhaps literally the only major party in the developed world that is still engaging in climate denial. Even far-right parties in other places acknowledge that the science shows that temperatures are going up and that that is a really dangerous thing we have got to do something about. And the deal that we struck in GPE was an example of NORP leadership at its best. We were able to mobilize CARDINAL countries to make serious commitments that are transparent, where every country is going to be held accountable, where everybody chips in, and it does not solve the entire problem, but it puts the world on track to deal with a problem that could be monumental in its effect if we do not do something about it.

And we have seen this since I came into office. Since my inauguration, the amount of wind power has tripled, the amount of solar power has gone up by CARDINAL times. We have seen the costs of clean energy go down much faster than any of us anticipated. So they cannot stop you? And when we decide - what it means is that by the time that even a NORP president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it is not only a challenge, it is also an opportunity, that it is creating jobs, that it is making a difference in people's lives, that consumers are saving money. When I doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, that puts money in people's pockets. When you retrofit a building so that it is got better temperature control and you cut your light bill by PERCENT PERCENT, you know what? In fact, when it comes to solar power, you have got this weird coalition between environmentalists and ORG-ers in some Western states because the traditional dirty fuel industry is trying to prevent greater utilization of solar power. So a lot of these things get institutionalized not just through government policy but through the impact that it has on the marketplace and the private sector. ENTITY, we are nearing DATE where the question of national identity, who we are, has been a part of CARDINAL large event after another. I made a list here, in fact.

The increase in the advertising of employers seeking workers in all of the metropolitan papers in the country indicates that. The NORP seem to want more.

But we have to operate within a given budget ceiling, so we have to measure what we need to do for our troops and their families off against the absolute imperative of being able to pay for training, which is more and more expensive the more sophisticated the equipment is, the more expensive it is to train on it, which is why we developed so many computer simulations and programs and the need to continue to modernize the equipment . You do not want a bunch of equipment out there that you cannot run because you do not have spare parts, you have not kept upgraded to high safety conditions.

I mean, now, for example, in DATE of college, virtually all NORP families can get a $MONEY tax credit, and if you are in the PERCENT tax bracket, that is MONEY worth of tuition plus a dramatic increase in the scholarships, and a lowering of the cost of the student loans, and tax credits for all other higher education.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjanetlanghartcohenthearmedforcestelevisionnetwork", "title": "Interview With Janet Langhart Cohen of the Armed Forces Television Network", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-janet-langhart-cohen-the-armed-forces-television-network", "publication_date": "25-02-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

You talked about GPE. What are we going to do? Are we going in on the ground? Are we going to be just that PERCENT of ORG, or are we going to be the dominant force? Who is going to command people who go in on the ground? Well, first of all, unless there is an agreement between both parties, we will not go in on the ground, because we did not go in on the ground in GPE until we had an agreement everybody had to agree because we were a peacekeeping force, not a war force designed to win a victory and then enforce the peace. But we will defend ourselves. We will have vigorous rules of engagement if necessary to defend ourselves, just as we have had in GPE.

But what we know about World War II, looking back, is that even though after World War II there was this long twilight struggle of the cold war, it may be that World War II was the last war of mass slaughter of nation-states, certainly in Europe, because we stood up against the totalitarian dictatorships of NORP GPE and their allies.

A lot of these groups themselves are deprived of opportunity.

I wanted to start by getting a sense of your mind-set coming into the job, and as I have understood you - and you can reject this - your perspective is that a mixture of universalist policies, in combination with an increased level of personal responsibility and communal responsibility among NORP, when we talk about these gaps that we see between black and white GPE, that that really is the way forward. I think it is a CARDINAL-legged stool and you left out CARDINAL, which is vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws. So the way we thought about it when we came in is that - and obviously we came in during crisis, so how we might have structured our policy sequencing if, when we came in, the economy was okay, and we were not potentially going into a great recession, and folks were not all losing their homes, might have been different. But as a general matter, my view would be that if you want to get at NORP poverty, the income gap, wealth gap, achievement gap, that the most important thing is to make sure that the society as a whole does right by people who are poor, are working class, are aspiring to a better life for their kids. Those kinds of programs are, by design, universal, but by definition, because they are helping folks who are in the worst economic situations, are most likely to disproportionately impact and benefit NORP. They also have the benefit of being sellable to a majority of the body politic. So you have got something like the ORG , which was on its face a universal program that involved a huge mechanism for wealth accumulation and people entering into the middle class. But if, in its application, black folks were excluded from it, then you have to override that by going after those discriminatory practices. The same would be true for something like ORG, where historically, if you just read the law and the fact that it excluded domestic workers or agricultural workers, you might not see race in it, unless you knew that that covered a huge chunk of NORP, particularly in the South.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithtanehisicoates2", "title": "Interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-ta-nehisi-coates-2", "publication_date": "19-10-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

If you have got those CARDINAL things right - if those CARDINAL things are happening - then a third leg of the stool is, how do we in the NORP community build a culture in which we are saying to our kids, Here is what it takes to succeed. Here is how we support each other. Here is how we look out for each other. And it is my view that if society was doing the right thing with respect to you, programs targeted at helping people rise into the middle class and have a good income and be able to save and send their kids to school, and you have got a vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, then I have confidence in the black community's capabilities to then move forward. Now, does that mean that all vestiges of past discrimination would be eliminated, that the income gap or the wealth gap or the education gap would be erased in DATE or DATE? Probably not, and so this is obviously a discussion we have had before when you talk about something like reparations. Theoretically, you can make, obviously, a powerful argument that DATE of slavery, PERSON, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps. That those were wrongs done to the black community as a whole, and black families specifically, and that in order to close that gap, a society has a moral obligation to make a large, aggressive investment, even if it is not in the form of individual reparations checks, but in the form of a Marshall Plan, in order to close those gaps. It is easy to make that theoretical argument. But as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation's resources over a long period of time to make that right.

You have countries like GPE that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it has not fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it is hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.

Second of all, the NORP American community would not just be wealthier, but it would actually also be more politically empowered by virtue of having more resources. Third, I actually believe that some residue of discrimination would lessen, because it is my view that there is a certain percentage of the white population that stereotypes and makes assumptions about NORP because they do not inject the history of slavery and PERSON into current incarceration rates, or crime rates, or poverty rates, or what have you - but if they started having more middle-class black kids who are friends with their kids, eating Cheerios in their kitchen, their attitudes start changing.

His mother was a drug addict, and his dad is in prison, and he has no sense of direction. And there is no doubt that the more you did for him, probably the better he would do, but what is always striking to me is he just got a little bit.

Were you surprised relatively early on in your presidency when people criticized you for not having a quote-unquote black agenda ? I mean, I think if you worked at the community level in GPE and then a politician on the South Side of GPE, and worked at the state level, then you are pretty familiar with all the variations of politics in the NORP community and criticisms you may get. If you are not familiar with those or you do not have a thick enough skin to take it, then you probably would not have gotten here. So it did not surprise you at all? I think, and look, ENTITY, I do not want to discount those criticisms, but offsetting those criticisms is that I have PERCENT or PERCENT support in the NORP community and it is not sort of Well, he is black, so it is okay. We are not going to say anything even though we are seething. And I hang out with a lot of middle-aged black women, and they are not casual in their support of me. Partly because they understand the constraints of this society. It is one thing if they were watching and we were not working on poverty issues, and we were not working on education issues, and we were not working on health-care issues. You know, they are pretty sophisticated; they understand that I am trying to move an aircraft carrier here, I am not just steering the speedboat. And so part of it is, I think, intellectual, and part of it is obviously emotional as well. PERSON and I have never felt as if, at any stage, folks did not have our backs. And as a consequence, I think that just spurred us on that much more to make us want to do the right thing, and do our best in the positions that we have. So perhaps more substantive than that early-on critique, for instance - and PERSON and I talked a little bit about this - when you attempted to bring in some of the ORG activists and folks refused.

And so the only time I get frustrated with activist criticism is if I have recognized them, and invited them to work with me to figure out how we solve this problem that they are concerned about, and either they do not engage out of the sense of purity - I am not going to shake his hand - or you are not sufficiently prepared so you do not even know what to ask for, or you are not being strategic as an activist and trying to figure out how the process has to work in order for you to get what you want.

So she was one of the organizers of the Ferguson movement, ended up joining our task force. She came in here and she just knew her stuff.

But she was sufficiently well-informed and engaged that it was very easy then to say, You are right about this, you are wrong I think about that, but I am not sure, let us sit down and see if we can hammer out a strategy that we agree with. And by the way, I want you talking to that police chief over there and that sheriff, because I think you might be able to persuade them if we break this down into its component parts. Now, in contrast, there have been times where, let us say on LGBT issues, when we were trying to end Do not Ask, Do not Tell, and I got the ORG and PERSON, a NORP holdover from the PERSON administration, to authorize a study of how you might end Do not Ask, Do not Tell, headed up by PERSON, who at that time was a council to ORG.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithtanehisicoates2", "title": "Interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-ta-nehisi-coates-2", "publication_date": "19-10-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And that sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. No, and the reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt. Because you feel like saying to these folks, you think if I could do it, I have just done it. Do you think that the only problem is that I do not care enough about the plight of poor people, or gay people, or immigrants, or ? But do not they have some level of distrust towards you?

The truth is that this technology really began to take off right at the beginning of my presidency. And it was not until DATE in where I began to realize that the ORG and our national-security apparatus and the ORG were all getting too comfortable with the technology as a tool to fight terrorism, and not being mindful enough about how that technology is being used and the dangers of a form of warfare that is so detached from what is actually happening on the ground. And so we initiated this big process to try to get it in a box, and checks and balances, and much higher standards about when they are used. But the truth is that, in trying to get at terrorists who are in countries that either are unwilling or unable to capture those terrorists or disable them themselves, there are a lot of situations where the use of a drone is going to result in much fewer civilian casualties and much less collateral damage than if I send in a battalion of marines. And I think right now we probably have the balance about right. Now, you would not know that if you talked to ORG or ORG or some of the international activist organizations. Certainly you would not know that if you were talking to some of the writers who criticize our drone policy. But I have actually told my staff it is probably good that they stay critical of this policy, even though I think right now we are doing the best that we can in a dangerous world with terrorists who would gladly blow up a school bus full of NORP kids if they could. But if suddenly all those organizations said, Okay, the ENTITY administration's got it right, and we do not have a problem here, the instinct towards starting to use it more, and then some of those checks and balances that we have built up starting to decay - that is probably what would happen.

Well, let me just say about that that I am hard put to answer a specific question of that kind. the CARDINAL of what we want, the tax reform; the other with the necessity of coming in with the budget. We have been long TIME around that ORG table on the budget matter and, finally, have now submitted it. We have not yet begun that process on the tax program.

Well, the way the ORG proposal lowers individual tax rates is by increasing corporate taxes by PERCENT. Again, as a concept, do you generally favor that approach of individual versus corporate taxes? The corporate tax is given a ceiling of lower than the- Not the rates, but overall corporate taxes would go up PERCENT under the ORG proposal while individual taxes would come down. Is that a general approach that you endorse? I, as I say, I have not even made an attempt to study that bill in detail that much to know that. I assume that that would mean things that would be taken away from them that are present deductions. I would have to be convinced of the need to do that, because I am a believer that one day we must recognize that only people pay taxes. And someday I would hope that we could arrive at a tax structure that would recognize that you cannot tax things; you only tax people. Well, you also said TIME that this was not going to be a tax increase under any disguise. If the bill is modified to meet the objections of some critics, whether it is from the business community or elsewhere, could it be that the bill would be a revenue loser? And would that be acceptable to you? I think what we are talking about here is a tax reform, and you are striving for neutrality in this. Now, in that kind of a reform, I am also sure that there are going to be some people, obviously, who are going to pay more tax than they are paying now. But, then, you are talking about people who are unfairly not paying a share of the tax DATE. And if you-the aim of this kind of a tax program, and I think this is true of all CARDINAL of the proposals that are now before us-the CARDINAL that are up in the ORG now, plus this ORG report-I think it is true that CARDINAL of the targets there is the large amount of tax that is not being paid, many times legally, by virtue of the complexities of the present tax laws, in which some who fairly should be paying a share are avoiding it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgroupseniorexecutivesandstaffmembersfromthewallstreetjournal", "title": "Interview With a Group of Senior Executives and Staff Members From the Wall Street Journal", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-group-senior-executives-and-staff-members-from-the-wall-street-journal", "publication_date": "07-02-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And if it is revenue neutral, it will end up actually providing more revenues from the simple reason that you will broaden the base of the economy. Let me try CARDINAL more tax question, sir. You also spoke favorably about the notion of lowering rates and, as you just said, broadening the base by eliminating many exemptions. But right after you did that, you then called for CARDINAL new exemptions; namely, enterprise zones and tuition tax credits. Does not that just encourage others to try to carve out their own special places for their own pet write-offs and threaten to unravel that whole concept of lowering the base by broadening-or lowering the rates by broadening the base? Well, if you are trying to make a tax program more fair, which is also part of this proposal-take the issue you have raised of tuition tax credits. Here you have, I think, a very broad-based on fairness in the country-you have got people who are compelled to send their children to school under the law, because we believe that a democracy can only exist if you have a literate citizenry. And yet these people who, if they choose or feel they can get a better education for their children, choose a private or parochial school, independent school of some kind, they pay the full cost of sending their child to that school. But at the same time, they are paying the full cost that parents of children are paying-they are paying that in taxes to support the public school system. Now, if you stop and think what the additional cost to public schools would be if suddenly the independent schools closed and all those students were turned over to the educational market-and it would not mean an increase in revenues for public education, because already they are getting the money from those parents-you could see what a burden this would be. Well, it seems to me that it is only fair that some parent-as a matter of fact, the ultimate fairness would be educational vouchers. Does government properly support a school system, or does it provide the funds directly to the students to get an education? They could take that voucher and go where they want, and you put competition back into education.

But I think in many instances, when you sat down with those people and pointed out what the change in rates did, some of their hostility disappeared. I think the most important thing that we are going to face is, once we have settled on and agreed on a package that we believe is fair and is the reform that is needed, is then to make sure there is no misunderstanding or lack of understanding of what it will actually mean to the taxpayer. Basically, we found that the overwhelming majority of people were going to get a sizable decrease in taxes, based roughly on this setup, and that those that were not were going to get an increase were people who, as I say, are not presently paying their fair share.

I believe there will be serious discussions about CARDINAL issues on the economic front, CARDINAL really perhaps for the first time.

For DATE, other nations have asked GPE, for example, to lower the budget deficit. And we are working very hard on that, first through this MONEY deficit reduction program that has now been passed by both Houses of our ORG, then through taking on a health care problem which is the biggest source of our growing deficit. And we need to make sure we are coordinating those policies with things which will produce an overall higher level of growth than we now have. It is a big problem for GPE, because CARDINAL of the new jobs we have created here in DATE have come from increased trade with other nations. The second issue I think that we will discuss and, I hope, make some genuine progress on, creating a more open trading system and increasing the chances that we can successfully conclude GATT by DATE.

And I should say by way of background for the rest of you, the reason the labor standards issue is so big is that there was a report issued in this country DATE that indicated that the Caribbean Basin Initiative of GPE, where we tried to get investment in Caribbean countries and put plants down there, had not led to increasing the per capita incomes of the people working in those businesses; that because the people were so poor, that a lot of the people who had taken the money that ORG had put out had still depressed their wages and increased their profits. So we have given some thought to this labor standards issue here and the environmental issue. So I think if we get those agreements that will help. The second thing that will help is if we have to just make the case, you know. Now when we have an agreement, it is a lot easier to defend the jobs argument. Right now there is a simple argument against NAFTA being waged by, articulated by Mr. PERSON in this country and others, that you cannot make a trade agreement that takes down all the barriers with a country on your border with a per capita income that is CARDINAL as much as yours is.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Well, it has great superficial appeal, but the truth is that anybody who wants to go to GPE and invest their money for low wages can do so DATE. But the market opening measures that have been taken by President PERSON in DATE have led GPE from a MONEY trade deficit to a MONEY trade surplus with GPE. And we are in effect because GPE, as you know, is our biggest trade partner-we are now building this hemispheric economic bloc that we want. And so I think we can refute it on the merits. The third thing we have to do is ask the economists to consider what will happen if we do not pass the trade agreement. Our relationships with GPE are secure, and we have a bilateral agreement, and that is fine. But we could go back in our relationships with GPE, which would mean economic problems for GPE, more trade barriers, fewer jobs in GPE, more illegal immigration. A lot of problems could develop for GPE if we do not do the NAFTA. However, I believe that our goal ought to be to find ways to make preserving the environment good economics. At the Rio conference DATE, GPE, GPE, and many other NORP countries were proving that you could do that because they were down there promoting environmental technology while GPE was trying to stop the environmental agreements. I think that our country was not as wise as many of the nations here represented in the way they approached the Rio conference. We have now signed on, GPE has, to the Biodiversity Treaty. And we have basically adopted a policy of long-term environmental preservation with an aggressive effort to figure out how to make jobs and incomes and prosperity flow out of that. And I believe that there are lots of opportunities to do that. If I might just mention CARDINAL, our bilateral aid package to GPE that is now making its way to the ORG focuses heavily on what we can do with our technology to help them to reduce the problems that their nuclear industry-and not simply their bombs but their nuclear power plants, for example-present to them, and what else we can do in the area of energy and the environment to help to clean up their environment in ways that are good for their economy and good for ours.

That was CARDINAL point that Prime Minister PERSON made to me in our meeting here. And I know it is difficult to lead when you have troubles yourself. All of us have economic troubles. All of us, to a greater or lesser extent, have some political conflict within our countries. But I think that it is very important-and almost to change the atmosphere and the attitudes of the peoples of ORG Yes, we are having economic trouble. And the fact that we are all having it should be some indication that there is some sort of historic change going on here and not that there is some character flaw in our people or some great mental breakdown in our countries or something else. This is a tidal wave of global change going on here. We have innovative work forces; we have great bases of technology; we have an understanding of how the world works economically. And I think we have within our power the means to move forward and break out of this problem we are in but only if we have the courage to keep changing.

It is hard for the wealthy countries to grow wealthier unless the people below us are getting wealthier and can buy more of our products. And so I feel very strongly that we ought to come out of the ORG with a more vigorous commitment to get the GPE round done. Now let me just say what I have done in that regard.

It is far more important than what is in the specific words of the communiqu?, whether we come out of there with some sort of commitment to do something, to take action, and to move. Let me just give you CARDINAL example. I am trying to do something that our country has not done before. We are trying to dramatically cut our Government deficit at a time when our economic growth is slow. Traditional economic theory would say if you have a sluggish economy, you do not cut spending and raise taxes; you might do the reverse, right? Why am I trying to do that? Because we are in a global economy, and the GPE deficit caused an imbalance in the global economy, okay? But now, this can work for us for a while just on our own, because we had so much debt in DATE accumulated at high interest rates, by bringing down the deficit, interest rates in GPE have dropped very low. So businesses and homeowners are going out now and refinancing their debt, and that puts a lot of new money into our economy. So I can get a little bit of growth just on what we do here. But in the end, this will only work if there is an expansionary policy in GPE, if Europe is able to resume a higher level of growth so that the system is brought into balance, because what we do has a complementary action in the rest of the ORG. So these are the things, it seems to me, that really matter. And that is why I think these ORG meetings can really make a difference. But I think that if we get all hung up on-you know, we all have to have these prepared statements, and we are afraid we are going to say CARDINAL word out of the way or make CARDINAL little mistake which makes a huge headline in some country. And then we have got to have every little word right in these communiqu?s.

The other nations of the world have asked GPE for DATE and DATE and DATE internally to do one thing. The only thing they ever asked of us internally was to do something about our budget deficit, which caused a significant imbalance in the global economic relations. I read about it for DATE before I became ORG. And we are doing that, and it is very tough to do in tough economic times.

I am still hopeful that something humane, decent, and politically reasonable will emerge from this process before it is too late. But we all have a disagreement on that, and I am sorry we do.

First of all, the action that was taken on steel was taken after a lot of deliberation, most of which was done before I became ENTITY, subsequent to GPE law, which is clearly GAIT-consistent. So, I think, you know, if the belief is that GPE has been wrong on the facts, then we can discuss the facts. But there is nothing wrong with our law, and it is not that different from the laws of a lot of other countries that are part of the world trading system. Secondly, with regard to the trading mechanism, I have no problem with a multilateral mechanism to enforce trading agreements. But the ORG clearly contemplates that every country in the world, including GPE, should have the right to act in its own interest if the international system breaks down, which is not to say that you lose some rulings. But if there is no resolution of a crisis, the international system breaks down. All our Section 301 trade law does is to provide for some ultimate reservoir of authority for GPE to act unilaterally if the system itself breaks down. If GPE, for example, would like to propose a stronger multilateral decisionmaking process as a part of ORG before any country could act on its own, I would be more than happy to discuss that.

You'd be lucky to get a fraction of those votes DATE for this deal. So what is happened to ORG on this subject? Well, first of all, we do not know how many votes we will get yet, so - so we will wait and take a look. A couple of things have happened. First of all, I think it is important for us to understand that free trade is good for GPE. We have the best workers in the world, the most innovative companies in the world, the best products in the world, the most productive agricultural sector in the world. We want to sell goods made in GPE elsewhere. And PERCENT of the world's market is outside our borders. If we are not selling outside GPE, then we are going to have problems. And we want to make sure that we are not being impeded by a bunch of unfair rules outside of GPE. And I think that back in DATE, when Nafta passed, President PERSON made the right arguments about why it was important. The problem was that, at that time, we did not get some of the protections around labor rights, environmental issues included in the agreement in an enforceable way. When ORG passed, that allowed GPE to come into the world economic system. That was the right thing to do geopolitically - it stitched GPE together with the rest of the world - but GPE was not subject to some of the enforcement mechanisms needed if they manipulated currency or engaged in non-tariff barriers in terms of entering into their market. And so, over the course of DATE, what you saw was trade benefit the GPE economy in the aggregate with cheaper prices, inflation low, the creation of a global supply chain that was good for GPE companies, but what is true, and the best economic data seems to show is that there was some erosion of our manufacturing bases at the time.

And some people have been suspicious, feel burned from some of those experiences. The argument that I have made consistently is that is not a reason for us not to enter into trade agreements anymore, it is a reason for us to strengthen the trade agreements that we do enter into. And that is exactly what we have done with respect to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or ORG. What we are negotiating will be by far the most progressive, high-standard trade agreement in history. If and when this agreement is completed, you are going to have countries who have very low, if any, environmental standards in the past suddenly having obligations to deal with issues like deforestation or dealing with overfishing their waters or pollution or child labor. job training, rebuilding our infrastructure, making sure that we got the best education system in the world, making sure that we are protecting our workers and - and fighting for strong labor rights here in GPE. But what we are not going to do is to reverse the trends of globalization. We have got to be in the game.

So, NORP exports to the rest of Asia have more than doubled since DATE. They are setting up a new infrastructure development bank. They are literally paving roads so that they can export their own goods. Is the GPE losing the economic competition in Asia to GPE right now?

We know that even though gas prices are low right now, over the long term fossil fuels are going to be more expensive. GPE needs to be focused on capturing, you know, the lion's share of the market for fuel-efficient cars. And you know, they worked with us to double fuel-efficiency standards. We like big cars and we like driving long ways and we like cheap gas. And I keep on telling folks, enjoy the fact that gas is cheap right now, but we have got to plan for the future.

ENTITY, let me start my question with your view on GPE. Since you took office you have mentioned GPE several times. At times you were somewhat stem, expressing its remoteness from an open market. At times you were generous for expressing the relationship of the most important bilateral one for GPE. Which of your assessments is true to your feeling? First of all, I probably have more admiration for your country in more ways than any ENTITY who has ever served. I have had the privilege of traveling to GPE many times. I actively sought NORP companies to come to my State when I was a Governor. I believe you have a very great country with an even brighter future than your past.

I think that there are things that we need to do in our trade relationship that will benefit both of us. I do not want to create NORP jobs at the expense of NORP jobs.

If I did not think it was good for both of us, I would not push that. But I think we will work that out. And the main thing I want to say to the people of GPE is that this period of political turmoil is not a bad thing for GPE. I know it is different from what you have experienced in DATE, but GPE has had an astonishing amount of success with the certain political arrangement. But as the global economy changes, as the people of GPE themselves change in their aspirations, the political system will have to alter to reflect that.

I have seen some of the press reports in GPE of some of my statements as if I want to protect NORP jobs and take NORP jobs away. It is far more complex than that. I think that both of us have to undergo changes. Every nation represented in this circle, with the possible exception of GPE, has hounded GPE, has asked GPE for DATE to do something about our big Government deficit, saying that that caused a big imbalance in global trade.

There is an impression that the indecisive way in which you have handled this issue is an illustration of the widening gap of trust between GPE and Europe. You advocated lifting the arms embargo on the NORP and striking at some NORP positions. And then you appeared to back away from that. Then you moved to a compromise plan for setting up safe havens. Now, that is a concept which you, yourself, described as a shooting gallery. Are you preparing now to wash your hands of this whole affair and possibly to blame the NORP for the failure?

We spent a great deal of money on humanitarian aid; we have pushed hard for strengthening the embargo against GPE; we have pushed for a number of other things to try to help resolve the situation that we have all agreed on. I did not back away from my position, sir. GPE and GPE and GPE said they would not support that position within ORG. GPE cannot act alone under international law in this instance.

ORG agreed with the position I took. But it was an honest disagreement within the most complicated foreign policy problem that any of us have faced in DATE. I do not seek to place blame anywhere.

I voted with many of the nonaligned nations in ORG, and we did not win the battle.

We do not want to say, 'Well, we did not get our way; so we are going to go home.' We will work with you. What can we agree on? They proposed a course that we then embarked on, and they agreed not to totally rule out lifting the arms embargo at a later date.

I mean, one of the things that really bothers me about some of these meetings in the past is that we have all been so afraid of making a mistake, that we have all of our aides around, and we have got everything written down on paper. And if you spend all your time trying to avoid making a mistake, it is hard to make anything good happen. And so one of the things that I am really working for at ORG is a totally open framework where we can honestly share with each other what we feel and how we can resolve this. GPE, if I might say, GPE has 'had some truly astonishing economic accomplishments in DATE, DATE in which the productivity growth in GPE was higher than any other NORP country and higher than GPE growth.

And I realize how hard it is in GPE or in any other country with a high unemployment rate to conduct a trade agreement, because people are afraid of change. But when you are in trouble, that is when you need to change. Sir, you have been elected to put GPE back to work. Do you think GPE has a leadership responsibility in helping the world economy get back to work? And I do not believe that NORP can go back to work in sufficient numbers until the world begins to work more. For example, we have created in this country in DATE CARDINAL 000 jobs. That is about the same number we created in DATE. In DATE, CARDINAL of our jobs have come from exports, CARDINAL.

With regard to GPE, I frankly just disagree with you about that. I think GPE, under my predecessor-I cannot take credit for it-he led the way for a multinational coalition to go into GPE. We saved CARDINAL of lives. We restored order. Children can go to school again. Now, GPE did not have the infrastructure of a nation. PERSON presented us a problem. We did our best to break the back of his military capacity to disrupt GPE without appearing to go after him personally. I would like it if he were arrested but without trying to just take him out personally. I think we are on the right path in GPE, but we have to have patience in nation-building. With regard to GPE, the action I took in GPE was specifically designed to respond to the attempt to assassinate President PERSON. There are a whole set of other issues which have to do with GPE's defiance of the ORG resolutions. ORG issued a very stern warning to GPE, and I think there will either be more compliance or some sort of appropriate action. But again, I would say to you if you look at GPE and you say we did not solve that, it seems to me that the west did the right thing in not being obsessed with deposing PERSON. We acted against him because he invaded GPE. So he was removed from GPE and has been confined in a lot of the mischief he might have otherwise have wreaked. So I do not know if you can tout that as a failure. GPE is a disappointment, but it is the most difficult problem, not only in Europe but in the world. We have honest disagreements among ourselves. I still have every hope that something can be done. And I have said repeatedly that GPE would be prepared to contribute to a genuine effort to maintain the peace if an agreement can be signed. I had thought, as you know, that lifting the arms embargo would accelerate movement to a genuine peace. I still believe that. That is the way it is in the world we are living in.

I do not think I should involve myself too much in the internal politics of GPE over this issue except to say that as ENTITY I am profoundly grateful for the position that Chancellor PERSON has taken on these issues and the willingness of the NORP people to support involvement in GPE, to try to help insofar as they could in GPE.

We also are exploring other options for compliance that would not delay the treaty, and we are proceeding full-speed ahead. But the irony of this is that, as you know, this administration has taken some extra time with ORG to try to conclude environmental agreements that would make it absolutely clear that the NAFTA agreement would improve the environment on both sides of the border. So this is a delaying tactic but does not square with the facts. ORG will help us to improve the environment on both sides of the border. That is what we are negotiating so hard with the NORP on, and the NORP have been supportive of the idea that we ought to try to make sure that there is no environmental degradation.

Obviously, if we can get all of our people in completely and then get them properly dispersed around the country, we will be able to provide a far higher level of protection. And for those people who lose their homes, they are entitled to have them rebuilt, along with everybody else, and I intend to do that. ENTITY, you covered the waterfront on domestic issues you think are very important. And I understand there is a report in ORG, already in second draft, and it is supposed to be a political hot potato, and therefore you are hesitant to make it public. There is a draft of a book that I wanted to produce and asked for help on from PERSON and from others on our staff and not on our staff DATE. And PERSON gave me his draft; then the staff looked at it and talked about where it was and was not consistent with present policies we were pursuing. They gave it all to me. I was involved for DATE with the conflict in GPE. And what has really happened is that I want to do this right. I think all of you know how important this whole race issue is to me, and it is been amplified in its potential future importance because of the problems that we see involving race and ethnic and religious problems around the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1065", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1065", "publication_date": "25-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

So you should not draw any conclusions other than that I want to be personally involved in it and I simply have not had the time to give it the effort that it deserves. Is it based on the panel's hearings and so forth? It is based on the panel's hearings; it is based on very long conversations I had with the people that worked on the draft for me, with Mr. PERSON and PERSON and others. We had some long, long sessions. I went through everything I wanted in the book. I went through some things I wanted to emphasize more than were emphasized in DATE that the panel was publicly meeting we were having the race dialogs. But I think it is very important, but it is got to be, first of all, mine. It is got to reflect what I believe and where I think we need to go. And secondly, it needs to move the ball forward a little bit. Those of you who covered the speech TIME at ORG will remember that the young woman from GPE who introduced me talked about how the initiative on race got her involved in something in her local community. Another CARDINAL of the Presidential scholars, when she walked by me TIME, said, I want to know how I can get involved. I am still interested in this. So I think there is still a great deal of interest in this in the country and maybe especially among our younger people. So you should not yes, there are some differences of opinion among the people who had input in it, but that is not what is caused us not to put it out. What is caused us not to put it out is that I have not had the time to give to it, to be very careful and relaxed and thoughtful about how I say what it is I want to say to the country about this. ENTITY, TIME and again just now, you made references to DATE of progress, and you were calling for bipartisanship to try to accomplish things in DATE.

{"id": 3714, "text": "Well, for CARDINAL thing, I think it would be to everyone's advantage to continue to make progress. As I always tell the NORP and NORP, no matter how much we do, there will still be plenty of things on which there is honest disagreement, over which the next election can be fought. That is just in the nature of things. That is healthy; that is good; that is a CARDINAL-party system in GPE. But we are all hired by the NORP people to work here day-in and day-out, DATE-in and week-out, and we make a grave mistake and it is almost never good politics to do the wrong thing, that is, to take a pass on making progress when you can do it. This is a very unusual moment where we have sustained prosperity, the longest peacetime expansion in our history. We have gone from having the biggest deficits in history to having the biggest surpluses in history. And yet, we have these looming demographic challenges of ORG and ORG. And we have these big issues that are right before us now, the ones I mentioned on which there is basically broad agreement. So I think that it would be good for GPE and, therefore, good for everyone involved if we go ahead and do this. I think, obviously, the closer you get to the election, perhaps the more difficult it will be. But I expect I will make you a prediction here I expect that we will get some good things done in DATE, before the ORG recesses finally for the election then. I expect to keep working right up to the very end, and I think that we will continue to make progress. But the most important thing is the attitude of the main players in ORG, insofar as ORG has to play a role in this. ORG, in the wake of GPE Congressman PERSON's study of spying in the GPE and, specifically, NORP attempts to spy, you asked your ORG to look into this, and it came back with a central recommendation that you separate the Nation's nuclear labs from ORG. Your ORG Secretary seems to be resisting that. Do you still maintain that you were not told anything about these NORP efforts to spy at the ORG's nuclear labs during your administration, sir? Let us go back to the first question there are CARDINAL separate questions.

{"id": 3715, "text": "I thought it was quite interesting and had a lot of very helpful analyses of how this problem developed. either that the labs could be put under an independent board, or that the labs should be taken out of the present hierarchy of organization because of the culture the committee the PERSON-man group talked a lot about the culture of the labs and its resistance to oversight. He said another alternative might be to take it out from under the present organizational structure and make it directly answerable the labs directly answerable to ORG. And he posed those things in the alternative. I have asked our people to look at it. I have talked to Secretary PERSON about it. I think everyone recognizes that he has worked very hard to deal with the underlying security issues, which are the most important things. And I think we all just ought to try to get together and work out what the best organizational structure is, and I expect that we will be I expect to have a chance to talk to him about that and to work on it. But I think the PERSON report was a service to the country, and I think that PERSON is doing a good job on trying to implement the security measures that are necessary. Now, on the second question, I went back I have been interested in this question, and I went back and looked at exactly what I said. And what I said was that I did not suspect that any actual breaches of security had occurred during my tenure. Since then, we have learned of the offloading of the computer by Mr. PERSON, from the secured computers into his personal computers. That is something we know now that I did not know then. But I think my choice of wording was poor. What I should have said was I did not know of any specific instance of espionage, because I think that we have been suspicious all along. And I have to acknowledge, I think, I used a poor word there. We did not have any specific instance, as we now do, of the offloading of the computer. But I also want to emphasize that I took no particular comfort in that, because what we have here is what I learned in DATE was that there was a general problem of very long standing with the security at the labs, and I issued the Executive order in DATE to clean it up.

{"id": 3716, "text": "Sir, I'd like to ask you about ORG and your plans that you are going to be announcing DATE. This is a program that CARDINAL of NORP depend on, and yet in DATE it will be effectively bankrupt. And you are about to propose what could be a very costly additional benefit in the prescription benefit. Why are you going to do that, sir? For CARDINAL thing let me remind you that we have taken a lot of very tough positions to reform ORG since DATE. When I took office, ORG was supposed to go broke DATE. So we have taken a lot of important positions already. And as a matter of fact, as I am sure you are all aware, a lot of the health care providers, particularly rural hospitals, nursing homes, home health providers, a disproportionate share of hospitals for the folks listening to us, that is basically inner-city hospitals and teaching hospitals that have a whole lot of poor folks they take care of who are not reimbursed a lot of those people believe that our savings are too great. But we have taken some very tough actions to try to lengthen the life of ORG. When I make my proposals on DATE, there will be more to lengthen the life further, to make sure that we get through DATE and maybe more of DATE with ORG alive and well. But if you look at the long run, I think it is important that we propose a prescription drug benefit because life expectancy is going up. Drugs are being constantly developed which help to improve the quality as well as the length of life, and if they are properly taken, they can actually reduce long-term hospitalization and other medical costs. Now, it is absolutely true that if we design this wrong, it could wind up being a lot more expensive than rosy scenario suggests. But if you look at my record here over DATE, I have tried to be quite conservative in my budget projections and quite responsible in handling the budget of the country. And you will see that, I think, reflected in the way I make this proposal, including the prescription drugs. You have got CARDINAL NORP, seniors, out there without any kind of coverage for their medicine. You have got CARDINAL of others with inadequate or highly expensive coverage.

{"id": 3717, "text": "And I believe that over the long run, the proper availability, properly priced, of prescription medicine will actually not only lengthen lives and improve the quality of life of our seniors and improve their security, their state of mind, but it will also, long, long-term, save medical costs because it will keep people out of hospitals and out of more expensive treatments. What is your strategy now, ENTITY, for a comprehensive campaign finance reform, to really make it pass? Well, I think the best strategy is to get a clear majority of ORG to demand that it come up and then try to put enough pressure on to get the ORG leaders to let it come up. Basically, the NORP leadership in the ORG has said that they are just not going to permit it to come up, because they do not want their people who would vote against it to have a recorded vote on it and they do not want to run the risk that they have got enough for their folks that would vote with all of ours. See, all of our people are for it. We have got PERCENT of the NORP in the ORG for it. And so, what I think we have to do is to keep it on the front burner enough so that the discomfort level rises high enough that an actual vote is allowed. If we'd just get a vote on the bill, I will be very well satisfied, and I think it will come out just fine. Can I ask a political question? When Vice President PERSON announced officially for President, he chose a date when you were going to be out of the country. And according to Mrs. PERSON's supporters, if she announces her exploratory committee in DATE, it would be at a time when you have got a commitment to go out to GPE. Do you think your personal behavior has made you something of a liability to those who are running? And did you take it personally when Vice President PERSON made his announcement and seemed to set himself so clearly separate from you when it came to issues of family? Well, first of all, I thought, as I have said repeatedly, I thought the Vice President had a great announcement.

{"id": 3718, "text": "What he said in his announcement was that he had had more experience than anybody running, which is true; that he would put forward more specific ideas about what he would do if he were elected President than anyone has to date, by far, which is true; and that the choice before the NORP people was whether we would build on the progress that we have made for DATE or turn around and go backwards, which is what I think the real choice will be before the NORP people. So I approved of that. And as far as his doing it when I was out of the country, I thought that was a good thing. Very often, you'd be amazed how many times over DATE we have planned for certain announcements to be made by the Vice President when I was out of the country, because that way it gets I mean, far be it for us to try to maneuver the press but he gets better coverage, and I get better coverage I am out of the country, so he gets better coverage. And I think on the general point, what I have noticed over now more than DATE, since I first began to volunteer as a young man in politics, all politics, all elections are about the future, and all candidates are judged on their own merits. But I think that the NORP people know that the country's in good shape and that not only our economic policies, our crime policies, and our welfare policies, but our family policies are good for their efforts to raise their children. And the best thing that I can do, it seems to me, is to do the right thing by my country, to just keep working at being a good ENTITY, and they will do fine. Not be with Mrs. PERSON when she campaigns? Well, first of all, she has not made a decision to announce to run for the ORG.

And I think I was asked this question earlier in a slightly different question I think that the first and most important thing is for us to get the whole ORG force in there, all CARDINAL, as quickly as possible, properly deployed to maximize security. Then I think we have got to get people busy doing positive things, rebuilding their homes, reestablishing their property records, reestablishing their schools. We have got to give them something to think about on a daily basis that is positive. Then I strongly believe we need to give them the help they need to try to work through this emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, morally. I think a lot of these children are going to need mental health services, and I hope we can get them. I think that we need to bring people in who have been through similar things. I had a long talk with PERSON about this after he came back. He went over and toured the camps for me and talked to the people. I think that there are people who've been through the Holocaust who can help a lot. I think there are people who have been through GPE and the peace and reconciliation commission and DATE of what those people went through there who can help a lot. I think we need to be quite imaginative about once we get the building blocks of security and the building blocks of reconstruction in place and the building blocks of civil society in place, then I think we need to be quite imaginative about the human, spiritual dimension of this. And I will do my best to be supportive. I have talked to Reverend PERSON about this, about the importance of bringing in religious leaders from all the not only from the NORP and the NORP faiths to come and work together and work people through this but perhaps others as well.

Is not there any way that we can design a national program to educate people ? On the to go to your point when PERSON and I decided that we ought to have this grassroots campaign to try to protect children against violence and we began to talk to PERSON, who started the ORG movement in GPE, and others, one of the things that we learned, obviously, is that a lot of young people wind up being especially really troubled young people can often be almost strangers in their own homes. And we assume that people ought to just know how to do the most important jobs in life, and they are very often reluctant to ask for help. But I think one of the things that we have to try to do is to develop the kind of supports parents need to do a better job. And it is a much harder job now than it used to be, especially since the average parent is away from his or her children for TIME a week more than was the case DATE. So I do think that we need to do some more. Most parents, however, want to do a good job, really, really want to do a good job. And I think when you start with that, one of the things that I hope very much will come out of this whole movement against teen violence is more efforts in that regard.
