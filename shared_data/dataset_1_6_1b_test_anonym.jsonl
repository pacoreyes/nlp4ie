We must use technology and be wise about how we use technology, to speed the flow of commerce across our borders and to identify frequent travelers who pose no risk. We should be directing resources to risk. We ought to be routing out smugglers and focusing on criminals and, of course, stopping terrorists from coming into the country.

It makes it easier for the ORG and other Federal agencies to get better information about people and products that come into GPE.

I tried to change the disparities, and ORG was willing to narrow, but not eliminate, them on the theory that people who use crack are more violent than people who use cocaine. Well, what they really meant was that people who use crack are more likely to be poor and, coincidentally, black or brown and, therefore, not have money. Whereas, people who use cocaine were more likely to be rich, pay for it, and therefore be peaceable. But my own view is, if you do something violent, it is appropriate to have an incarceration.

This can be done through tax credits to encourage the weatherization of homes, the installation of devices like thermostats, that are timed by DATE, to prevent excessive air conditioning or heating loads when they are not needed, because somebody might be absent-minded and not change the thermostat when they could have changed it, and of course, the installation of solar heating devices of all kinds.

Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what is necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member. And that is where ORG comes in, because it is able to, in very concrete terms, help to generate people's energy and mobilize their interest around these issues in ways that are not abstract, but are very concrete and very specific and that reach people where they live, at the kitchen table, and at the water cooler at work.

So I just want to say to all of you, what you are doing is really important, and we really appreciate it. It is often at the ground level, but it makes a difference. And CARDINAL final example of that difference that is being made is when it comes to the Affordable Care Act.

We are ready to go all the way on the elimination of nuclear weapons. But I did not get an answer.

Would it be wise to try to achieve that sort of interim agreement about the time when the SALT II limitations would have expired, that have been generally observed by both sides? Oh, I have not really thought about whether that makes any difference or not.

And yet, after we spent a brief period of time, we both came to realize, we share the same concerns, particularly for the poor, and we both represent big, influential nations; and that we can work together to achieve common objectives. And CARDINAL such objective is human rights and rule of law, a civil society that empowers individuals; that we believe government ought to respond to people and that people ought to have the ultimate say in the fate of government. We came from different political directions-I readily concede-but nevertheless, when we listened carefully, we found common ground. And that puts us in a position where we can work in practical ways to address significant problems. CARDINAL such problem is trade, and President PERSON and I will spend time on the GPE round to determine whether or not we are able to advance GPE in a constructive way that benefits our nations and, equally importantly, the world's poor. The best way to alleviate poverty is for there to be prosperity, and CARDINAL way to enhance prosperity is through a world that trades freely and fairly. The other area-another area of common ground is changing our energy uses. My last trip to GPE, I was briefed extensively on GPE's capacity to use its raw materials to develop a vast ethanol industry.

So I now return to GPE with a robust domestic agenda on ethanol. We had already had an agenda on ethanol, but it is now even more robust as a result of a mandatory fuel standard I laid out that said, GPE will be consuming QUANTITY of ethanol.

I am wondering whether you have ever talked with him about this, and is this just a fundamental disagreement between the CARDINAL of you? You know, I have not had a conversation with Governor PERSON. I know that part of his concern was prompted by some bad experiences with charters in GPE that were not up to snuff.

My goal here is to create laboratories of innovation so that in the public school system, we are on a race to the top as opposed to stuck in the old ways of doing things. And we have got to; we have got to do that. In your home town of GPE, I do not know off the top of my head what the dropout rate is, but I have got to assume that it is hovering PERCENT.

So the trick is-that also, by the way, would foreclose-this is what happened to me when I got in. I did not have the option to do what NORP would normally-the Government would normally do in a recession, which is to have a substantial tax cut and pump the thing back up, because the deficit was so big, it would just have caused interest rates to skyrocket.

First, I do believe in the new economy. I think that technology is rifling through every sector of economic activity, in ways that have given us dramatic increases in productivity and potential for growth without inflation that I think most models have not accurately measured. And I think that, therefore, the most important thing for Government policy is to be fiscally responsible, to create the conditions in which people can prosper, and then to try to do things which will accelerate the trends that are already underway.

They are more destabilizing than the people's concern about weapons that we are familiar with-airplanes, battleships, things of this kind, artillery.

ENTITY, since we have already touched on the question of nuclear weapons, I would not like to seem pessimistic, but I get the impression that in GPE there will hardly be an opportunity to sign a treaty about PERCENT reductions of strategic nuclear weapons while observing the ABM treaty. Still, despite that, what are your attitudes about the prospects of concluding such a very, very important treaty for the world? Well, I still think it can be concluded, but it would be, I think, overly optimistic, with the time limitations, to believe that it could be ready for signature as the INF treaty was here in the previous meeting. It would be nice if we could have achieved a signing ceremony there on this visit, but this treaty is far more technical and complicated than the treaty we did sign.

You know, it is not fashionable to stick up for the poor anymore, but those kids are going to grow up and be part of our country. Why do you think the GPE health care system's in trouble? Because they have got a lot of poor kids to care for. Now, we need to slow the growth of both those programs. They have been growing too fast, and they are crowding out our ability to invest in education and technology and the future. Everybody knows it. And we need to make sure that the so-called ORG that guarantees hospital care for the elderly is secure. And everybody knows that.

We can and must expand civilian research and technology. CARDINAL of the great bottlenecks for this country's economic growth in DATE will be the shortage of doctorates in mathematics, engineering, and physics; a serious shortage with a great demand and an under-supply of highly trained manpower. We can and must step up the development of our natural resources. But the most direct and significant kind of ORG action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in private consumption and investment demand to cut the fetters which hold back private spending. In the past, this could be done in part by the increased use of credit and monetary tools, but our balance of payments situation today places limits on our use of those tools for expansion. It could also be done by increasing ORG expenditures more rapidly than necessary, but such a course would soon demoralize both the Government and our economy. If Government is to retain the confidence of the people, it must not spend more than can be justified on grounds of national need or spent with maximum efficiency. I shall say more on this in a moment. The final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this administration pledged itself DATE to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in DATE. I am not talking about a quickie or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent.

I am talking about the accumulated evidence of DATE that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking. In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, ORG most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressandquestionandanswerperiodtheeconomicclubnewyork", "title": "Address and Question and Answer Period at the Economic Club of New York.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-and-question-and-answer-period-the-economic-club-new-york", "publication_date": "14-12-1962", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

And by the way, that is a- the second election was a really important moment in the liberty movement. And I thanked him for that, genuinely so. I thank him for that. GPE serves as a great example of what is possible. After DATE of being subjugated to harsh rule, the NORP are now free, and they are showing they can grow the economy and that people have a chance to express themselves and there is a vibrant society when you are free. And it has been hard; the transition from communism to a free democracy is a hard transition. And it is very important for the NORP and the ORG to share that experience with others who will be going through the same thing. And so I am very proud of GPE, and I am proud to call her friend. ENTITY, you showed a strong support for democracy cause in GPE. And what is your administration planning to do, given the fact that GPE Presidential election is planned DATE? Well, first of all, we will work with you, countries in the neighborhood, countries around-the free countries of the world, to insist there be free elections and make sure there is free elections. This is the last remaining dictatorship in Europe. And PERSON was in the neighborhood recently, as you know, Secretary of ORG PERSON, and she brought up the subject. She met with people who are embracing the freedom movement in GPE. I did as well, when I was in GPE. And so CARDINAL of the roles that GPE can play is to speak clearly about the need for GPE to be free and to work with people to insist that GPE be free and, when the elections come, make sure the elections are free and have monitors and international observers. As you know, that made a big difference in the GPE, for example. No, it is -and I think-listen, I believe everybody wants to be free, and I believe if the world works together to achieve that, many people will be free. GPE is taking a concrete role in the reconstructing of GPE.

Well, look, I think that the challenge that GPE faces from this group is a serious one, and there are all sorts of issues that she and others have identified that make the challenge even greater and that we try to address as a friend of GPE in the assistance that we provide. That is why we provide security assistance, to increase GPE's capacity to meet the threat, including by helping professionalize its military and helping it carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.

Already we have taken a number of actions. We have formed an interagency drought policy committee to coordinate ORG action. ORG is working hard to keep traffic moving on the Mississippi River and elsewhere in spite of some of the lowest water levels in history.

No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops. Fourth, drought relief spending has to be considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the ORG deficit; and according to the DATE bipartisan budget agreement that we reached with ORG, to put it very simply, we mustn't bust the budget.

If these threats can be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be no doubt that GPE can and will do what it must to protect our security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture. Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation. But none of these proposals that I have outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well. When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I am not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, NORP and NORP, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our CARDINAL countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we will also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life. We have made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the NORP side about SALT and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the NORP are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides.

ENTITY, you have been urging ORG to report out on the Sinai agreements by DATE. The problem there is that the CARDINAL parties GPE and GPE had agreed by, I think, DATE to sign the necessary documents and start the implementation of the withdrawal and the change of lines and so forth. GPE has said that it will not start the implementation until the ORG approves the utilization of CARDINAL NORP technicians.

What do you see in the future for getting it straightened out so that we can look at it as a hopeful sign? We have had too many plant cancellations of nuclear power in DATE very few if any for safety reasons, most of them for financing reasons.

I am following around one of your newest-well, not your newest rivals but CARDINAL of the newest candidates for President on the NORP side, PERSON. So let me begin by asking you about your speech on DATE concerning the 50th anniversary of ORG. How do you plan to outline ways for the ORG to reconstitute itself for DATE? Well, I think we have to, first of all, recognize that-I think there are CARDINAL fundamental realities we have to recognize. Number CARDINAL is that the end of the cold war gives the ORG the possibility of living up to the dreams of its founders in ways that were simply impossible when the world was divided into CARDINAL large blocs. And so I think there should be a lot of hope about the ORG The second thing I think we have to recognize is that in order for that hope to be realized, the ORG has got to be properly run and, in particular, the peacekeeping operations have to be properly run. And GPE has spent a lot of time, because we pay a lot of the costs of the ORG, analyzing how the overall operations can be more efficient and cost-effective and inspire more confidence in the countries that are paying the bills and, in particular, looking at the peacekeeping operations and setting up systems to make sure that we use peacekeeping when it will work, that we restrain it when the situation is not right, and that the command-and-control operations are absolutely clear, that we do not have any kind of mixed signals and crossed lines that have sometimes happened in the past. And then when you look ahead into the future, I think it is clear that the new problems of DATE are likely to be rooted in ethnic, religious, and other internal problems within countries and across borders; dealing with or helping to avoid natural disasters that are brought on by a combination of population explosion and natural problems like the inability to produce food; and the rise of terrorism and the danger of proliferation of biological, chemical, and small-scale nuclear weapons.

He expressed his interest in so much that is going on in the world and some of the things that we are trying to do. But also we were so grateful for the opportunity to see him and have this meeting with him. They had arranged a little prayer service in his chapel, but not with him present. But we then went to his room, and he concluded the service before our visit with the final prayer. Senator PERSON of GPE and many others have been very forceful in their language calling for Mr. PERSON to resign. What are your views about that? Well, first of all, I think Mr. PERSON has done a very capable job as Secretary of ORG. I think we have to point out with all of this that it was an unfortunate remark. He has apologized not only to me, but he is apologized to the people on the ORG for that. But I think in all fairness we have to recognize that, yes, it was a very improper thing to say, but it certainly was not said in the sense of any bitterness or bigotry or prejudice.

How comfortable are you with the prospect that your role may be shaping up more and more to be a blocker of action rather than an initiator? Well, I do not want to block action. I have offered even more spending cuts than is in their bill. This is not about cutting spending, and they know it. I worked in good faith with the NORP majority in the ORG to shape a rescission bill that would be better for the NORP people and would still cut spending. For example, I worked with the ORG to add back some of the money in the ORG program, which goes to GPE like GPE to help older people with their utility bills, but we cut spending somewhere else. So we had an agreement that I would go along with this bill, and we worked in good faith. Then the ORG and the ORG Members went behind closed doors when nobody was looking and remember, this is not a partisan issue members of both parties put a lot of pork in the bill and took MONEY in education funding out. And so let me just finish so all I told them was, I am all for it, cutting this much spending. Indeed, I think we should cut a little more spending. I offered another MONEY in spending cuts. But I do not believe if we are going to balance this budget and cut back on Government spending, then we need to be very careful about how we spend the money we do spend. We ought to target it to education. We ought to target it to things that will raise incomes and grow jobs in GPE and improve the security of the NORP people.

And so the NORP people, as well, have begun to get kind of a different perspective on the great contributions that GPE can not only make to our own country but can make to the world.

The book tells mothers and fathers how to rehearse with their children what to say or do if they ever feel threatened. It is a practical guide to explain to children how to deal with predators that are smooth and seductive, how to deal with somebody that is a stranger that sounds sweet-talking but may in their heart be dark and dangerous for our children. The book also lists web sites that provide information about protecting children. Parents need to pay as much attention to their children, by the way, when they are on the Internet as when they are on a playground. They have got to know what their children are doing on the Internet. They have got to know with whom they are conversing. We are passing it out to the Nation's schools, and the schools will then make it available to parents.

If you are interested, if you want a practical go-by, call up ORG on the Internet, and you will get some practical steps as to how to help your children avoid danger.

In your vision, can you foresee a day when there would be free travel of people across the borders without identity cards, just free movement of people in North America? That is probably down the road.

The alternative that has been presented by some is, well, we should just maintain sanctions and keep squeezing GPE and eventually we will get a better deal. That better deal has typically been defined as GPE not just giving up a nuclear weapons program, but giving up any sort of nuclear program, peaceful or otherwise. And what I have said, which I think has been confirmed by every expert on GPE, but also the international community, is that GPE would never agree to what they would consider a complete capitulation.

It cannot halt a strike, and manifestly ORG deliberately omitted the enactment of compulsory arbitration.

I submitted to the officials of the striking employees and the chairman of ORG, in writing, on DATE, a tentative proposal for settlement.

The barrier to be surmounted was the question of seniority. By the workmen these rights are held to be sacred, and unsurrendered by a strike. By the carriers the preservation of seniority is the weapon of discipline on the CARDINAL hand and the reward of faithful employees on the other. In the tentative proposal which I sponsored it was provided that everybody should go to work, with seniority rights unimpaired, that there should be no discrimination by either workmen or carriers against workmen who did or did not strike. I realized that the proposal must carry a disappointment to employees who had inherited promotion by staying loyally on the job, and to such new men as had sought jobs looking to permanent employment, but I wanted the fresh start and maintained transportation service, and I appraised the disappointment of the few to be less important than the impending misfortune to the nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

Statutes which the ORG enacts are set aside or suspended for long periods of time, even in cases to which the ORG is not a party. In the uncertain state of the law, it is not difficult for the ingenious to devise novel reasons for attacking the validity of new legislation or its application. While these questions are laboriously brought to issue and debated through a series of courts, the Government must stand aside. It matters not that the ORG has enacted the law, that the ORG has signed it and that the administrative machinery is waiting to function. Government by injunction lays a heavy hand upon normal processes; and no important statute can take effect against any individual or organization with the means to employ lawyers and engage in wide flung litigation until it has. Thus the judiciary, by postponing the effective date of Acts of the ORG, is assuming an additional function and is coming more and more to constitute a scattered, loosely organized and slowly operating third house of ORG. This state of affairs has come upon the nation gradually over a period of DATE. In my DATE message to this ORG I expressed some views and some hopes. Now, as an immediate step, I recommend that the ORG provide that no decision, injunction, judgment or decree on any constitutional question be promulgated by any federal court without previous and ample notice to the Attorney General and an opportunity for GPE to present evidence and be heard. This is to prevent court action on the constitutionality of Acts of the Congress in suits between private individuals, where the Government is not a party to the suit, without giving opportunity to ORG to defend the law of the land. That sounds like common sense. I also earnestly recommend that in cases in which any court of first instance That is ORG determines a question of constitutionality, the ORG provide that there shall be a direct and immediate appeal to ORG It does not take away any right of any lower court to pass on constitutionality, but it provides for an immediate appeal to ORG, and that such cases take precedence over all other matters pending in that court.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressconference22", "title": "Press Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-conference-22", "publication_date": "05-02-1937", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

The big debates, the big changes that we had historically around everything from establishing public schools to the moon launch to ORG, they were not subject to the filibuster.

We are making significant cuts in procurement, MONEY that we have identified by making sure that we are not engaging in the same no-bid contracting that has been such a problem. In fact, if you look at the trajectory of our nondefense discretionary spending, which is what usually people think about when they think about whether a budget is loaded up with a bunch of nonessential spending, following our budget, we would drive nondefense discretionary spending down to the lowest levels since they started keeping records back in DATE, much lower as a percentage of GDP than it was under PERSON or under PERSON.

This has implications for our efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed GPE. we will not allow GPE to acquire a nuclear weapon. With allies and partners, we continue to pursue a comprehensive strategy to prevent GPE from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including diplomacy, pressure, and increasing sanctions. And, as the President has said, all options remain on the table. For our efforts to succeed, however, the leaders in GPE must know that GPE means what we say. If we do not respond when GPE's close ally, GPE, uses weapons of mass destruction, what message does that send to GPE? It risks suggesting that the international community cannot muster the will to act when necessary. It risks suggesting that serious threats to regional and global stability will be left to fester. It risks suggesting that egregious violations of international norms do not have consequences. Make no mistake, the decision our nation makes in DATE is being watched in capitals around the world, especially in GPE and GPE. They are watching to see whether GPE will stand up for the world we are trying to build for our children and future generations. And, if we fail to act, they will be emboldened to push harder for the world that only they want-a future where more of the world's most dangerous weapons fall into the most dangerous hands. That is not the Middle East or the world that we seek. On the contrary, we seek a Middle East where NORP and NORP live in CARDINAL states, side by side, in peace and security.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

I will feel very confident about being able to put my record before the NORP people and saying that GPE is safer, stronger and better positioned to win the future than it was when I came into office. And there are going to be some issues where people may have some legitimate differences, and there are going to be some serious debates, just because they are hard issues. But overall, I think it is going to be pretty hard to argue that we have not executed a strategy over DATE that has put GPE in a stronger position than it was when I came into office. PERSON says if you are re-elected, GPE will get a nuclear weapon, and if he is elected, it will not . If you are re-elected, GPE will not get a nuclear weapon?

We have a lot of interchange between our countries, with business as well as travel. And there are CARDINAL of NORP who will be pleased, Mr. President, to know we have got good relations. Secondly, we just had a really around-the-world trip as we discussed problem areas and our mutual desire to work together to help solve those problems. We discussed GPE, GPE, GPE. I briefed the President on the recent Annapolis Conference that we hosted to help get the peace process started between the NORP and NORP. We had a very compatible relation discussion because by and large, we are in agreement on how to advance the solutions to these issues. And finally, I am have expressed and will continue to dialog with the President about my deep concern about GPE. GPE we believe GPE had a secret military weapons program. And GPE must explain to the world why they had a program. GPE has an obligation to explain to the ORG why they hid this program from them. GPE is dangerous, and they will be even more dangerous if they learn how to enrich uranium. And so I look forward to working with the President to explain our strategy and figure out ways we can work together to prevent this from happening for the sake of world peace. So I am sure proud to have you here, Mr. President, and welcome. It has been a great pleasure for me to accept your invitation. You kindly addressed me DATE when you were in GPE, and we had already then very positive talks. First of all, I wanted to express to President PERSON my deep appreciation for the responsibility he wanted to take to foster negotiations between GPE and the NORP authorities in view of a peace treaty. GPE is present in several areas of crisis. In this moment, it is an NORP general who is taking the command of the GPE region in GPE. In GPE, we give our contribution to the stabilization of the country, participating in ORG training activities.

GPE is already in flagrant violation of its international obligations. It is engaged in the development of nuclear weapons. It is engaged in development of missile technology that is in contradiction to its commitments. And that is why you see the international response that you have seen. And we will continue to work with our allies in GPE and GPE, as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon GPE to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to GPE. There is an opportunity for GPE to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for GPE, and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that GPE takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with NORP. The NORP people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The NORP people expect their leaders in GPE to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for GPE's children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future.

This is an all-NORP event, because this problem affects all of GPE-every man, woman, and child. Originally, of course, tort law protected innocent people against wrongful damage or injury. Rooted in DATE, tort law became especially important at the onset of the Industrial Revolution, when ordinary men and women began to find themselves presented with services and products they'd never before encountered. By providing consumers with a measure of protection, tort law enabled them to enter this new marketplace with a certain confidence and ease. Back in the days when toothpaste was a newfangled invention, for example, consumers could purchase it with a much greater sense of assurance when they knew that, because of tort law, the manufacturers had to take all reasonable steps to make certain that the product was both effective and safe. Maybe some of you will remember a passage in Huckleberry Finn that deals with this very subject. I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth, and it does take it off, too, and generally the enamel along with it. [ PERSON never mentions tort law, but it is there in the background, the force that kept this character in the book constantly on the run up and down the Mississippi.

I share your frustration, and I am determined to see things changed. I am convinced that a balanced budget amendment is the only way to force ORG, both the ORG and the executive branch, to live within its means. In fact, the very first address to ORG I made as President included a call for a balanced budget. I confidently presented a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the ORG. I asked our Nation's elected leaders to put GPE's best interests first and to join me in reaching a goal whose benefits will be measured in jobs and opportunity for ourselves and for our children. Government spending must be restrained and the budget balanced. Government is too big, and it spends too much. We are treating our national debt like the old fellow who borrowed money to pay off his loans. Inevitably, someone at some time must foot the bill. It is simply wrong to walk away from this mountain of debt and leave it to our kids. CARDINAL of our States have some kind of a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. It is time for ORG to follow their lead. We must balance the Federal budget without shifting the funding burden along to the GPE. We must pay our own way. Our future is at stake.

We should not be willing to risk our grandchildren's future on sound bites that merely sound real. A constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget is what is needed.

If you could single-handedly enact CARDINAL piece of regulation on the financial industry, what would it be? The story of Dodd-Frank is not yet complete, because the rules are still being developed. Dodd-Frank provided a platform to make sure that we end some of the most egregious practices and prevent another taxpayer-funded bailout. We have significantly increased capital requirements and essentially created a wind-down mechanism for institutions that make bad bets, so the whole system is not held hostage to them going under. We have to make sure that the rules issued around the Volcker Rule are actually enforced. So there is a lot of good work that will be done around Dodd-Frank. I have looked at some of ORG articles that say, This did not go far enough, we did not institute Glass-Steagall and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. So the problem in DATE's financial sector cannot be solved simply by reimposing models that were created in DATE.

You still have a situation where people making bets can get a huge upside, and their downsides are limited. So it tilts the whole system in favor of very risky behavior. I think a legitimate concern, even after Dodd-Frank, is, Have we completely changed those incentives? When investment banks, for example, were partnerships, as opposed to corporations, all those partners understood that if there was some tail risk out there - some unanticipated event that might result in the whole firm blowing up - that they were going to lose all their money, they were going to lose all their assets.

Is there something in what he says? We had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We could be growing even faster than we have if Governor PERSON's allies in ORG would move on some of the things that we have recommended. I will give you an example. On housing, right now we could make sure that families whose homes are underwater, where they owe more than their mortgage or more than their house is worth, if they refinance, typically they get MONEY in their pockets a year. That is $MONEY they are spending  or $MONEY that they are putting back into equity in their home. Governor PERSON opposes it. But do not you have a HAMP program?

Now, we have got a whole bunch of cities where you have got workers who are, you know, trained in machinery and advanced manufacturing, but and companies are starting to look at maybe we in-source instead of outsource. But we are going to have to change the tax code to make sure that companies have a strong incentive to do that.

His recent achievement in this area will certainly have a lasting effect on world peace and stability. I have no doubt that other steps will follow in the same direction during DATE. I am certain that regional conflicts will figure high on the agenda throughout DATE. Of these conflicts, the Middle East problems deserve special attention and priority. Strenuous efforts are needed to stop the war, which is still raging in the Gulf, and set the peace process in motion again. We have to demonstrate to all the parts concerned that peace is the only meaningful and effective way to settle disputes and solve problems. With this in mind, GPE has not hesitated at any point to take pioneering steps in order to make peace. It is for this reason, too, that I have proposed DATE a moratorium on all forms of violence and repression. I am quite convinced that this proposal, which is conceived as a preparatory step towards comprehensive peace, reflects the real sentiment of people of good will and human principles everywhere. No one who looks ahead and thinks of the future can accept the continuation of occupation and oppression. No one can, in good conscience, condone a policy of shooting and beating in a land that is holy to all of us. What I am proposing here is a policy of hope and positivity to replace despair and fear. I am sure that I am not alone in that, for I am backed by CARDINAL of men and women of courage and conviction everywhere. Let me seize this opportunity to thank all those NORP, NORP, and others who raise their voices in support of peace and in defense of liberty. Dear friends, NORP leaders have worked with NORP leaders over DATE in order to construct a model for friendship and cooperation among nations. In particular, President PERSON has made a great contribution to the development of friendly relations between GPE and GPE.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhestatedinnerforpresidentmohammedhosnimubarakegypt", "title": "Toasts at the State Dinner for President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak of Egypt", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-state-dinner-for-president-mohammed-hosni-mubarak-egypt", "publication_date": "28-01-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I, therefore, earnestly recommend that the necessity of an increase in the number of judges be supplied by legislation providing for the appointment of additional judges in all federal courts, without exception, where there are incumbent judges of retirement age who do not choose to retire or to resign. If an elder judge is not in fact incapacitated, only good can come from the presence of an additional judge in the crowded state of the dockets; if the capacity of an elder judge is in fact impaired, the appointment of an additional judge is indispensable. I also recommend that the ORG provide machinery for taking care of sudden or long-standing congestion in the lower courts. ORG should be given power to appoint an administrative assistant who may be called a Proctor. He would be charged with the duty of watching the calendars and the business of all the courts in the federal system. The Chief Justice thereupon should be authorized to make a temporary assignment of any circuit or district judge hereafter appointed This would not apply to the members of the bench at the present time, only the new ones in order that he may serve as long as needed in any circuit or district where the courts are in arrears. I attach a carefully considered draft of a proposed bill, which, if enacted, would, I am confident, afford substantial relief. The proposed measure also contains a limit on the total number of judges who might thus be appointed and also a limit on the potential size of any one of our federal courts. That bill, I might add, as I explained to the Chairmen of ORG of the ORG and ORG just now, is merely something for them to work on, as in any other case when any bill goes in. It is simply something for them to work on to save them trouble of trying to put the language together. These proposals do not raise any issue of constitutional law. Some of you may, perhaps, realize why I said what I did in my DATE message of DATE. They do not suggest any form of compulsory retirement for incumbent judges.

Much of what is concerned in that linkage, some of the very subjects you talked about, are not things that you headline in the paper. The fact that you do not proclaim such subjects or put them up there in the newspaper does not mean that they cannot be brought up when you are sitting at a table.

Well, there is a reservation, and there should be a reservation of all parties, and that is the reservation of security. In other words, people are not going to go forward with a process unless there is a full commitment to enhance the security of all people.

And I have worked hard to be a sensitive, open-minded person to that end. A lot of people in GPE talk about this. Looking ahead, do you think it is important for the NORP people to sort of view GPE mostly as a strategic competitor or more as a partner? I would call it a-I would-I think as we look ahead I would view it as a management of a complex relationship, where sometimes our national interests are aligned and sometimes our national interests are not aligned. They could-and let me just talk about the economy, for example. And CARDINAL reason I call it a complex relationship is that here in GPE, trade with GPE is not necessarily universally accepted as good. It is universally accepted as good in this administration. I mean, free and fair trade is good for the world, and I believe it is good for this relationship. But it is a-some in GPE view the advent of NORP manufacturing, particularly at the lower end of the economic scale, as direct competition with their own livelihood, thereby making the relationship complex. Energy-what is very interesting is that if you view GPE as a market, you want them to become more robust and more prosperous. But in order to do that, GPE is going to have to have more energy, and as GPE demands more energy, it creates more global demand relative to a slower growing supply, means higher prices for us all. It is a very interesting and important relationship made complex by globalization, and their constantly changing internal situation, particularly when it comes their economy. I am sure you have been reading about the GPE discussions. On the CARDINAL hand, we have got very good relations. On the other hand, it was hard to find common ground to get the GPE deal closed. So it is hard to label the relationship CARDINAL way or the other. An NORP President is going to have to pay very close attention to relations with not only GPE, but the region. And I say the region because if it ever-if the perception is ever that GPE is fixated only on GPE, then you are going to have issues with long-time allies, people that have been counting on the NORP support for a period of time.

You also spoke favorably about the notion of lowering rates and, as you just said, broadening the base by eliminating many exemptions. But right after you did that, you then called for CARDINAL new exemptions; namely, enterprise zones and tuition tax credits. Does not that just encourage others to try to carve out their own special places for their own pet write-offs and threaten to unravel that whole concept of lowering the base by broadening-or lowering the rates by broadening the base? Well, if you are trying to make a tax program more fair, which is also part of this proposal-take the issue you have raised of tuition tax credits. Here you have, I think, a very broad-based on fairness in the country-you have got people who are compelled to send their children to school under the law, because we believe that a democracy can only exist if you have a literate citizenry. And yet these people who, if they choose or feel they can get a better education for their children, choose a private or parochial school, independent school of some kind, they pay the full cost of sending their child to that school. But at the same time, they are paying the full cost that parents of children are paying-they are paying that in taxes to support the public school system. Now, if you stop and think what the additional cost to public schools would be if suddenly the independent schools closed and all those students were turned over to the educational market-and it would not mean an increase in revenues for public education, because already they are getting the money from those parents-you could see what a burden this would be. Well, it seems to me that it is only fair that some parent-as a matter of fact, the ultimate fairness would be educational vouchers. Does government properly support a school system, or does it provide the funds directly to the students to get an education?

It may affect the atmospherics, just, you know, the attitude about GPE. The main thing is every country in the region and throughout the world has a vested interest in seeing that no one who would either use or sell weapons of mass destruction especially chemical and biological weapons which could be carried around in small amounts, in little valises that no one who would use or sell them has a big program of them, which is why the whole ORG is against the NORP program. They need to think long and hard, these countries that have been a little squeamish about being firm, whether or not it is possible that they could be the victims of this, if not directly from GPE, from some group or another that GPE sells to in the future. So I think we need to be firm, and I am going to do my best to keep rallying support and keep working ahead. I prefer the inspections. I prefer the diplomatic pressure. I have not been triggerhappy on this; some here in our country think that we should have acted before. But I do not think we can rule out any option.

We are on the eve of the disengagement, and you have expressed your full support in disengagement, trying to help Prime Minister PERSON in his struggle. And I would like to ask why is it so important to you, ENTITY? First of all, let me speak about my relationship with Prime Minister PERSON, if you do not mind. We have grown close, and one of the reasons why is I appreciate a person who when he says something, means it. And I hope he appreciates that about me. In other words, I said early on, we are going to join in fighting terror so that GPE could be secure and GPE secure and other free nations secure. Secondly-and I have-and he knows I keep my word, and I know he keeps his word. Secondly, what I appreciate is somebody who thinks boldly for peace. And PERSON came to FAC and said, We are going to disengage from the GPE. And the disengagement is, I think, a part of making GPE more secure and peaceful, and I agree with the Prime Minister. It is important because GPE is a strong ally of GPE and, therefore, if you are a strong ally, you want there to be peace for your ally. You know, the main concern of GPE is that the disengagement might lead not to more security but, on the contrary, to more violence. Do you understand the concerns? And I can understand why people think this decision is one that will create a vacuum into which terrorism will flow. I think this will create an opportunity for democracy to emerge, and democracies are peaceful. And therefore, it is very important for GPE, as an active participant in this process, to encourage the formation of security forces that will defeat terror, just like the roadmap calls for-these are NORP security forces-and to encourage the NORP to develop a peaceful state. You had announced that you will support the disengagement by some aid the administration will provide GPE to develop the northern and southern-the Galilee and the Negev. Has any decision been made regarding this issue? Well, first of all, I did say when the Prime Minister was here that the Negev and Galilee present great opportunities for economic development.

What does this prove, or does it prove anything? The only thing I know is that I have had a report that GPE is holding in jail CARDINAL members of the PERSON group. And this, in itself, could be a reason for them taking an action in an effort to blackmail GPE into releasing its members. Sir, said at his press conference DATE that you had concentrated on the activities of NORP terrorism-I think he used that word-and ignored the root causes for it. What would your reaction be to that? Well, again, Mr. 's speaking quite loosely and without any regard to the truth and the facts. We have said from the very beginning in the peace process that the problem of the NORP refugees had to be a part of the peace process and there had to be a resolution of that problem, and we still feel that way. ENTITY, economic sanctions against GPE would evidently hurt the NORP economy. The sanctions you have ordered do not necessarily hurt the NORP economy. If Chancellor , for example, would sit here with us, how would you try to explain to him that it might be worthwhile in the long term to pay a price? Well, as I say, I understood the problems of some of our allies and friends. Their trade is on a greater basis than ours. And a matter of fact, we are probably the lowest on the ladder of trade with GPE, and this due in part to the fact that we already had partial sanctions that were put in effect DATE. So, I am aware of that, and I know that problem. Is it a permanent trade that they can go on then-and we have seen the newsreels on television-the armed guards, the military forces, policemen carrying submachine guns and so forth at the airports and the various public buildings of countries such as GPE and the others, GPE, all these other allies-can they see this as a fair trade?

So I hope that my trip here and the longterm rekindling of the relationship with GPE that I am committed to for our country can basically, slowly, over time, take this in a different direction.

It is not unique to CARDINAL party. But when it comes to certain positions on issues, when it comes to trying to do what is best for the country, when it comes to really trying to make decisions based on fact as opposed to ideology, when it comes to being willing to compromise, the NORP, not just here in FAC, but I would say in ORG also, have shown themselves consistently to be willing to do tough things even when it is not convenient, because it is the right thing to do. And we have not seen that same kind of attitude on the other side. Until NORP feel that there is a real price to pay for them just saying no and being obstructionist, you will probably see at least a number of them arguing that we should keep on doing it. It worked for them in DATE election cycle, and I think there are those who believe that it can work again. I disagree with them, and I think the cost to the country has been enormous. But if you look at the most recent fiscal deal, I presented to Speaker PERSON a package that would have called for MONEY in new revenue-less than I actually think we need, but in the spirit of compromise-and MONEY in spending cuts, some of which are very difficult.

But in the case of PERSON, we have not seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence. We do not want somebody who is been nominated by a NORP a claim that I would have never made at the time. Now what is true, ENTITY, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice PERSON was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court.

You cannot point to me a circumstance in which NORP have left a seat open when a NORP ORG was in office simply because they did not like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court. Justice PERSON was confirmed by PERSON, and I am quite certain that there were a whole lot of NORP senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues.

He is committed to dealing with that. Sometimes you have got to make sure, though, that the commitment is coupled with the capacity to deal with it, and that is one of the concerns that we are helping them deal with. In other words, the NORP leadership as well as the NORP leadership has to know that when they negotiate a vision, it will be supported by people in the region.

The progress of the world rests on courage, honor and faith. If GPE wishes to maintain its prosperity, it must maintain its ideals. When we turn to our foreign relations, we see the working out of the same laws. If there is CARDINAL ideal of national existence to which GPE has adhered more consistently than to any other, it has been that of peace. Whatever other faults may be charged to our country, it has never been quarrelsome, belligerent, or bent on military aggrandisement. After all, the main support of peace is understanding. It is a matter of accurate information by CARDINAL government and CARDINAL people about other governments and other peoples.

The classic case is GPE, where I have spent a lot of time with the NORP President talking about the dangers of GPE having a nuclear weapon, knowing full well that they need fuel in order to meet their own internal pressures. PERSON has been very open in many ways about his concerns and the pressures he feels, as have I. And by the way, that is not easy when there is a language barrier.

And that may sound trite to you, but nevertheless, it is a part of getting comfortable with each other.

Divided into CARDINAL, or even a smaller number, of separate communities, we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints and exactions; communication between distant points and sections obstructed or cut off; our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now till in peace; the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies, and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming our lawgivers and judges. The loss of liberty, of all good government, of peace, plenty, and happiness, must inevitably follow a dissolution of the ORG. In supporting it, therefore, we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist. The time at which I stand before you is full of interest.

I give the reassurance, the absolute commitment that, if the cross-community provisions in the agreement to exclude people from office if they engage in violence, if those do not work, then they will be changed. That will be in the legislation. I give the explicit commitment to people that decommissioning will be a factor that we take into account, a factor there, specified in the legislation, so that, if people are not abiding by the decommissioning arrangements of ORG, then that can mean their exclusion or removal from office.

But then all of these exceptions were added, and it really makes it appear that it is one of the most complicated proposals ever. Did you make a mistake allowing all the special exceptions to be included in the Btu tax? Some of them were included in the ORG bill, and I did not agree with all of them. But let me say what I think was a good criticism of the tax and that is that we wanted the tax to restrain energy consumption in ways that promoted energy conservation and also supported fuel switching to more environmentally beneficial and more available natural gas. That bill, as drawn, would be a big boon to the natural gas industry in GPE and GPE and throughout GPE. And that is one of the things we were trying to do. Now, some of the oil companies did not like it, but the people that were in the gas business liked it. We had a big GPE gas company, headed by a person who strongly supported President PERSON in the last election, endorsed the economic program. ORG and ORG both endorsed the economic program, including the Btu tax. So Secretary PERSON, who, as you know, has represented you in the ORG for a long time, offered the ORG a modified Btu tax which, instead of having all those particular exemptions, would basically have alleviated the burden of the Btu tax on industry and agriculture on the production sector but still given them an incentive to move toward natural gas wherever possible and would also have cut the Btu rate and would have replaced that with more spending cuts. From my point of view, unfortunately, we could not pass that through the committee because Senator PERSON had said he would not vote for any tax based on the heat content of fuel. But I still think it was a good concept, and it will be interesting to see what happens if the ORG's version of the economic plan passes, to see what happens in the conference and what we come up with.

The reason that I have not used the particular phrase radical Islam on a regular basis is because, in talking to NORP allies, in talking to the NORP-American community here, that was being heard as if we were ascribing to crazy groups like ORG or ORG the mantle of ORG. And since we need them as allies, I think it is useful for us to listen to how the president of GPE' words and messages are being received, because, if we are going to defeat those organizations, we need help from the CARDINAL NORP in this world, so that they can help root out this perversion of ORG that is taking place.

If ORG would take the things we want to do and put it into law, the ORG would lose jurisdiction.

And virtually all of them talked about how much stronger agriculture was as a result of it. With regard to ORG and GPE, some of our livestock people have been concerned about how ORG would play and whether it would hurt them. With the GATT agreement, which is a worldwide trade agreement, there is no question that our farmers will be better off because other countries subsidize their farmers more than we subsidize ours. So if everybody has to reduce subsidies to an equal basis, NORP farmers will come out way ahead because we have the best, most competitive, most productive farmers in the world. If we can get a decent farm bill out of the ORG, that is, one that continues to reduce the cost of the farm programs but does not take us out of global competition and does not really wreck the family farm, then I think the future of agriculture is bright. In fact, I think we may have seen a bottoming out of the number of farmers.

He talked about the schoolchildren who visit ORG and proudly recite what they had been taught about the living Constitution. Judge PERSON noted that he usually had the sad duty of telling the children that the Constitution was never alive. He believed, as I do and many in this hall believe, that the Constitution is not a living document, it is an enduring document, and good judges know the difference. And I made a promise to the NORP people during the campaign that if I was fortunate enough to be elected, my administration would seek out judicial nominees who follow that philosophy. We would search from a diverse array of candidates and nominate those who met the highest standards of competence. We would not impose any litmus tests concerning particular issues or cases. Instead, we would seek judges who would faithfully interpret the Constitution and not use the courts to invent laws or dictate social policy. And with your support, we have kept that pledge. I have appointed CARDINAL of all the judges now sitting on the ORG bench, and these men and women are jurists of the highest caliber, with an abiding belief in the sanctity of our Constitution. The judicial philosophy that I brought to GPE, GPE, is demonstrated most clearly by the-some of the judges I have named to the bench-matter of fact, all the judges I have named to the bench. CARDINAL of them is the son of an NORP NORP-schoolteachers from GPE, GPE. He graduated from ORG and ORG.

And let me tell you why it is in your interest. For CARDINAL thing, GPE needs good customers for its products. And GPE, a free GPE with a free economy, would prefer to do business with GPE over any other country. And they prefer to buy our farm products and other products, and we have to look ahead. Every year we have to be looking ahead to find more and more markets for our products because as we get drawn into the global economy, we have got to sell more to other people to keep our incomes high. Secondly, we have a real interest in keeping GPE democratic and keeping them committed to reducing their nuclear arsenals. Because otherwise we have to turn right around and rebuild our defenses at very high levels, spend huge amounts of taxpayers' money on nuclear arsenals, raise our children in a more dangerous world, and divert needed resources which ought to be spent on education and training and investment here at home.

{"id": 2385, "text": "All the discussion leading up to what ORG was going to do DATE on interest rates was all premised on the fact that we are having a great national debate now, because no one thought DATE, DATE that we could possibly have average growth well in excess of PERCENT and unemployment PERCENT without having inflation. So we do not have any signs of inflation, but should not they be worried about it, since nobody really thought we could have it? Everyone knows that the technology explosion, especially in telecommunications and information technology, has dramatically increased productivity in ways that traditional economic models do not measure. Is there any way we could keep this economic recovery going, creating even more jobs, raising incomes even more, and not have inflation? And the answer is, yes, if you can either find more customers for NORP goods and services or more workers to come in and produce more so they are not just being added on for the same level of production. Now, what are the possibilities for that? Expanded trade, which is why I have worked very hard to build a consensus in my own party for trade, plus labor and environmental standards- why I went to GPE and made those speeches, why I went to ORG and all that-for trade. The most obvious ones in GPE are more people from welfare to work. TIME I had PERSON at the fundraiser, if you listened in on that. He is now got CARDINAL companies in this deal where we are trying to hire even hard-to-place welfare recipients and train them. Because that is adding to the productive capacity. You get people who are both workers and consumers. The other big discrete population are the disabled, which is why this thing that apparently we are going to have an overwhelming bipartisan majority of ORG do, which is to let disabled people keep their ORG in the work force, it is potentially a very big, positive contribution to long-term growth, because, again, you are creating more workers and more consumers. Now, the third big opportunity is to find what areas have not been fully reached with investment and jobs in growth. And that is what this is about. Now, I want to talk about CARDINAL things when we go there.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanpageusatodayaboardairforceone", "title": "Interview With Susan Page of USA Today Aboard Air Force One", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-page-usa-today-aboard-air-force-one", "publication_date": "30-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 685, "text": "  Your first DATE and what just might be your very last trip to Europe as ENTITY include both includes both times a stop in GPE. I do not blame you for saying it. First of all, my first trip was consequential because that is where I first met PERSON. This trip is consequential because, of course, we are going to have an ORG-U.S. summit. And my impressions of GPE I have told this to a lot of people is first of all, it is a beautiful country. Probably somewhat undiscovered in GPE, but my fellow citizens ought to go and explore GPE cause it is , I think, not only it is got I mean, you can ski, you can play golf. It is a lot of opportunities for mountain biking. You are coming for the GPE summit. But it will be the last summit for you. What outcome would you like to see? Well, you know, look, the important thing about these summits is that it reaffirms our mutual values of human rights and human liberty, of our desire to work together on some key issues. And GPE and Europe has had its differences on certain issues, and but we have always had the same common values. And it is important for me to signal to the NORP, as well as my fellow citizens, that this relationship is an important relationship. And I am confident the next ENTITY, will see it as an important relationship as well. But we will discuss a lot of important issues there too. You are also coming to celebrate the 60th anniversary of PERSON plan and Berlin Airlift, the historic role GPE had after World War II in supporting Europe. Western Balkans, CARDINAL new states; GPE high on a priority list for GPE's Presidency. I would like to hear, what do you think are the most memorable events, Europe-wise, that your administration helped to achieve in DATE? Well, CARDINAL, of course, is the expansion of ORG. And it is a I will never forget going to GPE right after nations some nations were admitted into ORG and talking about Article 5 an attack on one is an attack on all. And a lot of countries had come from a different style of government and a different type of security arrangements to one in which free nations were bound together. And so the expansion of ORG and the offering of sending a positive signal to GPE and GPE recently has been an incredibly positive accomplishment.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnatasabriskisloveniaspoptv", "title": "Interview With Natasa Briski of Slovenia's POP TV", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-natasa-briski-slovenias-pop-tv", "publication_date": "06-06-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.
