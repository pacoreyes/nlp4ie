Number one, the FBI under no circumstances should do anything they should not spy on Members of Congress. I do not think they ought to spy on law-abiding American citizens. But there are certain areas where the FBI has a legal responsibility. The FBI has the responsibility to check on individuals who are charged with a crime any American citizen, including a Member of Congress. The FBI, if they are seeking to employ somebody or if somebody applies for a job, the FBI has an obligation to check on that person's record. Congress at the present time served in the FBI at various times prior to being elected to the House or to the Senate. So, the FBI ought to have files on those people. Now, in addition, as I understand it, the FBI in the course of investigating a person gets information concerning somebody else, and that may be information concerning a Member of Congress.

I think those are all -- that is the full range of things that we are supervising. For those who wonder and ask the question, what was the time lapse for the designation of an incident of national significance? Can you walk us through that? Because when I talked to Thad Allen on Friday, he said you really have to look at this as two calendar events -- the explosion, the search and rescue, putting out the fire; then a catastrophic leak. He said you really need to measure these as sort of two separate instances of intervention at the federal level and with BP. Do you view the calendar that way, and that day one is when the leak became the top priority after dealing with the explosion and the search and rescue and everything else? 30 p.m. that night -- to assist in the fire that was ongoing and to ensure that all that could be was being done to get folks that were injured off, and to look for those that were missing. I think pretty quickly after that, though, it is pretty clear that there is, for whatever reason, oil in the water. The response -- I think there were -- I'd have to go back and look at my notes -- I think there were some 70 vessels in the water, there were scores of planes in the air, dealing with this even at that point of designating it a spill of national significance. This is a response that has been ongoing since the report of that explosion some many days ago. How would you characterize what happened in Times Square? Was that an act of terrorism?

So, it is vitally important that the Congress move on this legislation. Now, let me cite some specific figures the impact of general revenue sharing. The city of Charlotte has received over $20 million in this program since its inception about 4 1/2 years ago, and Mecklenburg County has received more than $10 million. I recommended a 5 3/4-year extension of the legislation and, under that legislation during the full term of its existence, Charlotte would receive $31,600,000 and Mecklenburg County, $15 million-plus. And the figures for the State of North Carolina would be greater under the program I recommended than they have received under the existing program. This is something that we all know has worked well with the Federal Government collecting the money and sending it back to the States and to the local communities with a minimum amount of redtape and a maximum amount of local decisionmaking by the Governors and by the locally elected officials, the people who honestly know what the problems are. I think we ought to encourage this trend of giving the decisionmaking to the people at the local level, and revenue sharing has been probably the most successful Federal program in that regard. Now, in fighting for general revenue sharing, and in many other legislative efforts, Jim has proven his expertise, his deep commitment to service and his truly outstanding representation here for all of you. Let me summarize by saying Jim is a darned good Member of the Congress, and I hope and trust that you will keep working for him in the years ahead. That brings me to another incidental reason I am in North Carolina today. There is a rumor going around that North Carolina is planning a Presidential primary next Tuesday.

ENTITY, what further cuts in welfare spending will be necessary in the next ENTITY administration? And secondly, how do you answer your opponents who say that you are practicing social Darwinism? Well, I answer them-first of all, I challenge the Urban Institute's figures. And I do not think that they can be substantiated at all, because we are spending more money today and helping more people than at any time in our nation's history. With regard to food, the increase in food programs is up 37 percent over what it was. We made cuts in suggested increases. We have reduced-on the domestic side of the budget-we have reduced the rate of increase in spending from 17 percent down to 6 percent. But in many of these figures, for example in food stamps, some of the so-called savings in food stamps-we are , incidentally, giving more food stamps to more people than we have ever done before in history. There are something like, oh, I think somewhere around 3 million more people are getting them than were getting them in 1980. But here we found, for example, that in food stamps, someone applied for food stamps, let us say it is 3 days before the end of the month, they were given the whole month's food stamps for the preceding month, for just those few days of the month left. Now, come the first of the month, they were due, again, a quota for the coming month. And we started giving them food stamps as of the day they asked for them, not retroactively for weeks before they'd put in the request. And that amounted to quite a percentage, in a reduction. We also, in many of these programs, found that there were people who were above an income level as to where they should be eligible for these programs, and what we did was redirect the attention down. And we have set for ourselves a standard of 130 percent of poverty-that that was the limit. Above that, it would have to be an exceptional case.

Obviously, we have a position, and our position is that problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and we think that they should be resolved soon-the issue of Libya, the issue of Syria-because that will help us greatly. And I have also told President Obama about what I am doing at the EU so the EU gets involved in resolving problems at the point of origin. A young person who has no prospects in his or her country-who has no prospects to live in his country, who cannot have a dignified life-will do anything he can to leave his or her country and find something elsewhere. So problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and countries need to be helped. And we have to do it together with the European Union. We have also talked about NATO relations. We have talked about Rota, Morn. And I think things have been done properly with the consensus of most of Spanish society. And that is very good for Spain, and it is also very good for the United States and for all of us who defend democracy, freedom, human rights, and security for people. Bilateral relations at this time are wonderful from all perspectives. The United States is the top investor in Spain-foreign investor. Lastly, we have also addressed the situation in Cuba. We are optimistic for the future. And in Colombia, we wish lots of luck to President Santos because he is deploying great efforts. And we have also talked about Venezuela and the need to normalize the situation. So we have addressed issues which are very important for Spain and for the United States. And I would like to conclude by saying, anyone who wants to hear me, that President Obama is a good friend of Spain's and a good friend of Spaniards. He is honest and a person that we have cooperated with very pleasantly. We would be very pleased if he came back to Spain. Well, let me begin by thanking Prime Minister Rajoy and his team and the Spanish people for welcoming us. It has been an extraordinarily gracious and warm welcome, particularly given the tough situation that we have had at home and my need to rearrange my schedule.

And then we keep on waiting for their plan of a better way of doing it, and they do not produce it. Well, the reason is, is because actually we have taken the best ideas, conservative ideas, liberal ideas, and we have put them together and we are now implementing them.

It does not mean that at some point there will not be some additional problems or improvements that we can make. Do you have anything in mind in the near future?  At this point I think actually it is working the way it should. But I, what we need to do is after the first year we will evaluate what the pool looks like. Can we make sure that we are keeping the premiums low? Are there more people that we could potentially cover through other mechanisms, reaching those who are still uninsured? The biggest improvement I'd like to see right now is for the Governors in states like Texas and Florida to expand Medicaid. Because a state like Texas has the highest uninsured rate in the nation. Keep in mind, the state of Texas would not have to pay itself more money to cover these people. This is money that the federal law and the federal government would provide, all they have to do is to agree to accept these dollars to help their citizens, their residents to do the right thing. And the idea that you would not do that for political reasons I think is, that is something I'd like to see improved. But that does not have to do with making a change in the law.

I knew their families, their children, their circumstances. Just last weekend I went home to dedicate an airport, and the first people that came running up to me were the three State police officers who were assigned to work the event. And we stood there and relived a lot of old times. And I think, again, we should thank, especially, the Members of Congress who are here; the police officers; Gil Gallegos and the FOP; Thomas Nee and the National Association of Police Officers; Jerry Flynn, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers; Rich Gallo, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; Sam Cabral, the International Union of Police; and Debbie Geary from the Concerns of Police Survivors. I'd like to ask you all just to give them all another hand. Six years ago when I became ENTITY, one of my most urgent priorities was to put the Federal Government on the side of supporting our police officers and reducing the crime rate. At the time, the crime rate was on the rise; gangs, guns, and drugs were sweeping through our neighborhoods, terrorizing our families, cutting off the future of too many of our children. The thing that bothered me most when I was out around the country seeking the Presidency was that there were so many people who were full of hope and optimism for our country, but when it came to crime, they seemed almost to have given up, to have simply accepted the fact that a rising crime rate was a part of the price of the modern world. We were able to galvanize, all of us together, the energies of the American people to fight back. I never met a law enforcement officer who believed that a rising crime rate was inevitable. Every law enforcement officer I met believed that if we did the right things-if we were tough, yes, but tough was not enough; we had to be smart, too-that if we both punished people who should be punished and did the intelligent things to prevent crime from happening in the first place, that the crime rate could go down. And we passed in 1994 a historic crime bill, along with the Brady law, which among other things focused on community policing, aggressive prevention, and tougher penalties for violent repeat offenders.

In Europe, America's sons meet tonight in peace with yesterday's allies--and adversaries alike--to plan the works of future unity instead of worrying about the wounds of past conflict. Here in Washington tonight we gather to honor an institution of higher learning which was established as an act of compassion in those times of callous strife 100 years ago. The character of our Nation is comprised of many traits. We honor courage. We value commonsense. But, across our 188 years, the great cementing influence has always been compassion. In our purposes abroad and at home we have always heeded the injunction of the Apostle, who told us long ago, Be ye of one mind, showing compassion one of another. Yet, our wealthy society is tolerating a worrisome burden of wasted human lives. Tonight, too many of our people are unschooled, untrained, and underemployed. Too many are mentally handicapped, too many more are handicapped for life by the environments and the experiences of their childhoods. America needs these talents.

When knowledge is advancing at this pace, a compassionate nation cannot afford to leave any segments of our society behind to form, and to perpetuate, a human slag heap.

This was the first--and is still the only--college in the world for the deaf.

So how can we make them a part of that? Well, you know China and Russia and some other countries around the world that do not have a democratic government and do not have the same traditions of free speech and open Internet, they have recognized. I think that the Internet's so powerful that if people start being able to communicate then they maybe start criticizing the government. And then they may be able to mobilize opposition. And things that are unfair or people who are being mistreated suddenly have a voice. So they are trying to keep a lid on things. And we consistently, wherever we go, insist that issues like free speech and a free and open Internet, we think that that is part of who we are as a people. We think that that has value not just in America but everywhere. We obviously cannot make laws in China. But what we can do is let them know and shine a spotlight on some of those practices and indicate to them that any government that is afraid of its own people and people just peacefully trying t speak out and voice their own opinions is over the long term not going to be as effective and as long-lasting as a government that trusts its people to be able to communicate freely.

Well, the truth of the matter is that the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said you know what? We should start colleges.

Much of the misinformation about what we are trying to do comes from the bureaucracies who feel threatened because they have a nice living administering those programs. But as to the people, let us take one-you mentioned educators-the educators and the charge that we are somehow taking away the possibility of help for needy students to go to college. What we are really doing-we found that much of the aid, the low-interest loans and the grants, were going to students whose families had incomes that suggested the families could do more to help send their children to college. We have redirected this help down to a financial level that makes sure that those people who are close to the poverty line can have the help they need for their sons and daughters to go to college. And probably the greatest thing that we have done for the poor is the reduction in the rate of inflation which was roughly 12 1/2 percent when we started-for 2 years, double-digit inflation. We have more than cut that in half. We have reduced that way down to where for the last few months it is probably only a fourth of that amount. But let me tell you what that inflation rate already has done for those who are poor, who have to spend every penny for the necessities of life, and therefore as the prices go up, they can buy less and less of the necessities. Families at the poverty level today, with the cuts that we have already made in the inflation rate, have several hundred dollars more in purchasing power than they had a year ago under the previous high inflation rate.

I remember the moral clarity of the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who said that partial-birth abortion is, quote, as close to infanticide as anything I have ever come upon. Many Democrats look at my opponent and see an attitude that is much more extreme. He says that life begins at conception but denies that our caring society should prevent even partial-birth abortion. Preventing partial-birth abortion is an ethical conviction shared by many people of every faith and by people who have no religion at all. I understand good people disagree on the life issue, so I have worked with Republicans and Democrats to find common ground on difficult questions and to move this goodhearted Nation toward a culture of life. If you are a Democrat who believes that our society must always have room for the voiceless and the vulnerable, I would be honored to have your vote. There are Democrats all over America, north and south, east and west, who believe their party's nominee does not share their deepest values. I know the Democrats are not going to agree with me on every issue. Yet on the big issues of our country's security, victory in the war against terror, improving our public schools, respecting marriage and human life, I hope people who usually vote for the other party will take a close look at my agenda. If you are a Democrat and your dreams and goals are not found in the far left wing of the Democrat Party, I'd be honored to have your vote. And next Tuesday, I ask you to stand with me. And I want to thank each and every one of you who have come today for standing with me. I appreciate your support. I appreciate your convictions. I appreciate your good work. I believe in the future of this country. One of my favorite quotes was written by a Texan named Tom Lea. He said this, he said, Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain.

We do not simply welcome new immigrants, we do not simply welcome new arrivals, we are born of immigrants. And for more than two centuries, it is remained at the core of our national character.

The first refugees were the Pilgrims themselves, fleeing religious persecution, crossing the stormy Atlantic to reach a new world where they might live and pray freely. Eight signers of the Declaration of Independence were immigrants. And in those first decades after independence, English, German, and Scottish immigrants came over, huddled on creaky ships, seeking what Thomas Paine called asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty. Down through the decades, Irish Catholics fleeing hunger, Italians fleeing poverty filled up our cities, rolled up their sleeves, built America. Chinese laborers jammed in steerage under the decks of steamships, making their way to California to build the Central Pacific Railroad that would transform the West and our Nation.

And when you stop to think that that explosion was less than the power of one single warhead, and we are talking about exchanges of thousands of warheads. I was interested one day not too long ago, back around the time of our summit meeting here, to hear in this room my own words coming back to me, not with any acknowledgement that they were mine-maybe he did not know it-but from a Soviet official who word for word said, a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. The Germans, for example-there are a few people across a political aisle who after INF believe-or are very nervous about modernizing short-range nuclear missiles. They say the shorter the range of the nuclear missiles in central Europe the more dead are the Germans. How can you reconcile these people? Well, I know, and I have talked with the Chancellor many times about this. And they see the possibility of-if such a war would occur-they would be the battlefield, largely. But at the same time, as I say, those weapons-I have to repeat myself-those weapons are the thing that right at the moment are kind of wiping out the imbalance in conventional weapons. And when you look at that imbalance, you have to say that the Soviet Union's military does not really represent a defensive force; it is far beyond the bounds of what is needed for defense. And so, you look at that as an offensive force. And since the nuclear weapons have been hailed as a deterrent to prevent war, I think that it is only logical that if we negotiate those battlefield tactical weapons and their reduction or elimination, that must be accompanied by the same kind of negotiations with regard to conventional weapons so that we come down to a parity and do not suddenly eliminate a form of weapon that leaves the other side with a great superiority.

We are a nation of homes from which the accomplishment of individuals is nurtured by the maximum freedom in an ordered liberty. The ultimate goal of our progress is to build for security and happiness in these homes where the inspiration of our religious faiths will implant in our children those principles of social order and idealism, and where our Government will contribute in safeguarding their future opportunity for them. The action of our Nation has been modified and benefited by the enfranchisement of women. They equally with the men bear the shocks from economic disaster. With them lies largely the guardianship of the fundamental ideals, because concentrated in their lives and their responsibilities is a solicitude for the preservation of the home and the inspiration for the future. And in these labors our Government can contribute to strengthen their accomplishment and their influence.

And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to give up. In 2009, the United States gave negotiations yet another chance, and offered North Korea the open hand of engagement. The regime responded by sinking a South Korean Navy ship, killing 46 Korean sailors. To this day, it continues to launch missiles over the sovereign territory of Japan and all other neighbors, test nuclear devices, and develop ICBMs to threaten the United States itself.

For ENTITY of the United States cannot approach a question from one side or the other; on each issue that comes to the Oval Office there normally are an infinite number of sides and of competing considerations to be resolved or chosen among. This reflects the fact, of course, that the easy questions are not the ones that come to the President; those are decided at other levels. The ones that he must decide are the ones on which there are disagreements, even among members of his own administration who share his own goals but who have different perspectives or different judgments about the best way to achieve those goals. They deal not simply with right versus wrong but with varying degrees of right and wrong, with various balances of legitimate but competing interests, and with varying judgments about how best to accomplish what is right. And so the study of the Presidency is a study, in the final analysis, of the difficult decision, the close question. But I have found that the more deeply I study the Presidency, the more firm I become in my faith that throughout our history, the basic high principle of those who have been called upon to govern has been one of the great sustaining strengths of America. I believe this has been true because the office inhabits the man, just as the man inhabits the office. No one holds that office without a profound sense of obligation-to the country, to the world, and to the future. that each one who has been President has recognized, in his turn, that he is the one who must speak for all the people of America. A man of one region must speak for all regions. A man of one party must strive to see how problems look from the other party's point of view.

From Thanksgiving to Hanukkah, which our Jewish community is now celebrating, to Christmas in 3 weeks' time, this is a season of hope and of love. Certainly one of the greatest blessings for people everywhere is the family itself. The American Family Institute recently dedicated its book of essays, The Family in the Modern World, to Maria Victoria Walesa, daughter of Danuta and Lech Walesa, to whose christening came 7,000 Poles expressing their belief that the family remains the foundation of freedom. And, of course, they are right. It is in the family where we learn to think for ourselves, care for others, and acquire the values of self-reliance, integrity, responsibility, and compassion. Families stand at the center of society, so building our future must begin by preserving family values. namely, that bigger government is the greatest force for fairness and progress. But this so-called solution has given most of us a bad case of financial indigestion. How can families survive when big government's powers to tax, inflate, and regulate absorb their wealth, usurp their rights, and crush their spirit? It now takes $85,000 to raise a child to age 18, and family incomes have not kept up. During the 1970's real wages actually declined over 2 percent. In 1948 the tax on the average two-child family was just $9. As economic and social pressures have increased, the bonds that bind families together have come under strain. For example, three times as many families are headed by single parents today as in 1960. Many single parents make heroic sacrifices and deserve all our support. But there is no question that many well-intentioned Great Society-type programs contributed to family breakups, welfare dependency, and a large increase in births out of wedlock. In the 1970's the number of single mothers rose from 8 to 13 percent among whites and from 31 to a tragic 47 percent among blacks. Too often their children grow up poor, malnourished, and lacking in motivation. It is a path to social and health problems, low school performance, unemployment, and delinquency. If we strengthen families, we will help reduce poverty and the whole range of other social problems.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationtheamericanfamily", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on the American Family", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-the-american-family", "publication_date": "03-12-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Last week, the first battalion of the New Iraqi ENTITY completed its training. Within a year, Iraq will have a 40,000-member military force. Tens of thousands of Iraqi citizens are also guarding their own borders, defending vital facilities, and policing their own streets. Six months ago, the Iraqi people welcomed their liberation. Today, many Iraqis are armed and trained to defend their liberty. Our goal in Iraq is to leave behind a stable, self-governing society which will no longer be a threat to the Middle East or to the United States. We are following an orderly plan to reach this goal. Iraq now has a Governing Council, which has appointed interim Government ministers. Once a constitution has been written, Iraq will move toward national elections. The free institutions of Iraq must stand the test of time. And a democratic Iraq will stand as an example to all the Middle East. We believe, and the Iraqi people will show, that liberty is the hope and the right of every land. Our work in Iraq has been long. We will stay the course. We will complete our job. And beyond Iraq, the war on terror continues. I am confident of victory because I know the character of our military, shown in people like Master Sergeant Jack Negrotti of Plaistow, New Hampshire.

And I am looking into a lot of faces of people who make decisions that can probably have more impact on prices than I can. For 2 years now I have urged business and labor in many, many conferences I have had at the White House to bargain responsibly to reach decisions that will not trigger inflation. And I am proud to report to you that many businessmen and many labor leaders have responded with restraint and with self-discipline to their President's pleas.

It is possible, but it is not going to be possible if we do not spend money on research and development. So we are spending $150 million to combine Government money with private research money in solar technologies to see if we cannot help foster technologies that will be able to capture the sun, feed it into your house, generate enough electricity, and if you have got a little excess, feed it back into the grid. Finally, I want to talk about nuclear power a subject you all are very familiar with. It is a really important way to meet our goals, which is to have abundant, affordable, clean, and safe sources of energy. In other words, you have nuclear powerplants, you can say, we have got an abundant amount of electricity. And once you get the plant up and running, the operating costs of these plants are significantly lower than other forms of electricity plants, which means the energy is affordable. As I mentioned, nuclear power it is the second leading source of electricity here. We have 100 nuclear powerplants that operate in 31 States. Now, we have not built one in a long period of time. People in our country are rightly concerned about greenhouse gases and the environment, and I can understand why; I am too. As a matter of fact, I try to tell people, let us quit the debate about whether greenhouse gases are caused by mankind or by natural causes; let us just focus on technologies that deal with the issue. Nuclear power will help us deal with the issue of greenhouse gases. Without nuclear energy, carbon dioxide emissions would have been 28 percent greater in the electricity industry in 2004. Without nuclear power, we would have had an additional 700 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, and that is nearly equal to the annual emissions from 136 million passenger cars. Nuclear power helps us protect the environment. It is safe because of advances in science and engineering and plant design. It is safe because the workers and managers of our nuclear powerplants are incredibly skilled people who know what they are doing. For the sake of economic security and national security, the United States of America must aggressively move forward with the construction of nuclear power-plants.

That is not the definition of good relations. Good relations is mutual respect and a desire to work together to solve common problems and, most importantly, though, adherence to common values.

These reforms are necessary to stay ahead of the threats. I urge Congress to act quickly so I can sign them into law. My opponent has taken a different approach, and it shows in his record.

Let me just give you one example of something that really concerns me. Over the last 20 years, too many of our schools have abandoned their music, their arts, and their physical education programs. You may have noticed that last week I went to New York City to be on the Today Show to talk about the VH1 music in school program, where they worked so hard to get instruments back into schools so schools can start their school music programs again. There is so much evidence that a lot of young people learn better if they have access early to music and arts programs. But it is also really troubling to me that so many schools have just completely abandoned physical education programs for all kids, while maintaining team sports. Now, a lot of the athletes behind me may be going to the Olympics in sports for which there was no competition in their schools. And they would not necessarily have been football or basketball players, or even soccer players, if their schools had competitive soccer. The percentage of high school students in daily physical education has declined more than 30 percent in the last 10 years. Today, fewer than one in three students are enrolled in phys-ed every day. Meanwhile, the percentage of young people who are overweight has doubled in the same time period. And we know that it has an effect on learning, on self-image, on self-esteem, on a sense of what you can do. Today I am directing our Secretary of Education, Dick Riley, and Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to work with the U.S. Olympic Committee, our physical fitness council, and others to try to find ways to encourage more young people to get fit and stay fit. And I am asking Congress to establish a foundation that will leverage the energy, creativity, and resources of the private sector in furthering the mission of the President's Council on Physical Fitness, to help every young person in America to live an active, safe, and healthy life.

And fortunately both my chief of staff and my national-security adviser have even bigger potty mouths than me, so it is O.K. And the second thing is that I can be much more sarcastic and, I think, sometimes withering in my assessments of things than I allow to show in my public life. Well, we see it sometimes. Yes, every once in a while you see it. You have said you'd rather be alive now than any other time. But do you ever wish you had been president in another era?

And Teddy Roosevelt was right for the era when punchy language worked. F.D.R. was perfect for conversational style on radio, J.F.K. and Reagan for the big TV networks.

And you can tell yourself that. Somebody is reading some of these speeches. I just had an exchange with a columnist who I like, but it was on the topic of using the phrase radical Islam, and the criticism that is come from some of the Republicans. And this is a columnist who is generally sympathetic and a thoughtful person but actually thought that I was underestimating the importance of having this pithy phrase that includes Islam to accurately label the nature of the threat. And he said, Well, you acknowledge all these truths, but you do it in long paragraphs, and that is not sufficient. And I took the criticism to heart.

Gabby Giffords in a very emotional plea in the Senate hearing today on gun control said now is the time. Can Congress tackle both issues at the same time? And which one will have priority? Well, there is no doubt that Congress can tackle both. We have to get comprehensive immigration reform. It is been too long since we reformed the system. And we are starting to see a bipartisan consensus built around this. So we need to take the opportunity and we need to do it fast. As the Senators do their work, start identifying where there is some differences. We can provide some technical assistance. Will one be easier than the other? Well, my suspicion is we are seeing more bipartisan discussion on the immigration issue, than on the gun issue. But I also think that on the gun issue you are starting to see the gun owners, people who traditionally opposed gun control saying you know what, when 20 of our children are shot by somebody whose disturbed, and when it is that easy to get these high clip magazines that can fire off hundreds of shots in a few minutes, that it is time for us to do a better job on background checks. Both will end up generating some opposition and some strong opposition. But I am generally encouraged that the Senate seems to be having a serious conversation about these issues. You said in your speech that if Congress does not work in a timely manner on immigration reform you will send your own bill. And you will ask them to, in your own words, to vote on it right away. What to you is a timely manner? The Senate is supposed to introduce legislation by March. Well, you know if they can get a piece of legislation debated on the floor by March I think that is a good timeline. Keep in mind that most of these issues we have done work on already. We have a pretty good sense of the work we have already done on border security. We already know what would be required to earn a legal status and citizenship in terms of paying a fine and learning English. And going through background checks and paying back taxes. So a lot of this work has been done. So we have already drafted a bill.

On Friday, the SEC, headed by a chair you appointed, accused Goldman Sachs of securities fraud just as the financial regulation reform debate was heating up in the Senate. What do you say to people out there who say there was something fishy and political about that? Well, what I'd say is that I gave a speech about financial regulatory reform in 2007 before our current crisis, in 2008, before we fully knew what this crisis was going to be. We released financial reform as a package over a year ago. And so we are not Johnny-come-latelies to this thing. We have been pushing this hard throughout. And the SEC is an entirely independent agency that we have no day-to-day control over. And they have never discussed with us anything with respect to the charge that will be brought. So this notion that somehow there would be any attempt to interfere in an independent agency is completely false. So you can say categorically, no winks, no heads up in advance, no signal from anyone? We found out about it on CNBC. In the 2008 campaign, you got a lot of money, about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs. Your former White House counsel Greg Craig is apparently going to represent Goldman Sachs. In light of this case, do either of those things embarrass you? First of all, I got a lot of money from a lot of people. And the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country. And moreover, anybody who gave me money during the course of my campaign knew that I was on record, again, in 2007, 2008, pushing very strongly that we needed to reform how Wall Street did business. And so nobody should be surprised in the position that I am taking now, because it is one that I was very clear about during the course of the campaign. As far as my former White House counsel Greg Craig, he is one of the top lawyers in the country. He has a range of clients. But we have the toughest ethics rules that any president has ever had. And the one thing that he knows is is that he cannot talk to the White House, he cannot lobby the White House.

Since you are talking to the Christian Science Monitor, we are interested in your spiritual journey, which you have mentioned a couple times. And you have talked about how amazed you have been by the power of forgiveness, especially in the last 18 months. And I was wondering if you could share with us what your own spiritual growth has been. Have you found any concepts that you have held onto that have helped promote your own spiritual growth? Could you just describe what is been happening with your own growth in the last 18 months? Well, this is a subject I think people in public life should address with some amount of humility and reluctance, not because people should not be willing to affirm their faith but because we should remember the story that Christ told, in effect, bragging about the people that prayed in their closets instead of on the street corner. So I say that with all-but having said that, I think the thing that has struck me is that in this journey I have made to try to- that really has been a lifetime journey for me, and it is certainly something that is deepened since I have been President and something that I had to really focus on the last 2 years I think the thing that I have really had to work on is trying to gain some spiritual anchor that will enable me to give up resentments and disappointment and anger and to understand that in seeking forgiveness I had to learn to forgive. It is easy to ask for forgiveness. A lot of people think it is hard, but I think it is -when you plainly need it, it is easy enough to ask for. But we are taught over and over again that we cannot get it unless we give it. And I think what is-you know, there is the wonderful Scripture where people are admonished to forgive those not just in the same measure that they are forgiven but 70 times 7. I think that what I have gained more than anything else is a certain humility in recognizing how important forgiveness is, but how it does not count and it cannot count unless you can give it as well as ask for it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfrancinekieferandskipthurmanthechristiansciencemonitorboston", "title": "Interview With Francine Kiefer and Skip Thurman of the Christian Science Monitor in Boston", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-francine-kiefer-and-skip-thurman-the-christian-science-monitor-boston", "publication_date": "18-01-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Well, maybe the 8 years as Governor gave me some advance training for this, because I do remember that when I first became Governor there was a period that I went through in which I thought the world had fallen on my head. And yet, I have to say hat I think that the Presidency-the nearest thing to it in the country is a governorship. You do not have a foreign policy, which does add some problems, but it is the same thing. And it used to be-if you will look back at earlier days, in which our Presidents were mainly found among the Governors. And I think that is a better training place than, for instance, serving in the legislature or something. You'd still recommend it?

Tell me, would you recommend the job to a friend? He might not be a friend afterwards- -but, no, I have to say that for someone who really wants to do some things that he believes strongly in, this is the most fulfilling experience I have ever had in my life.

I am confident the Soviets will stick to their timetable and be out by the 15th of February, which will then be a great day for world peace. I am also confident about 1989 because in just 3 weeks George Bush will be sworn in as the 41st President of the United States. He has handled skillfully the selection of his Cabinet, and the transition process is proceeding well and smoothly. Of course, we still reel in shock and horror from the bombing of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and we extend our sympathy to the bereaved. The pledge we made to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one which George Bush shares. Indeed, President-elect Bush knows as thoroughly as anyone in the world today the nature and problem of terrorism. As chairman of this administration's task force on terrorism he oversaw a report that is the toughest statement to date on the need for strong action-including, when warranted, military action-against terrorists. That report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights right about now. That crime aside, however, there is little to disturb us about the overall state of the Nation as we join together to make merry and sing Auld Lang Syne. But still, during these days, when you turn on the television or read through the newspaper, you might get the idea that what faces George Bush upon his assumption of the responsibilities of the Presidency of the United States will be nothing but a series of impossible choices, heartaches, and just general trouble. Now, I am sure most of this talk is simply evidence that we are about to go through a change of leadership, a moment in time that does funny things to people, particularly in Washington.

For others, this is a time for the jitters because they try to imagine what the future will bring and find it a little confusing.

Look, we have heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with Acting Director McCabe later today to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the FBI -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI if he feels that that is necessary and appropriate.

Today 38 percent of all black children in the South go to majority white schools. Today only 28 percent of all black children in the North go to majority white schools. It came about because farsighted leaders in the South, black and white, some of whom I am sure did not agree with the opinions handed down by the Supreme Court which were the law of the land, recognized as law-abiding citizens that they had the responsibility to meet that law of the land, and they had dealt with the problem--not completely, there is more yet to be done. The recent decision of the Supreme Court presents some more problems, but I am confident that over a period of time those problems will also be handled in a peaceful and orderly way for the most part.

And when we were successful in bringing down inflation, one of the first things that happened was the nose-diving of that land. How about the other part of his criticism-the military pensions are bloated? I have to think this is a little different than any other pension program you want to name-the military. They go into a profession or a business-profession is the word; I guess it should be used-in which they know that, say, in a matter of a certain number of years, even though in any other line of activity they would be literally at their prime-your business or mine or anything else-but they know that the physical requirements are such that they are going to be out. Now, there is that coupled with the sacrifice that is made by the military. I talked to a retired military man-in this case he was an officer and reached high rank-and he had retired, and then he had found other employment. But he told me that one of the reasons-retiring was that in 31 years of his marriage-they sat one night and totted it up-20 years of the 31, they had been separated from each other, that he, in the call of duty, for 20 of his 31 married years had not been-he and his wife had not been together.

Tyrants- if tyrants do not fear-feel like they can torture and kill with impunity, feel like they can blackmail the world, and all the world does is put out empty words, it makes multilateralism extremely ineffective.

It is a dangerous-it inhibits the capacity for peace and freedom to spread. But what I have done is, I have convinced China and South Korea and Japan and Russia to speak with one voice to the North Koreans, and say, Get rid of your nuclear ambitions.

They do not seem to have any notion of how to get prosperity and growth. For 20 years the Republicans have been voting against almost everything the Democrats have done to help build this country up.

Said that we would refocus our attention on al-Qaida; we have. Made sure that made sure that we saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse; we have done that.

Can I ask you about taking out their top leadership, al-Awlaki, this guy, American-born terrorist? How important was he to al Qaeda? Do you what happened was we put so much pressure on al Qaeda in the Afghan/Pakistan region that their affiliates were actually becoming more of a threat to the United States. So Awlaki was their head of external operations. This is the guy that inspired and helped to facilitate the Christmas Day bomber. This is a guy who was actively planning a whole range of operations here in the homeland and was focused on the homeland. And so this was probably the most important al Qaeda threat that was out there after Bin Laden was taken out, and it was important that working with the enemies, we were able to remove him from the field.

I think on foreign policy, the concern I have right now is because we are in a nontraditional war. It is what we call the war on terrorism, although terrorism to some degree is a tactic. We are in a war against a non-state, a set of non-state actors that are operating in the shadows, are in nooks and crannies and crevices around the world. And what that means is that you are never going to have a scene of surrender like we had with the Emperor and Gen. MacArthur, where you do not have a clear start and finish to the use of force. The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having ENTITY do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in. So for example, we are still operating in our fight against ISIL without a new congressional authorization. It is the authorization that dates back to 9/11. And I think that is an area that we have to worry about. ENTITY and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. And what we have had to do on things like drones, or the NSA, or a number of the tools that we use to penetrate terrorist networks, what we have had to do is to build the guard rails internally. Essentially set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties. You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we have not gone far enough on that. I would argue that we have gotten it about right, although I am the first one to admit that we did not get it all right on day one. There were times where, for example, with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say You know what?

The White House staff knows very well what is expected of them. They are expected to focus on the people's business and they are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards.

Those issues are harder to find common ground on. But if we can get through this first period and arrive at a sensible package that reduces our deficits, stabilizes our debts, and involves smart reforms to Medicare and judicious spending cuts with some increased revenues and maybe tax reform, and you can get a package together that does not satisfy either Democrats or Republicans entirely, but puts us on a growth trajectory because it leaves enough spending on education, research and development, and infrastructure to boost growth now, but also deals with our long-term challenges on health care costs, then you can imagine the Republicans saying to themselves, OK, we need to get on the side of the American majority on issues like immigration. We need to make progress on rebuilding our roads and bridges. There are going to be some areas where that change is going to be very hard for Republicans. I suspect, for example, that already there are some Republicans who embrace the changing attitudes in the country as a whole around LGBT issues and same-sex marriage. But there is a big chunk of their constituency that is going to be deeply opposed to that, and they are going to have to figure out how they navigate what could end up being divisions in their own party. And that will play itself out over years. Are there any forces for reform within the Republican Party, people you have been able to establish some sort of working relationship with? Well, look, I have always believed that there are a bunch of Republicans of goodwill who would rather get something done than suffer through the sort of nasty atmosphere that prevails in Washington right now. It is not a fun time to be a member of Congress. And I think if you talk privately to Democrats and Republicans, particularly those who have been around for a while, they long for the days when they could socialize and introduce bipartisan legislation and feel productive. So I do not think the issue is whether or not there are people of goodwill in either party that want to get something done.

I believe there is enough people in the Palestinian Territories who are sick of the failures of the past, sick of broken promise. And yet they have yet to have something specifically defined around which they can rally. And so when I talk to Prime Minister Olmert, I listen very carefully to whether or not he is able to think beyond the moment. And I have come to the conclusion that, yes, he is a man of vision. He understands the significance of defining a hopeful state. And it is hopeful not just for the Palestinians, but it is hopeful for Israel as well. After all, he ran on a platform that said now, this is a major shift in Israeli policy; it started with Ariel Sharon, as you know which is two states, based upon the premise that liberty will bring peace. Now, of course, his concern is that the imposition of a state before certain conditions have been met that is why I say, subject to the roadmap. And the United States, as I said early, recognizes that there cannot be a state that harbors the desire to destroy its neighbor. No government can accept that, and I understand that. And so I trust Olmert. I do trust him. You trust Olmert, period? I trust him. I hope hopefully, he will say the same about me.

Few of us remember that it was Admiral Nimitz, as he was completing his career as Chief of Naval Operations in 1947, who recommended to the then Secretary of the Navy that the Bureau of Ships and the new Atomic Energy Commission get together to design and to build a nuclear propulsion plant for a submarine. Admiral Rickover took it from there. I see this great ship as a double symbol of today's challenging times. She is first of all a symbol of the United States, of our immense resources in materials and skilled manpower, of our inexhaustible energy, of the inventive and productive genius of our free, competitive economic system, and of our massive but controlled military strength.

It happened in part because of the power of truth. Czechoslovakia's playwright-President Vaclav Havel paid a very personal tribute to this power in his recent visit to Washington. First he came to the White House and told me personally what this broadcasting of the truth had meant to those who were fighting for freedom. And then he visited the Voice of America and met the employees of its Czech division. It was a very poignant encounter, for though Havel did not recognize any of them by face, he knew them all by name the instant he heard them speak. I am determined that America will continue to bear witness to the truth. America must never lose its voice. Just as President Havel and others who were once under Communist domination have thanked us, I am convinced that the people of Cuba will thank us when they, too, win the liberty they yearn for. Still, we can envision a time when the purpose of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty could be utterly fulfilled. But for now, these networks, along with USIA's WORLDNET and VOA, must continue in Eastern Europe until change is complete. We are still seeing the struggle for freedom, and this must continue until all that struggle is won by the forces of freedom. Free stations and newspapers are still struggling to take root. Their access to their Western colleagues is still erratic. We need to be there now more than ever before to describe and explain our own two centuries of experience in building a democracy. We can also assist the Eastern Europeans in sharing among themselves their own experience in democracy. they need to know how the process of reform is working with their neighbors. So, if one nation adopts a novel path to reform, pollution control, or currency law, the others need to be able to benefit from that experiment. And we must also look ahead to the challenges of a new century. To prepare for our future role, I have directed that an interagency review be conducted of U.S. Government international broadcasting.

I think those who believe that two years ago, or three years ago, there was some swift resolution to this thing had we acted more forcefully, fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the conflict in Syria and the conditions on the ground there. When you have a professional army that is well-armed and sponsored by two large states who have huge stakes in this, and they are fighting against a farmer, a carpenter, an engineer who started out as protesters and suddenly now see themselves in the midst of a civil conflict the notion that we could have, in a clean way that did not commit U.S. military forces, changed the equation on the ground there was never true. We have supported military assistance to a moderate opposition in Syria, and we have done so at a pace that stretches the limits of what they can absorb. But the fact of the matter is if you are looking at changing the military facts on the ground, the kind of involvement, the kind of involvement on the part of U.S. military forces that would have been required would have been significant enough that there would have been severe questions about our international authority to do so. You do not have a UN mandate; congressional authority we saw how that played out even on the narrow issue of chemical weapons. And there was the possibility that we would have made the situation worse rather than better on the ground, precisely because of U.S. involvement, which would have meant that we would have had the third, or, if you count Libya, the fourth war in a Muslim country in the span of a decade. Having said all that the situation in Syria is not just heartbreaking, but dangerous. Over the last two years I have pushed our teams to find out what are the best options in a bad situation. And we will continue to do everything we can to bring about a political resolution, to pressure the Russians and the Iranians, indicating to them that it is not in their interests to be involved in a perpetual war.

Do the events of this year suggest that it is getting even worse? I think that there has been a steady growth in people's cynicism about institutions generally, and government in particular. And some of it is justified because we have got a Congress that is been dysfunctional now for quite some time and cannot seem to organize itself to solve problems. You now have a Republican Congress, they control both chambers and they cannot even pass their own agenda, much less pass something that has bipartisan support. And at a time when there are a lot of big issues out there, people feel as if things are not working the way they should. Having said that, not all the cynicism is justified. Even without Congress cooperating, we have been able to make progress on a whole range of issues. And I think people are seeing that when government makes smart decisions, it actually has a significant impact. And part of my hope during the course of this election is that it is clarifying that people say, all right, here is what each party stands for, here is what each presidential candidate and various congressional candidates stand for.

But the job is not going to be finished for awhile. As you look at the projections out through the years, there is a lot yet to be done. But we have embarked on a different course. I can remember when the people on our side, the Republicans-and you realize I am talking the party not personal-over these years what needs to be done, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, the debate they engaged in was kind of a rearguard action on the part of the Republicans against the ever-increasing desire of government to spend, to intervene in the marketplace, to become even more powerful, and thus eventually oppressive on the people-much of what you have seen happen in your own country. The debate today in government is not that debate anymore-of the trying to hold back on that increase. The debate is both sides agreeing to reduced spending and reduced government, and the argument is only about how much to reduce it. I wondered, because of the decline in the oil price that would be little will benefit to the majority of countries in the world, but it will be to the detriment of two or three countries, like Mexico, Nigeria. I wonder whether you have at all considered the possibility of taking the advantages that the majority of the countries have accrued to them-could be used to sustain and help the countries that are suffering from the decline of the oil price. Well, we have been of help, and we have been with our contributions to the international banks, those funding agencies, but also in direct help. For example, as I told our friends and allies in the summit meeting at Versailles-the discussion of the Third World and our view is that you help them develop their own economies, not constantly be mendicants with their hands out waiting for someone to give them something. We, every year, buy more of the production of those countries than all the rest of the world put together. We think, also, that if we are able to alter the economic situation, that some of those same countries have the highest rates of inflation in the world, and thus even though it is going to be-there is going to be a temporary readjustment with those reduced revenues.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithhenrybrandonthelondonsundaytimesandnewsservicedomesticandforeign", "title": "Interview With Henry Brandon of the London Sunday Times and News Service on Domestic and Foreign Policy Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-henry-brandon-the-london-sunday-times-and-news-service-domestic-and-foreign", "publication_date": "18-03-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Now, there is Governors around the State, the country that have said, Look, give us the flexibility to be able to dovetail the Head Start program into our preschool programs so that all students-so we have a better control over whether or not the students are given the skills necessary so that when you hold us to account, we can achieve that which we want to achieve, which is excellence in the classroom.

In other words, what we really do not want to do is say we are going to focus on Head Start; the Head Start money goes for, you know, a prison complex. I know that will not happen with Governor Ehrlich, but there needs to be a guarantee that the Federal money spent on Head Start only go to Head Start. Secondly, States and local governments must put money into the program, which would lock in the Head Start money for Head Start. So, in other words, the flexibility given to the State would not allow the States budget flexibility. It is management flexibility to be able to take the Head Start program, dovetail into the preschool program, then the kindergarten program, and then into the elementary school program. Governors ought to have that flexibility to-hope that Congress will provide that flexibility so that when the accountability systems kick in, fully kick in, that a Governor can truthfully say, Well, I have had the tools necessary to make sure the Head Start program fits into an overall comprehensive plan for literacy and math for every child in the State of Maryland, in Governor Ehrlich's case.

And finally, we see an America where we refuse to pass on the debt we inherited to the next generation. Now, let me spend just a minute on this issue, because we have heard a lot of moralizing on the other side about this -- government spending and debt. Along with the tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they will stop government spending. Now, it is right to be concerned about the long-term deficit. If we do not get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it is time for government to show some discipline, too. But let us look at the facts. When these same Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down. These same Republicans turned a record surplus into a record deficit. When I walked in, wrapped in a nice bow was a $1.3 trillion deficit sitting right there on my doorstep. Just this year, these same Republicans voted against a bipartisan fiscal commission that they themselves had proposed. Once I decided I was for it, they were against it. And when you ask them what programs they'd actually cut they do not have an answer. Now, I will be honest -- I refuse to cut back on those investments that will grow our economy in the future -- investments in areas like education and clean energy and technology. I do not want to cut those things. And that is because economic growth is the single best way to bring down the deficit -- and we need these investments to grow. But I am absolutely committed to fiscal responsibility, which is why I have already proposed freezing all discretionary spending unrelated to national security for the next three years.

The American people as a whole want us to put this partisanship behind us, want us to get back to their business.

Not for the people who are out of work. I think that the way to think about it is the dangers of a second Big Recession are now much reduced; the danger of us tipping into a Great Depression, I think most economists would say, is not -- is not out there on the horizon. What is a danger is that we stay stuck in a new normal, where unemployment rates stay high. People who have jobs see their incomes go up, businesses make big profits; but they have learned to do more with less, and so they do not hire. And as a consequence, we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the 8 million jobs that were lost. So that is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. You know, one of the things I think you understand, as , is you are held responsible for everything, but you do not always have control over everything; and especially in an economy this big, there are limited tools to encourage the kind of job growth that we need. I am constantly reminded that we have been through worse times than these and we have always come out on top. You spent nearly a trillion dollars on the stimulus package; you have got short -- short-term interest rates are zero -- practically zero, and still the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. What can you do to create jobs that has not already been done? Some of this is going to be just a matter of the economy healing. There are some things we can do to accelerate growth. We still -- we have got a couple of trillion dollars worth of infrastructure improvements that need to be made around the country.

And frankly, that is what the American people expect. I mean, what you have been seeing in recent polling is, the American people agree with the approach that I have talked about a balanced approach. Even the majority of Republicans agree that it should not just be spending cuts; that those, like myself, who've been incredibly blessed and can afford to pay a little more, or oil companies that are doing very well and do not need the tax breaks that are currently in the tax code, that we have got to make some sacrifices as well to solve the problem. Well, let us talk a little bit more about those sacrifices, though. We have talked a lot about taxes and raising taxes, and the argument around that. But let us talk about it the other way. Specifically this plan, this bipartisan plan would trim the amount that goes into entitlement programs. Now, you have been saying everybody's got to give something... and you are willing to give up on some things that are important to other Democrats, to progressives. But what about what is your message to Democrats and perhaps I should say progressives who say that the most vulnerable people in this country have already suffered too much in recent years and gotten too little? Well, I think what is absolutely true is, is that core commitments that we make to the most vulnerable have to be maintained. And so a lot of the spending cuts that we are making should be around areas like defense spending, as opposed to food stamps. I do think that when it comes to entitlements, when we are talking about Social Security and Medicare, that those are not entitlement programs where people are not contributing; it would be that they are social insurance programs that people have been making contributions to, and they are the most important part of our social safety net so that when people retire, they can retire with dignity and respect. What is true is that given the rising number of seniors, and given the huge escalation in health-care costs, that if we do not structure those programs so that they are sustainable, then it is going to be hard for the next generation to enjoy those kinds same kinds of benefits. And so we are going to have to make some modest changes that retain the integrity of the program, but make sure that they are there for years to come.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmichelmartinnationalpublicradio", "title": "Interview With Michel Martin of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-michel-martin-national-public-radio", "publication_date": "22-07-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

During this brief period numerous local public agencies and private investors have applied for licenses to build hydro-electric plants. These applications in this Northwest region amount to nearly six million kilowatts. This represents a prospective investment of not less than one and one-half billion dollars. Well over half of this would be invested by public power--not private power--interests. But the seekers after Federal control of energy are not silenced even by this array of facts. They say that construction of power projects by local enterprise will impede the comprehensive development of this or other river basins. Now again--let us take a look at the facts. What they say just is not true. All power projects must be licensed by the Federal Power Commission. Before the Commission grants a license, it must see evidence that the project makes maximum use of the developed resources. It makes no difference who builds the projects-Federal, State, municipal, or private agencies. when a project is licensed before a non-Federal authority, it is not removed from public control. Rates and services remain under regulation. And when the licensing period ends, the site can be assumed by the Federal Government. that, here in the Northwest, your own public agencies and your own private companies--operating under both Federal regulation and your own eagle eyes out here--can work in the public interest at least as well as some far-off Federal agency. Through the Governors' Power Policy Committee, Governors Langlie, Patterson, Jordan, and Aronson are doing great work in assuring this area of adequate supplies of water. More benefits will flow from efforts to further inter-State cooperation on problems that cross the borders of the Northwestern States. I am especially happy that the power produced by this great new dam will contribute to the finest type of cooperative effort--your own Northwest Power Pool. This arrangement is an admirable modal of voluntary pooling of public and private generating and transmission facilities. Because of it, you citizens of the Northwest have hundreds of thousands of kilowatts of additional prime power that would not exist through independent operation of your various utilities. And in addition--and very important--you have it under your own control--not under the permission of a far-off Washington office holder.

Despite the obstructionists and the isolationists, we prepared our country against danger from abroad.

And while we were making the greatest of all military efforts, at the same time, the American people maintained their liberties, their living standards, and their social gains. We also continued the fight to expand our civil liberties by new measures against discrimination. After V-J Day, a Democratic Congress and a Democratic administration, working together, set out upon the great tasks remaining before us. We accomplished swift reconversion. We avoided a postwar recession, and reached a peak of more jobs, higher civilian production, and better standards of living than ever before. That is an accomplishment that nobody can appreciate. Not very much has been said about that, but we had no riots and no bloodshed. We did not have people crying for jobs. We did not have the farmers marching on Washington. We did not have returning soldiers marching on Washington, because we took care of them in educational institutions and absorbing them back into the economy of the country without a debacle. We enacted the Employment Act of 1946, pledging all our resources and efforts to the maintenance of prosperity. We brought the United States to a position of unquestioned leadership in world affairs. Do not let anybody tell you anything different. I repeat--for 16 years the Democratic administration has been working in the interest of all the people. For 14 of the 16 years, the Democratic president was supported by a Democratic Congress. We were able to go steadily forward in fulfilling our pledges to the people. And then--and then!--in 1946, something happened--something bad and dangerous to the country. That was the year of the congressional elections, when most of the people stayed home and failed to vote. Those who did vote gave you a Republican Congress--that notorious Republican 80th do-nothing Congress.

But our central security priority here is to make sure Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. That would not just be dangerous for us, but it'd be dangerous for Israel and dangerous for the world. And almost every nuclear expert who is looked at this deal has been persuaded that in fact this is the best way for us to assure ourselves and the world that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon because we shut down a whole bunch of their facilities, they ship out in rich uranium that they already have and they do so for at least a 15 year period, they cannot introduce advanced centre fusions that could produce weapons grade material and that does not mean that suddenly we have a good relationship with Iran. It does mean that we have taken off the table what poses a game changer, a great threat to us and we have done so without initiating a new military conflict in the Middle East.

An increasingly active, engaged, and responsible Japan is critical to a forward-looking post-cold-war community. This brings us to the second area of our relationship, our foreign policy cooperation. We must fulfill the bright promise of our global partnership. Together, we produce 40 percent of the world's gross national product. We contribute together 40 percent of all bilateral aid. We have the ability to marshal unrivaled resources to build a better future if our foreign policies are well coordinated. America has a responsibility here, but it is a responsibility we share with Japan. The upcoming conference on assistance to the nations of the former U.S.S.R., now the Commonwealth of Independent States, is a timely example of such foreign policy coordination. The collapse of the Soviet Union has also spurred questions within Japan about the durability of U.S.-Japan alliance. For decades, this alliance has stood as the bulwark of American-Japanese international cooperation. It is today every bit the linchpin of regional stability and bilateral cooperation that wise men foresaw years ago. The demise of the Soviet Union may confront us both with ominous dangers, but it also presents us an historic opportunity. The leadership Japan and other Asian nations can provide to help transform a once-totalitarian empire into market-oriented and democratic states helps guarantee the future peace and stability of our world. Let me add that with the changes in the former Soviet Union, the United States sees no reason why Japan should not regain the Northern Territories. We share this goal, and in whatever way we can, we will help you attain it. We cannot imagine meeting the foreign policy challenges of our time without Japan as a partner.

For anybody who has refinanced a home loan or refinanced a business loan or gotten a car loan, a consumer loan, a college loan at lower interest rates, a lot of people are going to in the middle class and even some upper income people are going to save more money on lower interest rates than they are going to pay in higher taxes.

Through our talks, we can help to reach a renewed recognition of the mutual importance of strong, constructive ties between India and the United States. In searching for words to describe the focus of your visit to Washington this week, I came upon a statement that you had made in Delhi when Roy Jenkins visited in 1980. And at that time, you said, The great need in the world today is to so define national interest that it makes for greater harmony, greater equality and justice, and greater stability in the world. Well, that is more than an eloquent description of enlightened national interest. It can also serve to describe the foundation of the relationship between the United States and India, a relationship we seek to reaffirm this week. A strengthening of that relationship, based on better understanding, is particularly important at this time. Your father once said that the basic fact of today is the tremendous pace of change in human life. The conflicts and the tensions of the 1980's pose new challenges to our countries and to all nations which seek, as India and the United States do, freedom in a more stable, secure, and prosperous world. As leaders of the world's two largest democracies, sharing common ideals and values, we can learn much from one another in discussing concerns and exploring national purposes. From this understanding can come greater confidence in one another's roles on the world's stage and a rediscovery of how important we are to one another. Prime Minister Gandhi, we recognize that there have been differences between our two countries, but these should not obscure all that we have in common, for we are both strong, proud, and independent nations guided by our own perceptions of our national interests. We both desire the peace and stability of the Indian Ocean area and the early end of the occupation of Afghanistan.

And in addition to that, our administration has worked very hard to give the States and the schools of this country and the young people of this country more educational opportunities, everything from getting kids off to a better start in school, to giving the school districts money for smaller classes, more computers, higher standards, to more scholarships and national service opportunities to pay for college education, to many, many more low-cost, easier repayment college loans.

As you no doubt know, the First Lady this past week was critical of the do not ask, do not tell policy. You were not going to institute that at the beginning of your Presidency, anyway.

I did not implement do not ask, do not tell until the Senate voted 68-32 against the policy that I wanted. For me, what is important is that the policy, as implemented, does not work as I announced it and as the leaders of our military at that time in '93 pledged to implement it. I can only hope this last brutal beating death of a gay soldier will give some sobering impetus to a reexamination about how this policy is implemented and whether we can do a better job of fulfilling its original intent. Let me remind you that the original intent was that people would not be rooted out; that they would not be questioned out; that this would be focused on people's conduct, and if they did not violate the code of conduct, and they did not tell, that their comings and goings, the mail they got, the associates they had, that those things would not be sufficient to kick them out of the military or certainly subject them to harassment.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollerandpetermaercbsradioorlandoflorida", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller and Peter Maer of CBS Radio in Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-and-peter-maer-cbs-radio-orlando-florida", "publication_date": "11-12-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I wonder, does this point to a failure of your economic policy or an inability of the administration to convey how it does feel? I think it is the latter and possibly the former, because people look at it and say, Hey, why cannot you get Congress to do what you want it to do? You did it in Desert Storm. The difference is I did not need Congress to move on Desert Storm, as you may well remember. So I think it is a combination of things. And I can understand when people are hurting that they feel that way, and a good thing happened on this polling, though. I vowed when the polls were sky-high not to live by the polls and saying I did not believe them.

We are ready, because we know the terrorists have more money and more men and more plans. The gravest danger to freedom lies at the perilous crossroads of radicalism and technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, along with ballistic missile technology-when that occurs, even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends, and we will oppose them with all our power. For much of the last century, America's defense relied on the cold war doctrines of deterrence and containment. In some cases, those strategies still apply, but new threats also require new thinking. Deterrence-the promise of massive retaliation against nations-means nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or citizens to defend. Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist allies. We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. We cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants who solemnly sign nonproliferation treaties and then systemically break them. Homeland defense and missile defense are part of stronger security; they are essential priorities for America. Yet, the war on terror will not be won on the defensive. We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans, and confront the worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action, and this Nation will act. Our security will require the best intelligence to reveal threats hidden in caves and growing in laboratories. Our security will require modernizing domestic agencies such as the FBI, so they are prepared to act and act quickly against danger. Our security will require transforming the military you will lead, a military that must be ready to strike at a moment's notice in any dark corner of the world.

I think John Boehner genuinely wanted to get a deal done, but it was hard to do in part because his caucus is more conservative probably than most Republican leaders are, and partly because he is vulnerable to attack for compromising Republican principles and working with Obama. The same dynamic happens on the Democratic side. And I think at least leaders like myself-and I include Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi in this-are willing to buck the more absolutist-wing elements in our party to try to get stuff done. You inspired a lot of people in your first presidential campaign, and with your books, by talking about a new kind of politics. And now, four years later, it is a time in Washington that is characterized by nastiness more often that not. How do you reconcile those two things four years in? I believe that what I talked about in 2008 is still where the country is. And it describes my real-world view of how politics should work. I have always been suspicious of absolutism. I have always been suspicious of ideological litmus tests. I am not somebody-when I look back on American history-who believes that one party has got a monopoly on wisdom. So I guess the issue is not that the concept in 2008 was wrong. I think the issue is that we have these institutional barriers that prevent what the American people want from happening. Some of them are internal to Congress, like the filibuster in the Senate. Some of them have to do with our media and what gets attention. Nobody gets on TV saying, I agree with my colleague from the other party. People get on TV for calling each other names and saying the most outlandish things. Even on issues like the response to Hurricane Sandy, Chris Christie was getting hammered by certain members of his own party and media outlets for cooperating with me to respond to his constituents. That gives you an indication of how difficult I think the political environment has become for a lot of these folks.

We share common purposes, common ideals, common hopes, and a common future. This has been especially true during the last 8 years, since Mr. Nouira because Prime Minister of Tunisia. I think among all those nations who have had a close economic aid relationship with the United States, Tunisia has excelled in the rapid technological and economic development among their people. They have made full and increasing use of the great natural resources and human resources of their country. And along with this economic development has come a very rapid evolution into a leadership role among the developing nations of the world, the Arab community, and within the United Nations especially.

Tunisia is recognized as having a government and leaders that are at the same time practical and effective and idealistic and never deviating from proper principles of government. This leadership under Prime Minister Nouira and President Bourguiba has also been exemplified by great courage. As a member of the Arab nation community, as far back as 1965, President Bourguiba called for a recognition of Israel, its right to exist, its right to be recognized as a nation. We have received good advice, good counsel, good support from Tunisia during our own times of effort to bring peace to the Middle East and to the northern portion of the continent of Africa.

And as I said yesterday in the press conference, that this really undermines the argument for the Iranians because if, in fact, their only focus is on civilian nuclear power, they readily accept the plant, the fuel, and the offer of Russia to pick up the spent fuel. So there are areas where we cooperate, and there are areas where we have disagreements.

And he, in not only his body language, but in his words to me that Medvedev is going to be in charge of foreign policy. I think it is I will take him for his word, and then we will watch and see what happens. How concerned are you about issues like human rights in Russia?  I think it matters when people speak up, whether it be in Russia or China or anywhere else. In Russia's case, there was early on in my Presidency, I remember talking to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Catholic Church, where there were concerns about the Church being able to have a robust presence. Vladimir Putin is sensitive to religious issues. He has a beautiful little Orthodox church on his own property, which he proudly showed me and Laura one time. He made sure I met some of the Jewish community when I was there in Russia. And so he is sensitive to religious liberty, more so than some other countries. And is Western leverage reduced by the fact that Russia has a good chunk of the world's natural energy resources? I think it certainly changes the equation on a lot of foreign policy.

The Northwest now has a lot of difficult natural resource issues. For example, if you cut all the old-growth forests, you can keep people working for a while, and then you will not have any left at all. You will have lost a lot of not only the biological species there, but there will be more water pollution and the salmon fishermen will be hurt. A lot of these things are very, very complicated. We are going to try to resolve them the best we can and make a recommendation that will preserve as much of the old-growth forests as we can, recognize the importance of maintaining responsible logging practices, and keep the salmon fishers going, and doing as much of those things as we can to balance the economy and the environment. I understand a little about this because I live in a State that is over half timberland with a lot of national forest land. Probably no one will be happy with the recommendations that our administration will make. But we are going to do our best to be fair and to look at the long view.

Well, the whole issue of free campaign time from the broadcast networks arose, frankly, as a result of the opposition that some folks have in any public funding of campaigns. I presented a campaign finance reform law to the Congress which lowers the cost of campaigns, lowers the cost of political action committees, and gives people who are candidates for office communications vouchers so they can have access to the airwaves, so the challengers as well as the incumbents, and without regard to party, can have access to the airwaves.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithconniechunganddanrathercbsnews", "title": "Interview With Connie Chung and Dan Rather of CBS News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-connie-chung-and-dan-rather-cbs-news", "publication_date": "27-05-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

As you know, it costs us about $3 billion a year because of national security expenditures. So that this goes to the heart of our ability to keep more than one million Americans in uniform who now are serving the United States outside the borders of the United States. So that I think this is a very vital issue, and that is why I was particularly pleased that Mr. Herter accepted it. I am glad to see in this New York Port Authority, the trade center that they are building, the effort that businesses are making to sell abroad. As a percentage of our gross national product the United States sells abroad less than really almost any major industrialized country. We have never had before us the prospect of export or die, and I think that if all those who are in positions of responsibility will think not only of the markets which may be abroad for investment, but also going up and down the streets and selling American products, they can make a decisive contribution to the maintenance of our balance of payments, and also serve the country and the free economy system. So the next few months I think will be very decisive and the burdens of Mr. Herter will be very great. in view of the prospect for a deficit in any event, and a fairly large one if taxes are reduced, is it part of the administration's plan to finance a major part of that deficit outside the banking system in order to reduce the threat of monetary inflation? That will be a judgment which is primarily that of Mr. Martin and the Federal Reserve. He has commented on that to a degree before the Joint Committee this year. He is concerned about the prospect of inflation, because of course it affects us adversely, and also because it affects the balance of payments. I would hope, however, and I am sure that he will agree, that he will any deficit which has to be financed will be financed in a way which will be the maximum degree possible to stimulate the economy without increasing the prospect of another inflationary or speculative spiral.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressandquestionandanswerperiodtheeconomicclubnewyork", "title": "Address and Question and Answer Period at the Economic Club of New York.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-and-question-and-answer-period-the-economic-club-new-york", "publication_date": "14-12-1962", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

Our kids are spending less time outside and more time on the couch in front of the TV, video games, the Internet. At school, gym classes, recess, they have been eliminated or shortened. Portion sizes in this country have ballooned. In some areas, families are having a tougher time getting regular access to fresh produce. And kids these days are consuming more calories and eating more fat and sugar than ever before. We want to solve the problem of childhood obesity in a generation, so that kids born today can reach adulthood at a healthy weight. And Let us Move! is about attacking this problem from all different angles. It is about giving parents the information and the resources they need to make healthy decisions for their families. It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice. And the truth is that while restaurants are offering more options and families take advantage of them more often, they are not always the healthiest choices. Research has shown that kids consume more saturated fat and less fiber and calcium when they eat out. And the meals they eat at restaurants have twice as many calories as the ones they eat at home. Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently. But when stores and restaurants do not offer healthy options, or when parents do not have the information to make the best choices for their families, that is easier said than done. And as America's restaurant owners, you are responsible for one-third of the calories our kids get on a daily basis. The choices you make determine what is listed on the menus, what is advertised on billboards, and what is served on our plates.

Third, we are tightening security on our airplanes and at our Nation's airports. From now on, we will hand-search more luggage and screen more bags and require preflight inspections for any plane flying to or from the United States. I have asked Vice President Gore to head an effort to deploy new high-technology inspection machines at our airports and to review all our security operations. We will continue to press forward on all three of these fronts. But we cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our country and the safety of our people. That is exactly what the Republican majority in Congress did by stripping from the antiterrorism legislation key provisions that law enforcement needs to help them find out, track down, and shut down terrorists. Law enforcement has asked for wiretap authority to enable them to follow terrorists as they move from phone to phone. This is the only way to track stealthy terrorists as they plot their crimes. This authority has already been granted to our law enforcement officials when they are dealing with organized criminals. Surely it is even more urgent to give them this authority when it comes to terrorists. And law enforcement has also asked that explosives used to make a bomb be marked with a taggant, a trace chemical or a microscopic plastic chip scattered throughout the explosives. This way sophisticated machines can find bombs before they explode, and when they do explode police scientists can trace a bomb back to the people who actually sold the explosive materials that led to the bomb. In Switzerland over the past decade it is helped to identify who made bombs and explosives in over 500 cases. When it was being tested in our country several years ago, it helped police to find a murderer in Maryland. In the last 2 weeks since the Olympic bombing, our law enforcement officers have been working around the clock, but they have been denied a scientific tool that might help to solve investigations like this one. Our antiterrorism bill would have given us the ability to require tagging gunpowder often used in making pipe bombs.

Over the next few years I reckon I will be spending a lot of time in what Teddy Roosevelt called the great cathedral of the outdoors, and I cannot wait. I will remember what we have tried to do to conserve it, to preserve it, and I am very proud of our team's efforts. Everyone is and should be, whatever age, interested in the environment. And my own conviction, or environmental policy, if you will, was born out of the concerns of a President, an outdoorsman, and maybe most of all, a grandfather. Our approach signaled a step beyond command-and-control regulation toward a more market-oriented, decentralized philosophy of environmental action. Those who said we posed a false choice between a strong economy and a safer environment just did not get it, just missed the point. We sought to achieve both while sacrificing neither. And we combined a pragmatism about human nature with an idealism about Mother Nature, an ambitious agenda that harnessed the energy of capitalism in the service of the environment. Now, excuse me, as I say, if I take pride in listing a few accomplishments that we pass on to a new generation. The Clean Air Act, with the help of Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, we broke 10 years of congressional gridlock by pushing through the world's most protective and cost-effective clean air legislation. And we have already proposed or finalized rules that promise to get at 85 percent of the pollution reductions that are targeted in this law. Reilly's clapping for himself, and I do not blame him. We won major funding shifting to environmental programs increasing the EPA's budget, I believe it was almost 50 percent; increasing funding for clean energy research and development by 66 percent. We enlisted the private sector in the voluntary pollution prevention efforts that are reshaping American industries, making us leaner, more efficient, and reducing toxic pollution by hundreds of millions of pounds a year. On the law enforcement front, we broke new ground and old records, filing more cases, collecting more penalties, and putting more polluters behind bars than every previous administration in history combined. We helped make America's great outdoors even greater, securing over a billion dollars to expand parks and wetlands and wildlife refuges, campgrounds and scenic rivers.

And I think that that kind of approach is sensible. But what I have also said is let us just make sure that, you know, we are open-minded.

Well, this is something that keeps me awake at night. There is no doubt that we have got a serious problem in terms of our long-term deficit and debt. I make no apologies for having acted short-term to deal with our recession. I think the vast majority of economists, conservative and liberal, felt that extraordinary interventions were necessary to prevent us from slipping into a potentially deep depression. But as soon as this economy recovers, and that means planning now and starting to take some steps now to deal with it, we are going to have to close that gap between the amount of money coming in and the money amount of money going out. I have said before and I will repeat, I believe that we can reform entitlements in a way that makes it more sustainable. But most experts will tell you that the biggest driver of those deficits is health care costs.

He is still going to get the contributions, and we still know where he is, and we know what is at stake, and we are going to elect him in November, so it does not make any difference. One thing you know about Bob Torricelli is that he will stand up and fight for you with every fiber of his being. He does not do anything halfway; he is full of passion.

{"id": 5217, "text": "But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, the State of California has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in 1975. Patients in that State see their claims settled a third faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since 1975, insurance premiums for California doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most States. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the Congress ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, Congress needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. 160 docs leave 2 counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on election day about medical liability. The House passed a good medical liability reform bill last year. I want to thank the two Members of Congress for working on it. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the American people. Both Houses will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the House to get the bill moving. It is important for the United States Senators from this State and other States to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in the year 2005.

{"id": 389, "text": "He was prudent in exercising judicial power and firm in defending judicial independence. On the bench and as a leader of the Federal courts, Chief Justice Rehnquist was always a calm and steady presence. In his thinking and in his bearing, he personified the ideal of fairness, and people could sense it. Inside the Court, no man could have been a finer steward of the institution, its customs, and its history. As long as William Rehnquist was presiding, colleagues and advocates knew that the proceedings would be orderly, on time, businesslike, and occasionally humorous. Once during an oral argument, a lawyer criticized his opponent's position by saying, I doubt very much it will fool this Court. The Chief Justice replied, Do not overestimate us. In his time on the Court, William Rehnquist served with 16 other justices, and by all accounts, each one of his colleagues regarded the man with respect and affection. Justice William Brennen once said to a visitor, I cannot begin to tell you how fond all of us are of him personally. Throughout this city of government, people saw William Rehnquist in that same way. He carried himself with dignity but without pretense. Like Ronald Reagan, the President who elevated him to Chief Justice, he was kindly and decent, and there was not an ounce of self-importance about him. It is rare that it is a rare man who can hold a prominent position in Washington, DC, for more than 30 years and leave behind only good feelings and admiration. That is what William Rehnquist did. His law clerks knew him as a demanding boss who pressed them, as one said, to read carefully, write clearly, and to think hard. But the clerks also became an extension of the Chief's family, joining him for walks around the Capitol, or for lunch or dinner, or games of tennis or charades. His clerks remember those times with fondness. And even more, they remember his vast store of knowledge and his daily example of clear thinking and character. To work beside William Rehnquist was to learn how a wise man looks at the law and how a good man looks at life. The Chief Justice was devoted to his public duties but not consumed by them. He was a renaissance man, a man who adored his family, a man who always kept things in balance. He read works of history and wrote a few fine ones of his own.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefuneralserviceforchiefjusticetheunitedstateswilliamhrehnquist", "title": "Remarks at the Funeral Service for Chief Justice of the United States William H.

I want to remind people that when we first put out the Container Security Initiative, the CSI, which was a new way to secure our ports, UAE was one of the first countries to sign up.

Today is Armed Forces Day and, on behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to offer them our thanks and appreciation. Their job is unusually difficult not only because it involves hardship and danger, or because it requires long periods away from families and loved ones, or even because it may demand the giving of one's life in defense of our nation. The difficulty of the military profession grows out of all of these, plus the fact that our service men and women are always faced with several of the most fundamental questions we ask as individuals and as a nation the questions of war and peace and the use of force in the world. Americans have asked these questions again and again for more than 200 years. They are still debating them today. The answers lie in seeming paradoxes, underlying truths that may appear contradictory on the surface. The most fundamental paradox is that if we are never to use force, we must be prepared to use it and to use it successfully. We Americans do not want war and we do not start fights. We do not maintain a strong military force to conquer or coerce others. We want to prevent war by deterring others from the aggression that causes war. If our efforts are successful, we will have peace and never be forced into battle. That is the paradox of deterrence. The men and women in our Armed Forces also live with a second paradox. They spend their entire time in service training to fight and preparing for a war which we and they pray will never come. As individuals, these men and women want peace as much as we do as a nation. In fact, they want it even more, because they understand that war is not the romantic heroism we read about in novels or see in the movies, but the stark truth of suffering and sacrifice and the slain promise of youth. Our service men and women know firsthand the horrors of war and the blessings of peace, but they also know that just wanting peace is not enough to guarantee that peace will be sustained. As George Washington said, To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual ways of preserving peace. Today, Americans are again asking important questions about war and peace. How could we prevent nuclear war, and how could we reduce American and Soviet nuclear arsenals? The answers to these questions are not found in simple slogans, but again, in paradoxes. To prevent nuclear war, we must have the capability to deter nuclear war.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationtheobservancearmedforcesday", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on the Observance of Armed Forces Day", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-the-observance-armed-forces-day", "publication_date": "21-05-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And when my grandfather came back, he was able to go to college on the GI bill, and they were able to buy a home through the FHA. And then, I thought about my single mom because my dad left when I was very young and how, despite all the struggles, she was able to get a great education because that is the kind of country this was.

We do have some obligations here. We have to make sure that our workers are the best prepared, the best trained in the world. Without regard to NAFTA, we know now that the average 18-year-old American will change jobs eight times in a lifetime. The Secretary of Labor has told us, without regard to NAFTA, that over the last 10 years, for the first time, when people lose their jobs most of them do not go back to their old job; they go back to a different job. So that we no longer need an unemployment system, we need a reemployment system. And we have to create that. We have to tell American workers who will be dislocated because of this agreement, or because of things that will happen regardless of this agreement, that we are going to have a reemployment program for training in America. And we intend to do that. Together, the efforts of two administrations now have created a trade agreement that moves beyond the traditional notions of free trade, seeking to ensure trade that pulls everybody up instead of dragging some down while others go up. We have put the environment at the center of this in future agreements. We have sought to avoid a debilitating contest for business where countries seek to lure them only by slashing wages or despoiling the environment. This agreement will create jobs, thanks to trade with our neighbors. That is reason enough to support it. But I must close with a couple of other points. NAFTA is essential to our longterm ability to compete with Asia and Europe. Across the globe our competitors are consolidating, creating huge trading blocs. This pact will create a free trade zone stretching from the Arctic to the tropics, the largest in the world, a $6.5 billion market with 370 million people. It will help our businesses to be both more efficient and to better compete with our rivals in other parts of the world. This is also essential to our leadership in this hemisphere and the world. Having won the cold war, we face the more subtle challenge of consolidating the victory of democracy and opportunity and freedom. For decades, we have preached and preached and preached greater democracy, greater respect for human rights, and more open markets to Latin America.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesigningceremonyforthesupplementalagreementsthenorthamericanfreetrade", "title": "Remarks at the Signing Ceremony for the Supplemental Agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-ceremony-for-the-supplemental-agreements-the-north-american-free-trade", "publication_date": "14-09-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Many in the press agreed. One columnist in the Washington Post said, The fact is that the conduct of the Korean war has been shot through with errors great and small. It is bleeding, and there is no cure for it in sight. He said that the American people could not understand why Americans are doing about 95 percent of the fighting in Korea. Many of these criticisms were offered as reasons for abandoning our commitments in Korea. And while it is true the Korean war had its share of challenges, the United States never broke its word. Today, we see the result of a sacrifice of people in this room in the stark contrast of life on the Korean Peninsula. Without Americans' intervention during the war and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime. The Soviets and Chinese Communists would have learned the lesson that aggression pays. The world would be facing a more dangerous situation. Instead, South Korea is a strong, democratic ally of the United States of America. South Korean troops are serving side by side with American forces in Afghanistan and in Iraq. And America can count on the free people of South Korea to be lasting partners in the ideological struggle we are facing in the beginning of the 21st century. For those of you who served in Korea, thank you for your sacrifice, and thank you for your service. This is a complex and painful subject for many Americans. The tragedy of Vietnam is too large to be contained in one speech. So I am going to limit myself to one argument that has particular significance today. The argument that America's presence in Indochina was dangerous had a long pedigree. In 1955, long before the United States had entered the war, Graham Greene wrote a novel called The Quiet American. It was set in Saigon, and the main character was a young Government agent named Alden Pyle. He was a symbol of American purpose and patriotism and dangerous naivete. I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused. After America entered the Vietnam war, the Graham Greene argument gathered some steam.

He has called the countries serving alongside us in Iraq, quote, a trumped-up coalition of the bribed, the coerced, the bought, and the extorted. He has dismissed the sacrifice of 14 nations that have lost forces in Iraq, calling those nations window dressing. Great Britain, Australia, and the United States. He left out Poland, one of the first countries to see combat on the first days of hostilities in Iraq. He never shows respect for some of the 30 nations that are serving courageously in Iraq today. Senator Kerry even has disregarded the contributions of Iraqis who are fighting for their freedom. When he speaks of coalition casualties in Iraq, he does not count the hundreds of Iraqis who have given their lives fighting the terrorists and the insurgents. When Iraq's Prime Minister came to Washington to address Congress last month, Senator Kerry did not show up. Instead, he called a press conference and questioned the Prime Minister's credibility. The Prime Minister of Iraq is a brave man who survived the assassins of Saddam. The Prime Minister of Iraq deserves the respect of the world, not the scorn of a politician. As part of his foreign policy, Senator Kerry has talked about applying a global test. Before we act to defend ourselves, he thinks we need permission from foreign capitals. Yet, even the gulf war coalition in 1991 did not pass Senator Kerry's global test. Even with the United Nations approval, he voted against removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. If that vast, U.N.-supported operation did not pass his test, nothing ever could.

It makes sure that we actually start bending the cost curve, controlling the rising premiums by instituting better practices in terms of how we reimburse doctors and how we ask hospitals to work together. We have already invested in electronic IT, electronic medical records, things that can help make the system more efficient. So we have this enormous opportunity.

You have to remember one great difference about our country. A man put it to me in a letter once. And that is that you could leave here and go to France to live, but you could not become a Frenchman; or you could go to live in Germany or Turkey or-name any country-you could not become one of them; this is the only country in the world in which anyone from any corner of the world can come here and become an American, because that is our history.

So, the result is that the people that came here came not only with the desire for freedom, but they also brought with them many of the prejudices that existed because of national differences between various countries. People may have and do have-there are people who have a prejudice against someone of another faith, someone of another background or race.

Most private plans absolutely cover it. But no insurance plan specifically mentioned any surgical procedure.

As it relates to PPP, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the Treasury some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get five percent on a $50,000 loan, that is a lot less than getting one percent on a $5 million loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do.

One of the challenges that we have been talking about now is the way social media and the Internet have changed what people receive as news. I was just talking to my political director, David Simas. He was looking at his Facebook page and some links from high school friends of his, some of whom were now passing around crazy stuff about, you know, Obama has banned the Pledge of Allegiance. I think it is really important for us, as progressives to set aside the Democratic Party as an institution, but just anybody who wants to see a more progressive America to think about how we are operating on the ground and showing up everywhere and fighting for the support of folks and giving them a concrete sense of what it is that we think will make their lives better, rather than depending on coming up with the right technocratic policies and sharing that with the New York Times editorial board. If we are not on the ground, and people are not hearing and seeing us face-to-face, then we will keep on losing, even though I genuinely believe that the Republican prescriptions are not going to be as helpful to these folks. So what do you think is the future of the Democratic Party? A month ago, everybody was convinced that the GOP was in its final death throes; now you have got three branches of government in the hands of one party. You have got voter suppression, which is guaranteed to continue, you have got redistricting, all these things. If you survey the American people, including Trump voters, they are in favor of a higher minimum wage. They are in favor, in large numbers, of decriminalizing marijuana. They, I think, are, increasingly and with shocking speed, accepting of the need to treat the LGBT community with respect. They are hugely suspicious of Wall Street, hugely suspicious of the Establishment. Part of what Trump did, as well as Bernie, was run against that Establishment. Now the irony, of course, is that one would think Trump would be considered part of that Establishment and not a genuine outsider like Bernie was.

With the opening of the twentieth century, and the great increase of population and commerce, and the growth of a more complex type of litigation, similar proposals were introduced in the Congress. To meet the situation, in 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916, the Attorneys General then in office I will end the suspense by saying that it was McReynolds and Gregory recommended to the Congress that when a district or a circuit judge failed to retire at the age of seventy, an additional judge be appointed in order that the affairs of the court might be promptly and adequately discharged. In 1919 a law was finally passed providing that ENTITY may appoint additional district and circuit judges, but only upon a finding that the incumbent judge over seventy is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of mental or physical disability of permanent character. The discretionary and indefinite nature of this legislation has rendered it ineffective. No President should be asked to determine the ability or disability of any particular judge. The duty of a judge involves more than presiding or listening to testimony or arguments. And I go on and talk about the complexity of the modern average case, that it has increased tremendously in the last twenty or twenty-five years. Modern complexities call also for a constant infusion of new blood in the courts, just as it is needed in executive functions of the Government and in private business. A lowered mental or physical vigor leads men to avoid an examination of complicated and changed conditions. Little by little, new facts become blurred through old glasses fitted, as it were, for the needs of another generation; older men, assuming that the scene is the same as it was in the past, cease to explore or inquire into the present or the future. We have recognized this truth in the civil service of the nation and of many states by compelling retirement on pay at the age of seventy. We have recognized it in the ENTITY and Navy by retiring officers at the age of sixty-four. A number of states have recognized it by providing in their constitutions for compulsory retirement of aged judges. it was not intended to create a static judiciary.

America's children would bear the most pain from the sharp cuts proposed by the Republican Congress. health care they now have, schooling they can count on, school lunches, a safe place to live, or air and water we can be sure is safe to breathe and to drink. Just consider what would happen to Medicaid. For three decades, Medicaid has been a legal guarantee for millions who need medical care. It has been the primary source of health care for nearly one in five American children. And more than half of the children on Medicaid live in families with working parents. But the Republican plan repeals Medicaid's guarantees, and that spells disaster for families in the middle class who are caught unprepared. Medicaid helps millions of children who are disabled or who suffer from chronic illnesses or who have the ENTITY virus. But the Republican plan could pull this lifeline from millions of children. In education, the Republican plan eliminates Head Start for 180,000 preschoolers. It cuts our efforts to keep drugs and violence out of our schools. It undermines our efforts to help schools meet national standards of excellence for the first time. It kills the AmeriCorps national service program. It denies scholarships to more than 350,000 deserving college students and takes away the best student loan program available to young people-it lowers the cost and eases the terms of repayment. The Republican plan would raise taxes for over 7 million of our hardest pressed working families. Their budget cuts would leave children exposed to hazardous waste. And we know that pollution affects children more than it does adults. We want to clean up these sites, but the Republican cuts would limit what we can do. The Republican budget cuts are aimed squarely at our children. They will face larger classes and fewer Head Start programs. Ten million will live near toxic waste sites that will not be cleaned. Millions will be denied adequate medical care. And more than one million will be forced into poverty. That is no way to treat our children. Let them threaten to shut the Government down.

He understands that we have got to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid medical and family leave. When a woman in America gives birth, she should not be forced to go back to work after one or two weeks. When a child gets sick, Mom or Dad should be able to stay home, take care of that kid, and not lose a day's pay. I want everybody to hear it because it is not been talked about enough.

Joe also understands that one out of five Americans who walk into their doctor's office and gets a prescription, they cannot afford to fill that prescription because of the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in this country.

But the point they were making is that the biomedical advances that would flow out of the human genome project, which the Republican majority will support lavishly, depended upon the development of the computer technology, and that without the development of the computer technology, you could never parse something as small as the human genome and get into all these genes and understand all the permutations. For example, there was a fascinating article the other day about one of the implications of the human genome, saying that talking about these two women who had a form of cancer, and that basically, if you look at the historical studies of all women in this category with this kind of cancer, diagnosed at this point in their illness, that you would say they had a 45-percent chance of survival. But now they can do genetic testing showing that they actually have very different conditions, and that one of them had a 20-percent chance of survival, the other had an 80-percent chance of survival. Now, the reason they can do that is because not only of the biological advances but the nonbiological advances that make it possible to measure the biological differences.

And sometimes, we look back at those initial years of its use as... like we maybe misused or overused that technology. Are you at all worried that your administration is going to be seen as a time when drone strikes were a technology like -- that we see as over or misused? Well, you know, basically, drone technology came into its own right when I first came into office. We have tried to put a series of constraints on how it is used. But understand that our goal has always been, how do we target very specific terrorists who are, you know, proven to be trying to kill us? Or, more frequently, kill innocent Muslims in their home countries? And how do we do that with -- with as little damage to the surrounding communities and innocent people as possible? You know, part of what is really tough for me as commander in chief is the fact that any kind of war is damaging. Any kind of war results in casualties. And, in fact, the sort of damage that may have taken place with a drone strike is always significantly less than if I ordered a raid into a village where a high-value terrorist target was. So, you take the bin Laden operation in Pakistan, for example. You know, there were some people killed in that operation.

And I want you to know that I am joined here today by private sector leaders who are part of our national call to action. Hundreds of organizations, including all 32 tribal colleges, have answered this pledge. And I want to highlight just some of the public and private commitments being made to benefit the Navajo Nation and Native Americans all across our country. First, and very important, our Federal Communications Chairman, Bill Kennard, is proposing to expand the Lifeline program to ensure that every Native American who needs it will be able to get basic phone service for as little as $1 a month. In this day and age, when we want every American to have access to the Internet, we must first make sure that every American has access to a phone, so there will be a line to hook into. Second, Native American Systems, headed by Robert Rutherford, a Choctaw, is committing $100,000 state-of-the-art satellite communications to the Red Rock Day School, to provide equipment to 30 other BIA schools in other parts of Indian country. Tachyon is providing satellite Internet access to Dine College and the Lake Valley School. Compaq will provide $500,000 to spur the TechCorps schools partnership, which uses the Internet and TechCorps volunteers to help teachers make the best use of technology in the classroom. Four Navajo Nation schools participated in the pilot of TechCorps schools. Today I am proud to say that this new commitment will make it available to all Navajo Nation schools and all K-through-12 schools nationwide for Native Americans. Microsoft will provide $2.75 million in software and technical support for the American Indian Tribal College program, which will directly benefit Dine College. Andersen Consulting has committed $100,000 to support small business in Indian country, something we need more of.

You all face these kind of decisions all the time. But I do want to say, you will see a lot of our differences aired publicly the executive, the Congress, the parties within the Congress. But this budget is well within reach. This is well within reach. And it is well within reach in a way that also would permit us to create a bipartisan process to deal with the long-term challenges of the entitlements in Medicare and Social Security as well. So you should feel positive about that. But my advice would be here and my appeal to you is to tell every one of us, every time you get a chance to say it, that you cannot celebrate Thanksgiving this year without a balanced budget. If you do not , it will have a destructive impact on the markets. If you do, it will have a positive one. But you should know, when you hear all the debates, it is in the nature of the things for the differences to be amplified. The fact is that we are well within range of being able to get this done if we will all just hunker down and kind of turn down the rhetoric and treat each other with good faith. We can get this job done in a way that I think is very good for the economy. Let me just mention two other things I'd like to ask for your help on. The first is to help in getting a budget out and in supporting a policy in both parties that fulfills our responsibilities in the world today as the world's indispensable nation. We had a bipartisan foreign policy during most of the cold war because we knew our neck was on the line, and politics stopped at the water's edge. Now it is more difficult to build a bipartisan foreign policy because the elements of it are more diverse. For example, economic policy and trade has a lot more to do with it than previously, or at least we are aware that it does I think it was always a big part of our foreign policy and because no one perceives that our neck is on the line.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthebusinesscouncil0", "title": "Remarks to the Business Council", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-business-council-0", "publication_date": "27-02-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I told Hillary when we were sitting here that I never quite get into the spirit of Christmas until I come here to the Pageant of Peace. America's Christmas tree is famous all over the world. Believe it or not, there is even a new movie in Japan about two people who came to Washington and fell in love under this Christmas tree. We come here tonight to celebrate that magic, to rejoice in the spirit of the holiday season, no matter what our faith, a spirit of sharing and giving, of gathering with family and friends and coming together as one community. You can see it everywhere at this time of year. And of course, at Christmas we come together especially to celebrate the birth of a child who came into the world without a home, only a stable's roof to shelter him, who grew to teach the lesson of love and peace that has truly changed the world. Blessed are the peacemakers, he said, and those words still call us to action. As we look around the world tonight, we know the spirit of peace is strong enough to triumph over the forces that still threaten it. Let us be grateful that our Nation is at peace and rejoice in the progress we have made to bring about peace on Earth. And let us not forget the work still to be done, from Bosnia to the Middle East to the Korean Peninsula. Today our brave men and women in uniform are helping other people in other lands to make their peace. And across our country this holiday season people are joining in peace to feed the hungry, to bring toys to poor children who otherwise would not have them, and to reconcile our own differences. At Christmas and throughout the year the greatest gift of all we can give our own children is to make their world more safe, more peaceful, and more possible for them to make the most of their God-given potential. It is for our children that we must dedicate ourselves to making peace wherever we can, around the world, in every community, in our own homes, and perhaps most important, in our own hearts.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslightingthenationalchristmastree13", "title": "Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-lighting-the-national-christmas-tree-13", "publication_date": "05-12-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

So he served, but his commanding officers did not know it? Again, I do not know the specific documents you are referring to. If you want to bring those to me, I will be glad to take a look at them and get you the answers to your questions. Then on the general issue, Senator Kerry has said that the National Guard was one way for people to avoid service in Vietnam. The President and the White House have taken umbrage at that, saying that is denigrating the National Guard. In 1994, the President told the Houston Chronicle, in relation to his joining the National Guard, I was not prepared to shoot my eardrum out with a shotgun in order to get a deferment, nor was I willing to go to Canada, so I chose to better myself by learning how to fly airplanes. It sounds like the President, himself, acknowledged that he went into the National Guard because he did not want to go to Vietnam. Now we are trying to change into different issues here. The President was proud of his service in the National Guard. He fulfilled his duties; he was honorably discharged. I think there are some that we are now seeing are not interested in the facts. What they are interested in is trying to twist the facts for partisan political advantage in an election year. I am not doubting that, I am trying to explore it. One of the reasons the Democrats are raising it is because they have got a guy who was in Vietnam. Now it is -- he did not serve, now it is a different issue -- when the facts clearly show that he did serve, he did fulfill his duties, he did meet his requirements, he was honorably discharged. But he did not want to go to Vietnam. It is clear that some are not interested in the facts. It is clear that some may be more interested in using this for partisan political advantage. Are you saying that every date listed on document five is a day that the President was actually -- showed up, he was suited up, he was flying planes -- that is what that means?

{"id": 4985, "text": "That is what we Democrats believe in -- a vibrant free market, but one that works for everybody. That is our vision for a stronger economy and a growing middle class. And that is the difference between what we and Republicans in Congress are offering the American people right now. Let me give you a few specific examples of our different approaches. This week, I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. One of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in the United States. But for years, our tax code has actually given billions of dollars in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in Ohio, right here in the United States of America. And I am proposing that all American businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in 2011. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like Cleveland and Toledo and Dayton. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. For years, Republicans have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. Boehner was here in Cleveland he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like Ohio keep hundreds of thousands of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. Boehner dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps America strong. And, Ohio, I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in America -- not that create jobs overseas. That is one difference between the Republican vision and the Democratic vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example. We want to put more Americans back to work rebuilding America -- our roads, our railways, our runways.

We put two wars on a credit card. Our economy increasingly was built on financial speculation and a housing bubble. Manufacturing was leaving our shores. And although a few people were doing really, really well, that broad-based middle class that built this country, that was the essence of this country, found themselves--you found yourselves--in a situation where wages, incomes were flatlining and job growth was the most sluggish it had been in 50, 60 years and the cost of everything from health care to college education kept on going up and up and up. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Three million jobs lost in the 6 months before I took office, while we were campaigning, 800,000 jobs lost the month that I was sworn into office. And so we had to make a series of tough decisions and decisive decisions and quick decisions, and we had to do it without much help from the other side. But the thing that gave me confidence throughout was what I had learned about the American people as I traveled all across the country--and it is a great privilege just running for President and obviously a greater privilege being President because you meet Americans from every walk of life and they show you their grit and they show you their determination. And it turns out Americans are tougher than any tough times. And so when some people said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, we decided, no, we are going to make a bet on the American worker and American industry. And because of the actions that we took, GM is back on top, and we are seeing the auto industry rehiring and producing better cars than ever. We helped to stabilize the financial system so small businesses could get help again and get credit and financing flowing again. Businesses got back to basics, and we created 4.3 million jobs over the last 27 months, 800,000 this year alone. So we have made progress.

That we had a series of decisions that were going to help determine the future not just of our children, but our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. That we were living in an age in which the world had shrunk; it had become more interconnected than ever before.

But real people out there are in trouble. I mean, I was at a little delicatessen in Columbus, Ohio, the day before yesterday talking to the woman who ran it, and she insured her 20 full-time employees even though a lot of her competitors did not . She told me the stories about what had happened to their premiums when she got sick, how much she resented the fact that she did it and others did not . I mean, if you really go out there and talk to real people about how the system really works, it is very different than what these ads say. And the ads are designed to mislead people about our plan so that we can keep the same financing system we have got. That is why the health insurance industry's running them. But as a result of the way they do things, some people pay much more for insurance than others because they are older. Some people pay more just because they are in small businesses. Some people cannot get any insurance or can never change jobs because they have got a preexisting condition. No other country in the world does this. But one thing we do have more than anybody else in the world is clerical workers, in hospitals, in doctors' offices, insurance offices, keeping up with all these forms that are required so we can see who does not get what coverage and make sure you pay all that $20,000. When you and the First Lady lobbied the Business Council, and they voted two-to-one against the plan, were you surprised about that or-- No, they have never-you know, mostly they have not been for any of this. I was surprised that we have as much big business support as we do. What I wanted them to do, although it is largely ideological, most of them are paying premiums which are too high now.

There is a difference of opinion, obviously, in certain corners as to whether or not we should have gone into Iraq in the first place.

First of all, I want to thank the Japanese contribution in the Security Council. Secondly, I think there is an interesting new development, that the Japanese have decided to delay tabling the resolution to give the Chinese a chance to go to Pyongyang to have a discussion with the leader in North Korea, with the desire of having them come back to the table. So that is where we are-them being the North Koreans-come back to the table. But to answer your question, the strategy at this point in time is for the Chinese to travel and to make the claim that it would be in North Korea's interests that they come back to the table and remind them they have already been at the table and they agreed to a Korean Peninsula that is nuclear-weapons free.

What concerns everyone in the country is that after Watergate, we now have a crisis of confidence, in the CIA, for example, a feeling that it is out of hand, that it is not sufficiently accountable. How do you feel about the revelations of CIA? How do you relate them to the crisis of confidence? As a result of some of the revelations, I appointed the Rockefeller Commission. That Commission conducted a very thorough investigation of the allegations concerning the CIA. That Commission has recommended to me certain administrative actions that I should take and some legislative proposals that I should submit to the Congress. My staff has taken the Rockefeller Commission recommendations and the Murphy Commission recommendations-and that Commission got into the CIA to some extent and I intend to submit to the Congress specific proposals that I think will maintain the CIA and our total intelligence-gathering community so they can do the job which is essential for our national security on the one hand and at the same time preclude our intelligence-gathering agencies from violating our constitutional rights as individuals. That is a point that I would like to raise with you.   Now, those fellows in the CIA do not just report on wars and the like. They go out and make their own and there is nobody to keep track of what they are up to. They spend billions of dollars on stirring up trouble so they will have something to report on. They do not have to account to anybody. That is a very dangerous thing in a democratic society.

No one is entitled to more credit for this new day than Your Excellency, for you labored unceasingly and generously both as host and as statesman for the success of that conference. I believe that when history comes to be written, the origin of the new American era will be placed here in the memorable year 1933. Truly, it is an inspiration for the average citizen of all our Republics that that conference is giving back its fruits in terms of achievement for the people of the world. During the past week I have become certain of this because I have seen in the faces of the men, women, and children in Rio de Janeiro, in Buenos Aires, and, today, in Montevideo a joyful expression of hope and faith which can and will inspire us, their chosen representatives, to even greater activity in the common cause. You, Mr. President, have used a term in speaking of that great patriot, General Artigas, which can well be the inspiration of us all. You have spoken of his serene and noble spirit of applied justice. It is because of this spirit which actuated the founding fathers of the American Republics that we their followers are inspired to maintain the democratic principles for which they fought. I am particularly grateful for the kind words which you, Mr. President, have spoken concerning our policies in the United States of America. We fully join with you in the thought that the first battlefield of peace is that of securing well-being at home. It has been of special interest to me to know that you in the Republic of Uruguay have made such great advances in behalf of the well-being of your citizens. In the days of General Artigas and of his friend President Monroe, human society had, of course, little conception of the economic and social problems which we face today. None of the fathers of any of our Republics had even heard of an eight-hour day, of minimum wages, of protection for women and children, of collective bargaining between employers and employees, of old-age security, of modern sanitation, of concrete highways, of railroads or steel buildings.

And he said that, The President and his team at the White House believe that the Attorney General has the intellect, experience, and integrity to efficiently run the Department of Justice and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the American people. And I think I could not say it any better, so I quoted the Chief of Staff saying it. Just to button down the Issa thing, finally -- they point specifically to two instances in the briefing where you said on May 21st, referred to apparent conduct by our IRS officials in Cincinnati; and on May 20th, line IRS employees in Cincinnati improperly scrutinized 501- organizations. Those are the findings of the audit conducted by the independent Inspector General, correct? I was citing -- and perhaps there are issues that the Chairman has with the IG. I was citing the findings of the independent Inspector General. The President responded I think with appropriate concern and took immediate action, and is continuing to direct those who are responsible for these matters to take action. Again, the Inspector General concluded in his report and testified to this before Congress that he found no evidence of outside influence on the behavior that was of such great concern to all of us at the IRS. It is also important to note the President has instructed the new acting commissioner of the IRS to conduct a review that looks at this activity; holds responsible those who were responsible for it -- holds accountable those who are responsible for it; and takes measures to ensure that it cannot happen again. Separately, we are cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight. Separately, the Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation.

If it is, it is because of the new budget and we are trying to economize on our light bill. It may surprise you, but the lights on this establishment are $4600 a month alone, so you can imagine how many checks will have to have deductions to even pay the light bill. I am reminded of the story that the Postmaster General told me about getting a letter from a little boy who had lost his father and whose widowed mother was having difficulty making ends meet. Please send mom $100 to help with the family. The letter wound up on the Postmaster General's desk and he was quite touched by it. He at that time still had a little money left over from what he had earned at Prudential, so he took a $20 bill out of his pocket, put it in a Postmaster General's envelope, put an air mail stamp on it, and sent it to the little boy. Much obliged for all you have done. We appreciate it. But we need another $100. If you do not mind, when you send it to momma this time, do not route it through Washington, because they deducted 80 percent of it there. I have a little statement prepared here expressing my gratitude, but I think I want to say something else before I get into that. You businessmen have a very unique role in our Government, and a very special responsibility. You are the symbols of the free enterprise system. You are what makes the difference in the type of government we have and the type that our challenger has. Someone asked me the other day if I did not think I was making a rather dangerous venture when, contrary to the practice of the last few years, I sent a budget to Congress that did not add $5 billion on to take care of increased population and increased needs, and by withholding that amount out of the economic bloodstream if I did not think we would lack the financial stimulus necessary to give us the prosperity we wanted.

And we have got a new trade deal with Japan where the Japanese for the first time agreed to dramatically reduce the trade deficit. By the way, did you expect that going there? No, but I hoped for it. I had an instinct that both those things could happen. Everybody said nothing is going to happen at this meeting because all of these countries are in terrible economic shape, all their leaders are unpopular. We have got a global economic crisis, and when people cannot make a living, when they are insecure, they are worried about losing their health care, their benefits, the ability to raise and educate their children, leaders are not going to be popular. But what happened was, there was a sense that we owed it to the people we represent to do something, to try to move this economy and create jobs and get some things going. And that spirit sort of overtook the meeting. I called several of them before we met, and I said, Everybody says we are not going to do anything, but why is that? Why do not we go and do something? And I was very pleased with it. Los Angeles, as we go back to calls for President Clinton. Well, the deficit has dropped this year about $25 billion or so below where it was estimated to be when I took office because interest rates have dropped. Therefore, what we have to pay on the accumulated debt of the country has gone down. The only reason interest rates have dropped is because we have got a serious attempt to reduce the deficit. Seventy percent of the new taxes will be paid by people who make incomes above $200,000. No income tax increases will be paid by people who have adjusted gross incomes-individuals below $140,000, couples below $180,000. And this modest fuel tax will amount to about $50 a year for families with incomes of about $50,000.

In the meantime, we better transition to this period. In other words, evidently our Congress must have thought that there will be instant technology on the market because they prevented us, since 2001, from exploring for known oil and gas reserves that we can do in environmentally friendly ways.

And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And Malaysia is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way.

As you know, ENTITY, there is a traditional language for these kinds of conflicts, and its victory, or its loss you win a war or you lose a war. Is there a victory definition for Afghanistan now or is that part of your thinking at this moment? I think there are achievable goals in Afghanistan, and the achievable goal is to make sure it is not a safe haven for terrorists, to make sure that the Afghan people are able to determine their own fate. One of the things that I think we have to communicate in Afghanistan is that we have no interest or aspiration to be there over the long term. There is a long history, as you know, in Afghanistan of rebuffing what is seen as an occupying force, and we have to be mindful of that history as we think about our strategy. Our goal in the region is to keep the American people safe. And I think that the more we can accomplish that through diplomacy, and the more we can accomplish that by partnering with actors in the region, rather than simply applying U.S. military forces, the better off we are going to be.

{"id": 2790, "text": "that you and Congress agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economist's measure a drag on the economy. There is not a day goes by I do not get some analyst saying that -- and that the Fed is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do between now and the end of the year to overcome the Republicans' opposition and change that, to end sequester? First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if we are growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit. Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in 2011 is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of Republicans and Democrats to spend a year and a half trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that Republicans embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of this year, despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. Point number two, every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and we are thinking about jobs and we are thinking about the middle class, but we are also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure do not go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, we are starting to see health care costs slow.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjackiecalmesandmichaeldshearthenewyorktimes", "title": "Barack Obama Interview with Jackie Calmes and Michael D.

Two years ago we identified the two genes that are the biggest predictors of breast cancer for women.

Can you imagine what the Congress would say if I said, Hey, I have got a deal for you, and it just costs $1.9 trillion. Let us go do this ? The second battle was the battle to define the Union in terms of who was part of it. That is what Abraham Lincoln, you know, lived and died for. Gary Wills has argued brilliantly that he, in effect, rewrote the Constitution, the common meaning of the Constitution, for the Gettysburg Address, and brought it closer to the natural meaning of the words the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Then the third time we had to redefine the Union was under Woodrow Wilson Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, whom we had one, we moved into an industrial era, and we had this huge wave of immigrants coming into our cities, into our factories. And we had to define, number one, what the role of the Nation was in incorporating all these people and defining the conditions of civilized life child labor, minimum work week, all that stuff. And number two, what the role of the Government was in mediating between the industrial society and the civil society, which was the antitrust laws, in an economic sense, and in a larger sense, all that land Teddy Roosevelt set aside, when people first began to worry about pollution and using natural resources and all that. Teddy Roosevelt partly was able to be our first great conservation President, because people could see that growth in pollution could take away some of our natural resources.

We should move about getting that taken care of, making sure there is a pathway to earn citizenship and get underway.

And the best example is the debate we are having right now around the payroll tax cut extension. This is a deal that we cut last year that every economist says we need to help sustain the recovery. And traditionally, Republicans have tried to claim the mantle of being in favor of every tax cut. They never want to raise taxes. And yet, we have the prospect in 20-some days that 160 million Americans will see their taxes go up by an average of a thousand bucks. And yet, it is become a negotiation, where they think that in order for us to do something that is common sense and needed for our economy, that somehow they are doing me a favor. This is not something you do for me. We even had a Republican quoted in the newspapers yesterday, saying that If we load up a whole bunch of additional stuff that ENTITY does not like, then maybe we'd pass the payroll tax -- and the more ENTITY does not like it, the more I like it. That attitude just drives people crazy. Have you given up on the Republicans? Have you stopped reaching out to them? Are you just out there now trying to get your message across? Every opportunity that I see for us to be able to actually get something done, I will seize. So we passed three trade agreements that the Republicans agreed to. And I lined up my party behind it, even though it was not popular in certain segments of my party.

I have just come back from a very fine visit to New Jersey to see a new steelplant that is exciting for an engineer and a President to observe. This is the most modern steelplant in the world. Each employee produces 1,340 tons of steel per year, including all the executive management. This is the highest productivity per steelworker in the world. They use 30 percent as much energy as the former steelplants used. They make steelrod of the highest quality, and 50 percent of it, you might be interested in knowing, is sold at this time to the People's Republic of China, successfully competing in price half the world away with the Japanese steelplants that are much closer. The dynamism and competence of our own Nation and its free enterprise system, in my judgment, is equaled by the dynamism and confidence and the competence of the public servants like you, who represent the American people in our Federal Government. I came to the Presidency determined to make my own administration and the Government in general more responsive to the American public and at the same time more efficient in the delivery of services to those who look to us for leadership and for service. Since taking office, I have seen repeatedly that the key to the more effective Government, which we all desire, has been our creation of a more productive, more dynamic, and more cost-conscious Federal workforce. In 1978, with the help of many of you assembled here, I was able to sign into law a bill which completely overhauled the civil service system of the Federal Government for the first time in a hundred years. It was Scotty Campbell's concept, which the Congress courageously passed for my signature. It was one of the most significant achievements of my own administration. The Civil Service Reform Act gives Federal managers, like many of you, some of the same management incentives that have proved so effectively to make our private economy and its free enterprise system competitive and the pride of the entire world. It emphasizes performance, not just longevity. It lets us select individual public servants and reward them, and thereby in a positive way encourage others to excel.

Some of you are law enforcement officers. Some are civilians who work for victims' rights. Some are fighting obscenity and the unspeakable evil of child pornography. Others are working to prevent drug abuse. In the past 4 or 5 months, I have heard a lot of talk-much of it, to put it most kindly, inaccurate-about our social agenda, particularly as it applies to the courts.

I do not need to tell anyone here the sad, often tragic story of years of judicial solicitation for every conceivable right of criminals and neglect for the victims of crime, of playing fast and loose with first amendment rights in a way that gave too many pornographers free rein, of fanciful constitutional arguments used to throw out long and hard police work, and of the price our nation has paid for all of this. One way, for example, that we have paid that price has been in the wider and wider availability of pornography. The sale of pornography was once said to be victimless. But common sense should have told us all along that pornography has many victims-among them, children. I read a statistic recently that, in a single day, one dial-a-porn company has received 800,000 calls. I am told that the great proportion of those calls are thought to have been made by children. Let me mention here-and I have recently sent Congress a bill that will make it easier for law enforcement officials to fight obscenity and child pornography. But incredible as it may seem, there are well-meaning people who will oppose it. The most extreme say that the first amendment protects child pornographers as they publish and distribute their products.

So I am basically quite optimistic about the American economy as long as we keep the fundamentals right. You mentioned Robert Rubin, and there are some people who believe that since Robert Rubin left his post as Treasury Secretary, that the administration has modified its policy on the dollar. Can you clarify this for us? And we have seen the dollar under pressure recently. Do you no longer support a strong dollar policy? No, we have not modified our policy. I think that what you have seen with the dollar is partly a function of an expected recovery in Asia, and I think that on balance, that is good. And the European economy may be growing a little more; on balance, that is good. Plus, you know, to try to help our friends in Asia and Russia get through this crisis-and the Chinese particularly have had-even they have had a little bit of problems-we have run quite a large trade deficit here because we have not wanted to close our markets since they were in trouble. Those things happen-that tends to weaken the currency too, after a certain amount of time. So I have not been particularly alarmed by it, but neither am I for a weak dollar. I think the United States has to be for a strong dollar. And again, I say the way for us to do that is to not abandon our budgetary discipline and our long-term policies on expanded trade and investments and technology.

We are going to immunize 2 million children under the age of 2 by 1996. We passed a bill called Goals 2000 to have national world-class standards education for our classes, but have more local control of the schools at the same time. We passed a bill to improve apprenticeships in every State, so that more kids could leave high school and go to work and get good jobs if they did not go to college. Perhaps the most important thing we did was we reformed the student loan program and made 20 million people eligible for lower interest student loans at longer repayment. And we, of course, passed national service, which allows young people to earn college credit by doing community service or earn money to go to college. We passed this crime bill after 6 years of haggling. And it is very tough in terms of three strikes and you are out and 100,000 more jail cells and 100,000 more police on the street. But it also has some good prevention programs that give our kids something to say yes to, drug treatment, drug education, job training, wholesome and constructive community-based recreation programs.

So a lot of the big things we do does not get a lot of press. But anyway, we reduce the size of the Federal Government by 272,000 over this budget cycle. Now, we have already reduced it, already, just in 20 months, by more than 70,000. But in the 5-year period, 270,000 will be taken off.

And the person who invited me came to the Grand Central and walked from the Grand Central to the Waldorf Astoria, and in that short walk, four people offered him drugs. Is it in the United States that there is not enough control and enough punishment, enough action in that way? So, what can you tell our readers about that? Cano first, I strongly supported what President Barco said when he called attention of the world and certainly the United States to the consumption problem. We have no argument with that he is right. And what I am trying to do in our new antidrug strategy is to go after not only the criminals that sell drugs to your friend in those two blocks but the people that use it. We are coupling with that an all-out education program that is not just government but private sector as well. What concerns me and other leaders is that it is going not only into some countries in our own hemisphere, South America, but all through Europe. And I asked the Soviets if they had a problem with it, and it is everywhere. But I think when President Barco, my respected friend, pointed out, look, you have got to do something about consumption, he was right. And I have used that in speaking to leadership groups in this room and in others to try to encourage support for our antinarcotics program, which still does have strong support in our country, and for the legislation we need, getting tougher on the people that sell it, and for the education, of educating against being a user.

This is all by statute. The simple fact is that today a new need for legislative action arises because the personnel of the Federal Judiciary is insufficient to meet the business before them. A growing body of our citizens complain of the complexities, the delays, and the expense of litigation in United States Courts. I then mention the letter from the Attorney General. Delay in any court results in injustice. It makes lawsuits a luxury available only to the few who can afford them or who have property interests to protect which are sufficiently large to repay the cost. Poorer litigants are compelled to abandon valuable rights or to accept inadequate or unjust settlements because of sheer inability to finance or to await the end of a long litigation. Only by speeding up the processes of the law and thereby reducing their cost, can we eradicate the growing impression that the courts are chiefly a haven for the well-to-do. Now we come to the next, the courts of appeal. Delays in the determination of appeals have the same effect. Moreover, if trials of original actions are expedited and existing accumulations of cases are reduced, the volume of work imposed on the Circuit Courts of Appeals will further increase. The attainment of speedier justice in the courts below will enlarge the task of the Supreme Court itself. And still more work would be added by the recommendation which I make later in this message for the quicker determination of constitutional questions by the highest court. Even at the present time the Supreme Court is laboring under a heavy burden. Its difficulties in this respect were superficially lightened some years ago by authorizing the court, in its discretion, to refuse to hear appeals in many classes of cases. This discretion was so freely exercised that in the last fiscal year, although 867 petitions for review were presented to the Supreme Court, it declined to hear 717 cases. As you know, any litigant seeking to appeal to the Supreme Court takes it there on certiorari. That is a certiorari process and out of 867 cases the Supreme Court last year turned down 727.

In terms of high-speed rail, I think there is enormous opportunities here. Now, I would have loved to have seen more done on high-speed rail in the recovery package, because I think it is the right direction for us to go in. I could not credibly claim that all of the investments that are necessary are short term enough to be in a recovery package, as opposed to be part of our broader transportation bills and budget. I mean, we have laid a transcontinental railway system during the Civil War. Railroads were always the pride of America and stitched us together. Now Japan, China, all of Europe have high-speed rail systems that put ours to shame. And the potential economic benefits of a high-speed rail link between Chicago and Milwaukee, so that people are avoiding I-94, or the length between Chicago and St. Louis, Detroit, all those Midwestern cities, I think is enormous, and is a very real option with although gas prices are low right now, it becomes a very meaningful option for people who do not want to take off their shoes, drive to an airport, pay for parking, suffer delays. I should point out that the opportunities around the rail are not just in high-speed rail. I mean, there is some basic freight rail issues in Chicago, Milwaukee, the Midwest that can also be solved and would help with the whole distribution of goods in the region that would save business a lot of money. And I hope that we end up spending some time focused on that during the transportation reauthorization.

I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of Indonesia rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in Bali for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws.

Well, right now I think the what I would like to do is two things. First of all, I want to get a reaffirmation of the partnership we have with China in the four-party talks. I want to send a clear signal to North Korea and to South Korea that we are prepared to do our part, but I also want us to clearly support the bilateral efforts that are now going on. Kim Dae-jung was inaugurated in South Korea, I have been quite encouraged at the attitude he has taken toward, you know, reaching out directly to the North. It appears to me, based on the work we did to end the work that we did with China together to end North Korea's dangerous nuclear program, which had a lot of involvement from Japan and Russia and other countries all supported us. It appears to me that there are some of these matters that divide the North from the South that will have to be resolved directly between the two Koreas. And then there are other things that they will actually need the framework of the four-party talks to work through and the active involvement of China and the United States. We will be talking about that. But again, this whole matter has acquired greater urgency because of the nuclear tests on the Indian subcontinent. You know, we have to keep the commitment of North Korea in place not to have a nuclear program, particularly since they have such facility in building missiles.

We actually could move rather quickly on this, or they could drag it out the way they have been.

Thus far, we have frozen $6 million in bank accounts linked to terrorist activity. We have frozen 30 Al Qaida accounts in the United States and 20 overseas.

I want to talk about the terrorist attack in Uganda. Clearly your administration is taking this al-Shabab very seriously. You have had a senior official tell us the organization -- the operational abilities of that entity out there is maybe stronger than any other -- -- al Qaeda. Should we be doing more militarily in Yemen than we are now? Well, here is what we have done. Part of the reason that an analyst would say that al Qaeda is stronger in Yemen than just about anywhere else is because we have actually been pretty successful at forcing al Qaeda in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan to hunker down. They have been pinned down, and it is hard for them to carry out big operations. We have got to keep that pressure up. It is absolutely true, though, that al Qaeda in Yemen is dangerous. And what they have been able to do is not mount huge-scale attacks, but they are successfully recruiting individuals who may carry out low-level attacks -- Well, it is scarier, oddly enough, for some people. Well, in some ways it is harder because these are people whose name are not on a list. Abdulmutallab, the guy who tried to blow up the plane over Detroit, is a classic example of the kind of person that al Qaeda in Yemen is recruiting. Many people are traveling to Yemen, getting indoctrinated, and then being sent back to the West. So we have been cooperating with the Yemeni government. We want to make sure that we are entirely on top of it. Are they cooperating with us? Its terrain is a little bit like Afghanistan's. They have got their own ethnic problems there. And so this is a tough part of the world. But we are building up capacity, working with them to make sure that we do not take our eye off the ball, even as we continue to put pressure between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The first is when I say at the end of a long day, towards the end of a long campaign, that part of the reason that you had a lot of working-class whites supporting a Republican agenda that on its face does not seem to be serving their interest is because they have given up hope that the system is going to look out for them. So their attitude is that, If you are not going to help me get a job, if you are not going do anything concrete for me, then at least I am going to cling onto my religion and my Second Amendment rights . And I said that not from an unsympathetic perspective. that these communities feel ignored, and so it is much easier for them to think in terms of those constants in their identity. But just by saying, They cling to their guns and Bibles made it, as David Axelrod said right after I said it, anthropological, made it sound patronizing, and to this day is the primary proof point that is used to argue that I am not sympathetic towards those communities, that I am sort of this elitist, coastal liberal, and in part responsible for the backlash to my presidency. And if I had been a white person saying the exact same thing, it would not have played the same way. If I had said it the way I meant it or felt it, it would have been absorbed differently. But because there was a racial component to it, immediately it becomes a permanent talking point. And then you have got Skip Gates being arrested, which, to me, I was saying something pretty obvious. They ended up handcuffing this middle-aged, elderly man on his own porch.

Naturally, I admire your work, but I add very quickly that I need your help. A meaningful discussion of national problems cannot take place only on network television or in large metropolitan newspapers, because these forums do not provide sufficient opportunity for audience response and direct participation. One of the reasons, in my judgment, it is important for me and members of this Administration to travel around our country and to meet in Washington with groups like this one is to listen as well as to talk about the Nation's problems. Perhaps my Congressional background convinced me of the value of face-to-face contact, but there is no substitute for the discussions of ideas in person with community leaders such as yourselves. The best briefing paper in the world cannot explain problems as well as someone who deals with those problems on a very daily and direct basis. Government officials, I have learned, whether it was in the Congress or in this house, need more talkback from the people that they serve, and that is particularly true of those of us in Washington in the political atmosphere in which we live. This town can be just as parochial as a town of 250 people, and in some respects it is even more so. One of our ways at the White House of getting talkback is the briefing sessions that you have participated in, but another is for you to send your comments, your editorials to Ron Nessen of our Press Office. We need to hear from you, and we need to hear from the readers that all of you serve. We also need your help in describing the problems and the solutions that seem to be the best answer to the problems that we have. But the economic and energy debate underway now must not become simply an exchange of rhetoric, whether it is in the printed media, the electronic media, or just plain talk among people. The debate, as I see it, must produce action.

These recommendations, based on the latest and best medical evidence, give clear, consistent guidance to women in our national fight against breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. It affects one in eight women in their lifetimes and has touched the families of nearly every American, including my own. We may not yet have a cure for breast cancer, but we do know that early detection and early treatment are our most potent weapons against this dread disease and we know that mammography can save lives. That is why it is important to send a clear, consistent message to women and to their families about when to start getting mammograms and how often to repeat them. After careful study of the science, the National Cancer Advisory Board has now concluded that women between the ages of 40 and 49 should get a mammography examination for breast cancer every 1 or 2 years, in consultation with their doctors. The National Cancer Institute has now accepted these recommendations. Now women in their forties will have clear guidance based on the best science, and action to match it. Today I am taking action to bring Medicare, Medicaid, and the Federal employee health plans in line with the National Cancer Institute's recommendations. First, in the Medicare budget I am sending to Congress today I am making annual screening mammography exams, beginning at age 40, a covered expense without coinsurance or deductibles. Second, Secretary Shalala is sending a letter to State Medicaid directors urging them to also cover annual mammograms beginning at 40 and assuring them that the Federal Government will pay its matching share if they do so. And today I am directing the Office of Personnel Management to require all Federal health benefit plans to comply with the National Cancer Advisory Board's recommendations on mammogram screenings, beginning next year. The Federal Government is doing its part to make sure women have both coverage and access to this potentially lifesaving test. I want to challenge private health insurance plans to do the same. They, too, should cover regular screening mammograms for women 40 and over. Finally, we know there has been much discussion on this issue and a lot of confusion. That is why we are launching a major public education campaign to make sure every woman and every health care professional in America, that all of them are aware of these new recommendations.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalcancerinstituterecommendationsmammographyandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on National Cancer Institute Recommendations on Mammography and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-national-cancer-institute-recommendations-mammography-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "27-03-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Are you really inviting the major emitters, including China, to Washington, DC, at the end of this month? What kind of initiatives or roadmaps do you have in mind for the post-Kyoto framework? Yes, look, I think we need to make sure that we get the major emitters, the big economies of the world that are emitting greenhouse gases to the table so that we can all be at the same table. And the first step toward coming up with a common accord is to recognize there is a problem and set a goal, a reduction goal, because I believe once you get people to sign up to a goal, it makes it easier to begin to get ask them to sign up to a solution. The purpose is to set up a process that includes everybody. Now, the United States, by the way, has reduced greenhouse gas emissions last year. We grew our economy at about 3 percent, and our greenhouse gases went down. But the truth of the matter is, if we really want to be serious about solving this problem, the question is, how fast can we get new technologies to the marketplace? And the countries that are going to be leading the way and developing new technologies will be the United States and Japan. For example, I believe that the Japanese battery makers will be coming to the market, hopefully, relatively soon, with a new battery that will enable us to drive a reg-ular-size automobile for 40 miles on electricity. one, less dependence on oil, which will help both our countries; and two, it will help us clean up the environment. And so technologies is going to really make an enormous difference. And to the extent that the United States and Japan cooperates on technologies, it will help the world. We are wealthy nations, and these developing nations are going to look to us to help them develop technologies that will enable them to grow their economies and, at the same time, be better stewards of the environment. So the way I see it is, post-Kyoto is going to be setting goals, helping countries with the technological developments they need so that each country could meet the goal it sets.

I know that I am not satisfying you, and I know this is going to be the major matter before the Congress, this matter of affording a tax cut at a time when we have a deficit. But I do point out that the largest peacetime deficit, which was the '58 deficit of $12.5 billion, came at a time when President Eisenhower believed that he had presented a balanced budget, and the reason of course was the recession of '58. The biggest deficit comes historically and it has been proved, in 1958, 1960 because of a recession. That is what would really knock our budget out of shape. So that as I tried to say in my speech, we are not faced with the question of balancing our budget, or having a tax reduction. I believe we are faced with the fact that we are going to have a deficit mostly because of the sharp rise in the recent years in space and defense, and to increase our taxes sufficient to bring that budget into balance would be defeating, because of course it would provide a heavy deflationary effect on our economy, and move us into a recession at an accelerated rate. So I hope that you gentlemen will realize that we are not talking about irresponsibly increasing the deficit. We have a deficit which is already on the books. What I am concerned about is the kind of deficit we would have if we had a recession, and while the prospects for a recession are not certainly imminent before us, we do have to look at our historical record and realize that any society such as ours, particularly with the tax structure such as ours, must face that prospect at some time. So that we have to decide which kind of a deficit do we want, and for what reason, and which in the longer run offers us the better prospect of bringing our books into balance. In addition, we are hopeful, as the Minuteman begins to come into our defenses, that we will be able to bring our defense expenditures to a level, unless we have a severe international emergency, which in a period of the not-to-distant future will cap off our defense expenditures.

But I would expect that Governor Brown and I and other State and Federal officials would eagerly search for a basis on which we could assure California adequate energy supplies in the future.

And I do hope that you will give it serious thought to keep venture capital going, not for the big corporations. We support the big corporation.

And I believe that when the tax reform package is made public, that there will be a sigh of relief and also a removal of the inevitable uncertainty about what the terms of the tax proposal might encompass.

It goes into Syria. So, to have a government that understands its responsibilities - that it is not just about who the Shia in charge, the Shia rule and we do not pay any attention to the needs of Sunnis or the Kurds - that provides fertile territory for some, especially the Sunni, to be responsive to ISIS when they were originally coming through.

You write them back, too? The most interesting letters I get, because they are unexpected, and I am talking about since the election, have been people who've written and said, I did not vote for you, but I want you to know that I appreciate the manner in which you have conducted yourself in office. In some cases they said, In retrospect I think you did a pretty good job. Those letters, in some ways, mean the most to me because you are persuading skeptics. But even if you have not persuaded them on the issues, at least maybe they have recognized that I have tried to be true to the meaning of this office, that I have held it in reverence.

For schools that cannot reopen safely, help them improve the virtual learning. President Trump should stop tweeting and start doing his work. What is key to people feeling safe to go back to work and school is a vaccine. A recent CBS News, UGOV poll found that some 70% of Americans would either wait to get a vaccine and see what happens to other people or not get one at all. That is a huge segment of the population. How then would you secure that every American gets a vaccine as soon as possible considering that distrust? Make it totally open for review by every medical facility in the country, making clear that in fact it is safe, instead of what Trump is talking about. He is talking about all these different vaccines. Much earlier I laid out what would we constitute a business being able to reopen. When I talked about it, I said we should have a circumstance where they were able to meet all the criteria that are recommended by the CDC and others and be able to put on a sticker on their window saying, like a good housekeeping seal, You can come in here because we test, we distance, we do all alike. The fact is that the way he talks about the vaccine is not particularly rational. He is talking it being ready. He is going to talk about moving it quicker than the scientists think it should be moved. Let the medical community writ large speak to it so that there is transparency. Look, I think people are going to, as the poll show and we talked about it today with the two docs and my staff, that in fact people do not believe that he is telling the truth. Therefore, they are not at all certain they are going to take the vaccine. One more thing, if and when the vaccine comes, and it is not likely to go through all the tests that needs and the trials that are needed to be done, and the question is, is he going to seek emergency move? I proposed a $25 billion plan for the distribution to guarantee that every single American has access to the vaccine because what is going to happen, you know as well as I do, if the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people?

I think every civilized nation in the world recognizes that this was an assault not just against the United States but against civilization.

Well, again, this would be something that we will face when we see the '83 budget, although I do not believe that the so-called safety net has been much changed. This recession-remember that when we came here, January 20th, we had a great unemployment problem, severe in several areas far more than in others. It is easy to look at, say, an 8 percent inflation rate and think of that as the nation as a whole. We have States, and some of you are probably from those States, where inflation is approaching the 20 percent mark. That is like the Great Depression of the thirties, due to the particular industries that have been affected-in addition to construction, the steel industry, automobiles, and so forth. We think that the best thing that we can do is to go forward with this plan, which we think is going to stimulate the economy. I think we are due, for several months yet, of hard times, but I think that in '82 we are going to see-later in the year-a change in the situation. The falling interest rates indicate that-the inflation rates that I mentioned-so that I think the safety net is still there for those people of real need.

The FBI recommended to the Attorney General, and she recommended to the Post and Times, after careful consideration, that they publish this for two reasons. One is they really felt, based on the best psychological profile they had of the Unabomber, that he would honor his commitment and stop killing people, stop trying to kill people. And secondly, they felt that the publication of the document, if it could be widely read, might actually help Federal authorities who have been looking for this person for nearly 20 years now, to identify a range of potential suspects. And they thought that this was not like, you know, like asking for a million dollars or asking to swap hostages or anything like that. So it was for that reason, with great reluctance, that the FBI recommended, that the Attorney General recommended, and that the Times and the Post did it. And you agree with it? I do agree with it under these circumstances. I sympathize with the comments of the gentleman that just called in. Our basic policy is strictly to not cooperate with terrorists of any kind.

In other words, we have got a new man who has assumed power, and he must hear a focused message. I was pleased with Gerhard Schroeder's statement here, and Prime Minister Blair can speak for himself. In order to achieve a diplomatic objective, it is very important to have clear goals.

And the world is speaking in one voice, and so the message now to the new leader is a very strong message. With regard to trade, African leaders have been pretty loud in pointing out that subsidies and tariffs are a tremendous handicap to the development of trade. Europe, in particular, has been hostile to really lifting tariffs and subsidies. Well, I appreciate you bringing that up. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, signed by my predecessor and extended by the Congress in my administration, is working. I want to remind people that ultimately it is commerce, trade, economic growth that will overwhelm the need for aid itself. And exports from sub-Sahara Africa to the United States are up 88 percent because we have opened up our markets. The best approach to dealing with Europe-and our own subsidies for that mat-ter-on agricultural matters, is to go to the Doha round of the WTO and jointly declare that we are going to get rid of all agricultural subsidies. The other thing is, it is very important for African nations themselves to eliminate the barriers of trade intracontinent, between themselves. There are, if you look- at least there was the last time I looked- there were some impediments to trade amongst the African nations. And so the- we have all got responsibilities to make trade freer.

I remarked that the people of the North were anxious that the process of reconstruction should be thorough, and they wished to support him in the arduous work; but their ideas were confused by the conflicting reports constantly circulated, and especially by the present position of the democratic party. It is industriously circulated in the democratic clubs that he was going over to them. Major, have you never known a man who for many years had differed from your views because you were in advance of him, claim them as his own when he came up to your standpoint?

You and I need no preparation for this conversation; we can talk freely on this subject, for the thoughts are familiar to us; we can be perfectly frank with each other.

Individuals tried to carry them out but did not succeed, as a man may try to cut his throat and be prevented by the bystanders, and you cannot say he cut his throat because he tried to do it. Individuals may commit treason and be punished, and a large number of individuals may constitute a rebellion and be punished as traitors. Some States tried to get out of the Union and we opposed it, honestly, because we believed it to be wrong; and we have succeeded in putting down the rebellion. The power of those persons who made the attempt has been crushed, and now we want to reconstruct the State governments, and have the power to do it.

We will not put in the Pershings and cruise missiles if they will do away with the SS-20's. I do not think they would have ever come to negotiate had it not been for the imminence of that proposal-the fact that we are all going forward. I would hope that before all those missiles are in place on our side, we would have negotiated an agreement in which they will be unnecessary and the Soviets will remove theirs. Are you sanguine about the prospects of these negotiations? Can they be achieved apart and before, perhaps, a larger START agreement? We have completed our arrangements and proposals here to go forward with the START which has to do with the intercontinental missiles. Again, I believe that we are getting the evidence of willingness from the Soviet Union to at least negotiate, to talk, because we are going forward with the rebuilding of our own military and because our allies have shown their own determination on the intermediate weapons. In recent years when we were letting our defenses crumble and were virtually unilaterally disarming, there was no incentive for the Soviet Union to meet us in any kind of arms reduction talks because they were engaged in the most massive buildup the world has ever seen at the same time we were apparently not willing to even try and keep pace.

Now, that is the purpose of prosperity. Since 1992, America has grown not just economically but as a community. We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed that bridge together. America's success was not a matter of chance; it was a matter of choice. And today, America faces another choice. It is every bit as momentous as the one we faced 8 years ago. For what a nation does with its good fortune is just as stern a test of its character, values, and judgment as how it deals with adversity. My fellow Americans, this is a big election with great consequences for every American, because the differences, the honest differences, between our candidates and their visions are so profound. We can a have good, old-fashioned election here. We should posit that our opponents are good, honorable, patriotic people, and that we have honest differences. We in America would already have, this year, a real Patients' Bill of Rights, a minimum wage increase, stronger equal pay laws for women, and middle class tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care if the Democratic Party were in the majority in Congress with Dick Gephardt as Speaker and Tom Daschle as majority leader. That has to be clear to people. But if you will give me one moment of personal privilege, I'd like to say a word about Hillary. When I first met her 30 years ago, she already had an abiding passion to help children. And she is pursued it ever since. Her very first job out of law school was with the Children's Defense Fund. Every year I was Governor she took lots of time away from her law practice to work for better schools or better children's health or jobs for parents who lived in poor areas. Then when I became President, she became a full-time advocate for her lifetime cause, and what a job she has done. She championed the family leave law, children's health insurance, increased support for foster children and adoptions. She wrote a best-selling book about caring for our children, and then she took care of them by giving all the profits to children's charities. For 30 years 30 years from the first day I met her, she has always been there for all our kids. She is always been there for our family.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthedemocraticnationalconventionlosangelescalifornia", "title": "Remarks to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-democratic-national-convention-los-angeles-california", "publication_date": "14-08-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2811, "text": "You have made speeches, you have addressed the joint session of Congress, you have done interviews, but the polling continues to show that people are still skeptical about your health reform plans. Orrin Hatch, the Republican senator from Utah -- who is done a lot of work on health care over the years, summed it up this way, these are his words, he said, If anyone believes that Washington can do a plan that will cost close to a trillion dollars, cover all Americans, not raise taxes on anyone, not increase the deficit, not reduce benefits or choices for our families and seniors, then I have a bridge to sell you. Have you promised too much, ENTITY? No, I do not think I have promised too much at all. Look, first of all, everybody acknowledges this is a problem -- everybody -- acknowledges that the current path we are on is unsustainable, not just for the people who do not have health insurance but for those who do. We just had a study come out this week showing that premiums for families went up 130 percent over the last decade. Those costs probably went up even higher for the average employer. And that is part of the reason why you are seeing, each successive year, fewer Americans having health insurance from their employers than they previously did. Health care inflation went up 5.5 percent this past year when inflation was actually negative, because of this extraordinary recession. Now, what I have said is that we can make sure that people who do not have health insurance can buy into an insurance pool that gives them better bargaining power. For people who have health insurance, we can provide health insurance reforms that make the insurance they have more secure. And we can do that mostly by using money that every expert agrees is being wasted and is currently in the existing health care system. So, in fact, what we have got right now is about 80 percent consensus on how we would accomplish that. Now, let me be honest, with a piece of legislation this complicated, and a sector the economy that is about one-sixth of our economy, there is a reason why, for the last 40 years, people have been talking about this and it has not gotten done. It is hard ---- and there are a lot of moving parts.

{"id": 4512, "text": "I have reviewed the present fiscal situation with Secretary Mellon and Under Secretary Mills this morning, and I can state that there is no ground now for the anticipation that we shall not be able to continue the tax reductions over the next year. The indications of decreasing revenues and increasing expenses shown in the first 6 weeks quite properly furnishes a basis for calculations, but there are some administrative factors that have not been taken into account. The customs are temporarily lower because of anticipation of imports in advance of the passage of the tariff bill. Furthermore, we have been expediting the expenditure on construction work with view to giving maximum employment during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, in order that we might give the most work during the period of maximum unemployment. Further than that, these calculations take no account of the foreign debt payments which are likely to be very helpful this year. And they did not take into account the reduction in expenditure as the result of the drive we are making for the postponement--an actual reduction or economy--of such things as are not necessary at the present time. The reports of which are not in from all of the departments but so far as they have been received they indicate a probable cut of about $75 million in expenditure. One has to bear in mind in reducing the expenditure that about $2,200 million out of the $4,200 million of estimated expenditure this year is in respect to fixed charges for interest and debt redemption, pensions, et cetera. So that the field which we have to work in for economies is less than one-half of the total national expenditure. Out of that there is about $400 million of construction in one department or another, which we have been increasing rather than decreasing as a matter of employment, so that the field for revising expenditure for emergency is more limited on this occasion than most any other. I have an announcement to make for you, and that is that Mr. Henry p. Fletcher will be Chairman of the new Tariff Commission. He will take office at the expiration of the present commission, on September 16th. As you know, Mr. Fletcher has been in the Foreign Service of the Government for somewhere about 18 or 20 years.

{"id": 924, "text": "We will wind up with a program that may be marginally different than the one we have got, but it will in all probability have much less deficit reduction if we have to go into some sort of situation where we are paralyzed on this. So the real issue here-I think the reason that we have had so many Republican as well as Democratic business leaders supporting this is that they want a decision, they want certainty, they want real deficit reduction, and they think this meets all those criteria and also has some real incentives to grow the economy, and it will free us to move on to these other things. That is what I keep emphasizing to Members of Congress who say this is not perfect. I say, look, we have got a 4-year contract here to deal with all these problems, and you cannot expect this one bill to solve all the problems of the country. It will not carry that much water. ENTITY, since you brought up health care reform, what do you say to reassure Americans-looming over this budget package with its various tax increases is the specter of more increases to pay for health care. How can you reassure Americans that they are not getting ready to get hit by a one-two punch? First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured. Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what is going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I do not , myself, think that it is right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we are going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we are going to bring our costs down, we have got to cover everybody. An employer should bear some responsibility for their employees. And the employee should bear some responsibility, too. But my own view of that is that the best way to do that is to limit the ultimate cost to small business and phase any new requirements in over a period of years so that nobody is adversely affected too much. But let me say on that point, it is important to remember that 70 percent of the small businesses in America already provide some coverage to their employees.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "title": "Interview With Newspaper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-newspaper-editors-0", "publication_date": "02-08-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

It will be more challenging, but I still think that we may be able to do that simply because of the limits on their economic options. During the campaign you told me, in fact, almost the day it happened, when President Bush signed it in San Antonio, you said to me the next day that you supported this fair trade concept with Mexico and Canada on balance. You had some questions. Do you still have some questions? Yes, but I am still for it. As a matter of fact, I feel more strongly today, if possible, that it is the right direction for us to take.

It was negotiated with a greater concern for our financial institutions and our intellectual property concerns, that is, patent and copyright concerns, than for new jobs and environmental cleanup, things that I thought were real important. So we are trying to fix that. We are trying to make sure that this trade agreement with Mexico and Canada has very strong provisions to guarantee appropriate investments in environmental cleanups, so we do not have more pollution in America or we do not have people going down to Mexico just so they will not have to have any antipollution expenses, and so we have some labor protections. And I believe that the right kind of trade agreement can create jobs in America. I do not agree that it'll cost jobs. If you look just in the last couple of days, there was a notice from General Motors that they are closing an operation in Mexico, bringing it back to the United States, going to create 1,000 jobs in Michigan and higher labor costs because of the productivity and the nearness to the labor parts market, to the auto parts market.

You keep talking about limited, targeted military action, but the fact is you do not know what happens after you order a strike. And, you know, Mr. Assad's military capabilities are significant compared to a bunch of opposition leaders, many of whom are not professional fighters; they are significant relative to over 400 children that were gassed; they are not significant relative to the U.S. military. Some of their allies -- Iran, Hezbollah -- do have capacity to carry out asymmetrical strikes, but keep in mind that even Assad's allies recognize that he crossed the line in using chemical weapons. Iran itself was subjected to chemical weapons used by Saddam Hussein. There is a reason why almost the entire international community has signed a ban on chemical weapons, even during hot wars. And so my narrow concern right now is making sure that Assad does not use those chemical weapons again. And, you know, we have seen some indications from the Russians, as well as the Syrians today, that they may be willing to look at the prospect of getting those weapons under control, perhaps even international control, and getting them out of there where they could be vulnerable to use by anybody. And that is something that we are going to run to ground over the next couple of days. Well, let me ask you about that because there has been this interesting development today. The Russians say they are going to push Syria to put chemical weapons under international control. The Syrian foreign minister says he welcomes that. Will you delay a strike to see how that plays out? I think it is fair to say that we would not be at this point without a credible threat of a military strike, but I welcome the possibility of the development. And John Kerry will be talking to his Russian counterparts. I think we should explore and exhaust all avenues of diplomatic resolution of this. But I think it is important for us to keep the pressure on.

So, let me ask maybe more precisely, ENTITY, what would you tell the Polish Nation about the American attitude toward our efforts to achieve self-determination, about all those free elections which took place recently in Poland, about our achievements in gaining free speech and the restoration of our free will in Poland? Yes, I'd simply say the visit is a symbol of our support for Poland as it moves toward greater democracy. And I had a chance to make that point a couple of years ago and will make it again. I will state that we are encouraged by changes. I will try not to look like I am fine-tuning the internal affairs of Poland. I am not going to do that, but I think I have every right to say I am encouraged by the changes we have seen. Obviously, we followed the roundtable discussions and agreement, and salute that agreement. As you know, we are committed to representation by the people, of the people. And so, we see changes in the way elected representatives are chosen and go forward to represent their people we salute that. So, it will be in this vein, this thematic vein, that I will be talking. And in Poland, you know, there is an historic opportunity now to help end the postwar division of Europe. And if we handle ourselves correctly with the Soviet Union and if the changes continue that we are seeing, we could see a Europe that is freer and more whole.  Yes, and I talked about differentiation there. And, indeed, that Vienna trip led to my feeling very comfortable going with a similar message to Poland. ENTITY, already during the first few minutes of this interview, you used, several times, the word change, because everybody now sees the changes taking place in Poland. For some, the changes are too slow; for some, are too quick. But as a very experienced politician, you certainly know that good policy requires not only change but also some elements of stability that prevent the change from erupting, from being blown up and leading to some kind of a deep crisis. Would you like to comment about what elements of continuity in central and Eastern Europe would you like to see? Well, I'd like to see respect for the will of the people.

But our public life needs more of the spirit of reconciliation, it needs more civility, it needs more humility. Sometimes we think we know things we do not . And I think on debates over public issues, that is true as well. The American people very much want us to they respond to these negative things, but they do not like it. The reason it keeps happening is because they respond to it. The politicians read polls, you know, and they know very often that the negative campaigns work and elect people. And they know that if you just constantly demean and run down people, like, after a while it sticks. They know that, so they keep on doing it. And the people respond to it, but they hate it. It is almost saying, I wish you'd lock this liquor store up so I could not drink anymore.

It is always a nuisance to have the President of the United States around. He has to have certain special treatment, which is for the Presidency and not for the individual. Always bear in mind that the Presidency of this great Republic of ours is the greatest office in the history of the world. It is the most important office in the world, and the man in it must do everything he can to cause all the people, at home and abroad, to respect that office for what it is. World leadership came and was forced upon us, because we did not want to assume that responsibility we refused to assume that responsibility in 1920; and the Second World War was the result. Beginning in 1938 when Hitler went into Poland it began to dawn on the people at the head of the Government of the United States, that we had a place in the world which had to be filled. We are trying our best to fill that place in the world. You young men who will be the future generals, the men who will form the military policy of the United States, have a responsibility which you will have to assume just as soon as you finish your education. Now, this is your great school I was telling my young friends from Missouri here, that this school has produced some of the greatest men in the history of our country. This school has made a contribution that is one of the greatest in the history of the country. I am proud to be your guest today on that account. And I am just as proud and I am interpolating here of the Naval Academy and its cadets. I want to see you become the leaders and the citizens in our military setup that you should. General Bradley this afternoon is going to give you a lecture on what it means to be a graduate of this school, and what your responsibilities are, and what our military policy really is. Now I did not intend to give you a lecture on citizenship and the Presidency of the United States, but I thought maybe you would be interested in knowing that the President himself an individual like everybody else must keep his eye on the ball, in an effort to attain the respect for the office that it deserves.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksluncheonthecadetdininghallwestpoint", "title": "Remarks at a Luncheon in the Cadet Dining Hall at West Point.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-luncheon-the-cadet-dining-hall-west-point", "publication_date": "20-05-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

And when they have been asked about, they keep on promising, We are going to have a great replacement. It is been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years. Where is this great plan to replace Obamacare? They have had 10 years to do it. They have never had one.

I can tell you this, Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers. Who does that? He understands that.

It has become a showplace for progress, and a proving ground of methods to improve the lives of our fellow human beings. And, along the way, American Samoa has taken the term self-help out of the bureaucrats' dictionary and made it a living language for their people. You have doubled the per-acre yield of your crops. You have sharply reduced the diseases that once plagued your island.

This defense is being used more and more in murder trials.

Fifty percent of the deficit is occasioned by the recession, the fact that people, instead of being employed and paying taxes, suddenly became dependents, you might say, of government because they were no longer working and paying taxes-the great increase in unemployment that took place. There was one other thing that none of us could foresee, and again it comes down to projections. None of us ever dreamed that we could be as successful in lowering inflation as we were. And you must realize that inflation accounts for some of your tax revenue-the bracket-squeeze that takes place on people. And our tax revenues dropped below what had been projected by us because of the effect of the reduced inflation. So, we had to readjust our projections based on how far down we had brought inflation. So, we did not foresee that. I still believe that, in spite of this setback, that we can-and with the cooperation of Congress, proceeding on the same lines involving both further spending, getting the spending measures or the cuts that we asked for and have not yet gotten. Remember, our deficits would be considerably smaller if Congress had given us all the cuts in spending that we asked for. But we are going to continue on that path. And we are going to continue looking at the longer range on planning and reviewing those things that you might say are structural changes in government that have not been dealt with as yet, so that you do not have a built-in increase in spending that is-well, as Congress itself refers to it-as uncontrollable. You know, if you pass something that guarantees a constant increase in spending, and you have passed the measure, and then you never have to lay hands on it again, it just automatically keeps increasing.

In his lonely vigil up at the top of that mountain--let us not try to go back to what he may have been thinking through those ages before our civilization first discovered him--150 years ago he saw great ox carts going through these roads where now we travel in an instant. He saw the fastest means of transportation--the horse. Finally he saw stage coaches. He saw only here and there a habitation, a sparsely settled wilderness. He has seen mankind go from the sailing ship and from the horse and buggy to the jet airplane and the ability to cross the ocean in a few hours.

But you have got to make up your mind. And you cannot pretend that there are no consequences to this election. You know, one of the things I really respect about Chuck Robb is, he is a fiscal conservative; he voted with me on that budget, knowing it could beat him in the '94 election. He did not blink; he got up there and voted in '93 for the budget. And if he had not voted for it, it would have never passed. But also, after his distinguished career in the United States Marine Corps, he has supported me on every human rights initiative, including gay rights, I have ever advanced. And I respect that more than I can say. And he has supported sensible efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. Yesterday Hillary and I had-and I like it, because Al Gore and I need some Southern cover, you know.

You know, I just want to take a minute. This is a big choice you have got in the election. But do not let anybody you know pretend that they are voting-the Senate race or the President's race is not about what our policy is with regard to safety, public safety, or pretend that it is not about our policy with regard to human rights or pretend that it is not about our policy with regard to economics and whether you like having this surplus and you want to get America out of debt and keep investing in education or you'd rather go back and try it the way it was. I am telling you, those are three inescapable consequences of this election and your choice. Will we change economic policy? Will we continue to try to make America a safer country and have responsible measures to promote gun safety? Will we continue to advance the cause of human rights? And the fourth inescapable consequence is, will we continue to grow the economy and improve the environment at the same time or let the old way prevail, and say the heck with that?", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksreceptionforsenatorcharlessrobb", "title": "Remarks at a Reception for Senator Charles S.

It will get better, but you will always have to work on it. If they work at it I think it will get better. But I think you will, first of all, people will always tend to show a certain affinity to organize their living patterns around people who are more like them. But some people will seek a more integrated life. That is my experience in the South; that is my experience in America. I mean, I was amazed when I traveled around in other parts of America that a lot of people that I knew in other parts of the country lived a more segregated existence than I did, for whatever reason, maybe just the nature of the population of their communities. But I think there will always be a certain amount of cohesion of people of the same race or ethnic group or religious group, particularly if they have strong religious convictions. You see that all over the world. You see that here. To a certain extent, there is nothing wrong with that and it is not unhelpful. What is unhelpful is if that is used as a way to divide people and if it leads to some sort of legal or practical discrimination. And I think what Mr. Lewis is saying is absolutely right. We still have too much of that in America. We had a meeting here this morning, just for example, we had a meeting this morning; we had a couple of hundred people in the Rose Garden to talk about how we could better immunize all of our children in America. And it is appalling that a country as wealthy as we are only immunizes about two-thirds of our kids, about 64 percent of our children under 2 with all the recommended childhood immunizations. And it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that one of the reasons is that children under 2 are more likely to be children of color and more likely to be poor than adults over 50 who tend to make the decisions that control public policy in this country. So we had a meeting today to celebrate trying to organize ourselves with some discipline at the community level to eradicate not only a health problem but a problem of discrimination against the young, the poor, and often, children of color.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjournalistssouthafrica", "title": "William J.

You have assured the people in this country and in Tibet that you are taking a message to the Chinese. What is new about this message?

But I think I would still caution the Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress from passing some big 5year program to spend money through spending programs or tax cuts that has not yet materialized.

Well, I cannot really talk about what we are doing, because I do not want to do anything that will endanger the prospects of the others being freed. I can only say that we have explored every avenue.

Some cynics might say that, but they do not know the facts. The facts are, if the Democrats had done what they are willing to do now, we could have had a bill 2 months ago and should have. But they asked me to bust the budget agreement and further tax the 94 percent of the people that are working. And by standing up and saying, No, we are not going to do it that way. We are going to beat back the liberal idea that you can just keep on spending forever, that got us partially in the mix we are in now. And so, I had to stand up against it. But now, apparently, we have got a deal. But I do not think somebody will charge that because they can see the evidence of the legislation. You are familiar with this Times-Mirror poll that was taken that showed this drop in popularity. There was another statistic in that poll that is disturbing to some, that 39 percent of those polled are afraid that some member of their family is going to lose their job. And is not it very difficult for people to spend money to stimulate the economy when they live with this fear What do we do about that? What we do about it is passing the incentive programs that I have got up before the Congress. It is long overdue that they go out in my opinion. And then I will make some proposals at the State of the Union message and take my case directly to the American people. And I think they will support me. But even if they are not, I am going to have a program that I will say look the American people in the eye and say, Look, they have tried it their way. I have had to block some of the lousy ideas that the Democratic leadership has come up with. Now, you back me, and let us try to get it done. Interest rates are down, and today yet there is another very important credit card company came down on their rates.

So instead of sending in the Marines to turn the water on, we sent one admiral in to cut it off and arrange to make our own water, and we think things worked out as best they could under those circumstances.

They have produced a serious and comprehensive report, and I welcome their recommendations. Indeed, we have already put into action many of the steps now recommended by the Commission, and we will carefully examine all the Commission's ideas on how we can improve our ongoing efforts to protect America and to prevent another attack. The events of September the 11th, 2001, dramatically demonstrated the threats of a new era. In the nearly 3 years since the attacks, we have waged a steady, relentless, determined war on terrorists. We are fighting them in foreign lands so we do not have to face them here in America, and we are taking unprecedented steps to defend the homeland. Since September 2001, America and our allies have captured or killed thousands of terrorists, removed terrorist regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, convinced Libya to give up its weapons of mass destruction, and put the world's most dangerous nuclear trading network out of business. We are chasing down terrorist enemies abroad and within our own borders. On the homefront, we have dismantled terrorist cells and prosecuted terrorist supporters from California to Florida to Massachusetts. As the Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean, said this week, We are safer today than we were on 9/11. But as Governor Kean also noted, The danger to America has not passed. And no matter how good our defenses are, a determined enemy can still strike us. Yet all Americans can be certain our Government is using every resource and technological advantage we have to prevent future attacks. We have created a new Department of Homeland Security with a single mission, protecting the American people. We have established better communications networks to make information on rapidly emerging threats available to local officials in real time. We are transforming the FBI into an agency whose primary focus is stopping terrorism. And we created a new Northern Command in the Department of Defense with the mission of defending the American homeland. To better protect the country, we have posted Homeland Security personnel at foreign ports, beefed up airport and seaport security at home, and instituted better visa screening for those entering our country. We have placed state-of-the-art equipment in major cities to detect biological agents and stockpiled enough smallpox vaccine for every American, in case of an emergency.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress801", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-801", "publication_date": "24-07-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

We have got to tackle some of these things like health care, energy, and education that have been put off for too long. I have a question about NASA, in honor of the Discovery launch tonight. Right now, the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 is going to devastate the space coast economy down in Florida. You are looking at about 3,500 job losses, at the least, at the center, which will multiply to as many as 28,000 jobs throughout that entire area. Right now, you reaffirmed ENTITY Bush's decision to retire the shuttle in 2010. I guess what I want to know is why you decided to keep that 2010 retirement date for the shuttle and what type of plans you may have to try to save the space coast from an economic crater? Well, first of all, we have authorized, and we are budgeted for, additional shuttle launches that had not been scheduled. And so we are extending the life of the shuttle, because, A, I think it is doing some important work, and B, we are very mindful of the economic impact of the space program in the region. I will soon be appointing a new NASA director. I think it is important for the long-term vibrancy of our space program to think through what NASA's core mission is and what the next great adventures and discoveries are under the NASA banner. NASA has yielded or the space shuttle program has yielded some extraordinary scientific discoveries. But I think it is fair to say that there is been a sense of drift to our space program over the last several years. We need to restore that sense of excitement and interest that existed around the space program. And shaping a mission for NASA that is appropriate for the 21st century is going to be one of the biggest tasks of my new NASA director.

Well, first of all, Roosevelt sent those people after Pearl Harbor, after there was an attack and after Germany declared war on the United States, when the whole future of Europe was at stake. What has happened here is that European nations under the U.N. mandate have gone into Bosnia not for the purpose of ending the war but for the purpose of preserving the U.N. mission of preserving some limitation on the fighting and some humanitarian aid. We have acted in support of that in several ways. We have provided through our air power the longest humanitarian airlift in history, now longer than the Berlin airlift. We have worked hard to get our NATO allies to agree to use not only the threat but the reality of air power to stop the war in Bosnia from spreading to the air. We have shot down planes in aid of that objective to protect Sarajevo and other safe areas. And we are aggressively involved with our European allies in trying to get a peace agreement. I do not think it is an appropriate thing for the United States to send ground troops to Bosnia to become involved in the conflict itself. Now, if we reach an agreement in which NATO has a responsibility to enforce the agreement along lines agreed to by the parties, that is a different matter altogether. The United States still has troops in the Middle East enforcing the agreement reached by Israel and Egypt at the Camp David accord. If we are talking about limiting the conflict, we have troops now in Macedonia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, designed to limit the conflict. I think that that is the appropriate thing for us. I think the Europeans have done the right thing in putting their troops in in the U.N. mandate to try to limit the fighting. But in the end, these parties are going to have to make an agreement. Otherwise, there is a risk that they will collapse the U.N. mission. They are going to have to decide that they cannot win, either side, by fighting and make an agreement. They reached an agreement tentatively before the terrible problems in Gorazde.

At that time he said, and I want to quote his words, we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. That very simple statement still expresses the purposes of this wonderful program, though the social security system has grown vastly larger since 1935. Today, as we meet here, more than an million Americans find social security benefit checks in their mailboxes each month. This represents more than $1 1/3 billion a month, more than $16 billion a year, providing a much more secure life for our citizens and contributing a great deal of economic soundness to our economic system. Millions of other Americans at their jobs each day are building up future benefits and looking forward to the day when they will qualify. Franklin Roosevelt called the original Social Security Act, and I quote, a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete. That is true today as it was 30 years ago when President Roosevelt stated it. We are working steadily with the enlightened Members of the Senate and the Congress and the Cabinet here with me this morning to build and to strengthen the social security system. Legislation has already passed the House of Representatives--it is now pending in the Senate--which will provide increased monthly benefits to retired persons, to widows, to orphans, and to the disabled. This year, for the first time, health insurance protection for persons of 65 and over will become a part of America's social security system. I believe that most Americans are looking forward with me to the day when these great measures are signed into law. In this country we all believe that every man wants dignity and a decent life, and not a dole. We believe that every man wants a fair chance, and not charity. We believe that older Americans have earned and deserve peace of mind, not pain and panic, when misfortune strikes. The social security system, and the historic legislation that is now pending in the Senate, are our testaments to those beliefs.

I know the conventional wisdom is that the Vice President's position was purely political, but he talked to me-I do not know, a day or two after Elian Gonzalez's case became public, weeks and weeks and weeks ago, and said, You know, I am very worried about this process.

I mean, there are a lot of reasons for it, but I think there are some indications that we have had some real ability to manage this. But I think the most important thing to remember is that the underlying fundamentals have been good because of the productivity of the American people and our willingness to compete.

He abandoned our friends in Poland by walking away from our missile defense commitments, but is eager to give Russia's President Putin the flexibility he desires, after the election.

So I knew what was ahead if we acted in Korea. But after all this was said, we realized that the issue was whether there would be fighting in a limited area now or on a much larger scale later on--whether there would be some casualties now or many more casualties later. So a decision was reached--the decision I believe was the most important in my time as ENTITY. In the days that followed, the most heartening fact was that the American people clearly agreed with the decision. And in Korea, our men are fighting as valiantly as Americans have ever fought-because they know they are fighting in the same cause of freedom in which Americans have stood ever since the beginning of the Republic. Where free men had failed the test before, this time we met the test. We met it firmly. We met it successfully. The Communists have seen their hopes of easy conquest go down the drain. The determination of free people to defend themselves has been made clear to the Kremlin. As I have thought about our worldwide struggle with the Communists these past 8 years--day in and day out--I have never once doubted that you, the people of our country, have the will to do what is necessary to win this terrible fight against communism. I know the people of this country have that will and determination, and I have always depended on it. Because I have been sure of that, I have been able to make necessary decisions even though they called for sacrifices by all of us. And I have not been wrong in my judgment of the American people.

The right kind of tax cut is one that is targeted to people who need it, focused on building strong families and educating people so that they will be more productive, they will grow the economy, they will be stronger, and is paid for in a balanced budget.

As we all know, this has been a very difficult time in Afghanistan, to not only carry out a election under difficult circumstances, where there were a whole host of security issues that had to be resolved, but also postelection, a lot of uncertainty. President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done. And so I expressed the American people's appreciation for this step. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in Afghanistan. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the IEC and the ECC in Afghanistan complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process. I also want to commend Senator John Kerry, who was in the region traveling and ended up working extensively with Ambassador Eikenberry and was extraordinarily constructive and very helpful. So I think he deserves great congratulations. Moving forward, we will continue to work with our ISAF partners as well as the Afghan Government, however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the Afghan that we can move Afghanistan towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the Afghan people is ultimately done. So we are pleased with the steps that have been taken today, and we hope that we can build on this progress.

We have plenty of big ideas and technical solutions from both sides of the aisle. That is not what is holding us back. What is holding us back is a stalemate in Washington. Last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill full of the kinds of bipartisan ideas that could have put over a million Americans back to work and helped bolster our economy against outside shocks. I sent them a plan that would have reduced our deficit by $4 trillion in a balanced way that pays for the investments we need by cutting unnecessary spending and by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more in taxes. Since then, Congress has passed a few parts of that jobs bill, like a tax cut that is allowing working Americans to keep more of your paycheck every week. But on most of the ideas that would create jobs and grow our economy, Republicans in Congress have not lifted a finger. They'd rather wait until after the election in November. Just this past week, one of them said, Why not wait for the reinforcements? That is a quote, and you can bet plenty of his colleagues are thinking the same thing.

{"id": 2305, "text": "By passing CAFTA, the United States would open up a market of 44 million consumers for our farmers and small-business people and entrepreneurs. By lowering barriers in key segments like textiles, CAFTA will put our region in a better position to compete with low-cost producers in Asia. For the young democracies of Central America and the Dominican Republic, CAFTA would continue the current trade benefits. That means good jobs and higher labor standards for their workers. And because of reduced tariffs on U.S. goods, consumers in these countries would have access to better goods at lower prices. And that brings us a step closer to our goal of an Americas where the opportunities in San Jose, Costa Rica, are as real as they are in San Jose, California. People have got to understand that by promoting policy that will help generate wealth in Central America, we are promoting policy that will mean someone is less- more likely to stay at home to find a job. If you are concerned about immigration to this country, then you must understand that CAFTA and the benefits of CAFTA will help create new opportunity in Central American countries, which will mean someone will be able to find good work at home, somebody will be able to provide for their family at home, as opposed to having to make the long trip to the United States. For the Western Hemisphere, CAFTA would bring the stability and security that can only come from freedom. That is what we are interested in. We are interested in spreading freedom. Today, a part of the world that was once characterized by oppression and military dictatorship sees its future in democratic elections and free and fair trade, and we cannot take these gains for granted. These small nations are making big and brave commitments, and America must continue to support them. And CAFTA is a good way to support them. CAFTA is good for our workers. It is good for our farmers. It is good for our small-business people, but it is equally as good for the folks in Central America. By transforming our hemisphere into a powerful trading area, CAFTA will help promote democracy, security, and prosperity. The United States was built on freedom, and the more of it we have in our own backyard, the freer and safer and more prosperous America will be. The leaders from both parties here today share this vision.

By helping to bring Vietnam into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful Vietnam in a stable and peaceful Asia. We will begin to normalize our trade relations with Vietnam, whose economy is now liberalizing and integrating into the economy of the Asia-Pacific region. Our policy will be to implement the appropriate United States Government programs to develop trade with Vietnam consistent with U.S. law. As you know, many of these programs require certifications regarding human rights and labor rights before they can proceed. We have already begun discussing human rights issues with Vietnam, especially issues regarding religious freedom. Now we can expand and strengthen that dialog. The Secretary of State will go to Vietnam in August where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our POW and MIA concerns. I believe normalization and increased contact between Americans and Vietnamese will advance the cause of freedom in Vietnam, just as it did in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I strongly believe that engaging the Vietnamese on the broad economic front of economic reform and the broad front of democratic reform will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in Vietnam. I am proud to be joined in this view by distinguished veterans of the Vietnam war. They served their country bravely. They are of different parties. A generation ago they had different judgments about the war which divided us so deeply. But today they are of a single mind. They agree that the time has come for America to move forward on Vietnam. All Americans should be grateful especially that Senators John McCain, John Kerry, Bob Kerrey, Chuck Robb, and Representative Pete Peterson, along with other Vietnam veterans in the Congress, including Senator Harkin, Congressman Kolbe, and Congressman Gilchrest, who just left, and others who are out here in the audience have kept up their passionate interest in Vietnam but were able to move beyond the haunting and painful past toward finding common ground for the future. Today they and many other veterans support the normalization of relations, giving the opportunity to Vietnam to fully join the community of nations and being true to what they fought for so many years ago. Whatever we may think about the political decisions of the Vietnam era, the brave Americans who fought and died there had noble motives.

This morning we talked to the young people over at the University of Rhode Island about their rights, about civil rights, about constitutional rights. But we also talked about the responsibilities that go with those rights and the understanding that goes with them.

I am a believer that Yucca Mountain is a scientifically sound place to send the waste, and I would hope that the United States Congress would recognize that as well. I also recognize that we can do something on a reprocessing front. And so I got our administration to commit to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. Under the partnership, America is going to work with nations that have already got an advanced civilian nuclear energy program, such as France and Japan and Russia, and we are going to use new technologies that effectively and safely recycle spent nuclear fuel. In other words, we are coming together to say, how can we do a better job of reprocessing and recycling fuel? And the reason that is important, at least for our fellow citizens to understand, is it will reduce the amount of the toxicity of the fuel and reduce the amount we have to store. To me, it is a smart way to combine with others to reduce storage requirements for nuclear waste by up to 90 percent. It is a good way to work with other nations that are spending money on research and development as well. It is a way to, kind of, leverage up an investment. We are going to I have asked Congress to spend $250 million on this partnership. I hope they follow through with it.

More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists. We are disrupting their command and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move. We are destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations. We are taking out their commanders, their fighters, and their leaders. In Iraq, local forces have largely held the line and, in some places, have pushed ISIL back. In Syria, ISIL failed in its major push to take the town of Kobani, losing countless fighters in the process, fighters who will never again threaten innocent civilians. And we have seen reports of sinking morale among ISIL fighters as they realize the futility of their cause. Now, make no mistake, this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time. It is going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas. But our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose. Its barbaric murders of so many people, including American hostages, are a desperate and revolting attempt to strike fear in the hearts of people it can never possibly win over by its ideas or its ideology, because it offers nothing but misery and death and destruction. With our allies and partners, we are going to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.

If the Congress can improve on it, I am more than glad to cooperate with them. But the time for action had come, and that is why I took the rather stern action today. ENTITY, you have been quite adamant in your resistance to some of the proposals that have come from Congress. For instance, a number of the leaders, including Mike Mansfield, have talked seriously about gas rationing, and the White House opposition and criticism of gas rationing has been, I think, clear to everyone. You just would not sign it under any conditions. So, where is the give-and-take in the program? Well, ENTITY, I think you bring up the very fundamental question that I had to decide as we worked for about 2 months on what was the best approach, as we saw it. What are we trying to do? We are trying to conserve energy in the first instance, and we are trying to provide funds for exploration and development of new sources of energy. And we are seeking, basically, to remove our country's vulnerability from foreign oil and energy sources. I was presented with two volumes of options, or alternatives, covering the whole spectrum of conservation and new sources of energy. We took a look at gas rationing. We took a look at the allocation of crude oil and the derivative products. In the case of gas rationing, here is what I found, and I think it is accurate. I found, for example, that it would not be gas rationing for 6 months or a year. This is a 10-year program of conservation. So when we put gas rationing on, it would have to be for a minimum of 5 years and probably 10 years. Well, in World War II, we had gas rationing for 4 or 5 years during a serious crisis, and even then we had black marketeering, we had cheating.

I was as surprised as anyone when suddenly the announcement was made that in a month we have increased the unemployed by 500,000. Now, as you know, there is no accurate way of counting the unemployed. There is an accurate way of counting the people who are in the work force. And it is difficult for me to understand this sudden surge of unemployment when, at the same time, there are 266,000 more people employed in the work force than there were on January 20th, when this administration started. I cannot believe that we have suddenly added three-quarters of a million people to our population. But let me point out one reason why there could be some fluctuations. First of all, any unemployed, other than those who are voluntarily between jobs, is too much. So, I do not want to sound callous about that. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that is harder for me to do than to think of putting somebody out of a job. I came into the work force myself in the depths of the Great Depression. I saw what took place there. But unemployment is determined by some 60-odd thousand telephone calls, like a Nielsen rating on a TV show, throughout the country-random. And the question is, Is anyone in the household looking for work? And on the basis of these calls and the percentage, the percentage of unemployed is determined. Suppose it is a housewife who says to you on the phone, Well, you know, the children are getting along now and if I could find something that did not interfere with family and was right, yes. Well, the person can put that down as she is looking for work, or the person from this end of the phone can put that down as no. Nor are we dividing between all those teenagers, that on the other end of the phone someone might answer and say, Well, my son would love to have an after-school job if he could find one, and so you can put him down unemployed. The millions of unemployed are not, all of them, heads of household, leading a family without earnings.

And now, they gave us this. I think part of it is how you view power. But for whatever reason, there is something about me that they did not like very much. Like I said, I am sure that my not being familiar with Washington mores may have had something to do with the way I did not handle the press right. Yes, you know I mean, I have said this in print, so I can say it to your face. That is the other thing we know about you. But I think in the beginning, for the first 2 years, I thought I was pushing a lot of rocks up the hill. Thomas Patterson, who has written books about the Presidency and the media and all that, he said in '95 that I'd already kept a higher percentage of my campaign promises than the previous five Presidents, which I felt really good about. We had just lost the Congress. I needed something to feel good about.

For 3 years, depending on the headlines, the poll numbers, and political calculation, he has taken almost every conceivable position on Iraq. First, he said Saddam Hussein was a threat, and he voted for the war. Then he voted against funds for bullets and body armor for the troops he had voted to send into battle. Months later, he said that knowing everything we know now, he would have still voted for the war. Having gone back and forth so many times, the Senator from Massachusetts has now flip-flopped his way to a dangerous position. My opponent finally has settled on a strategy, a strategy of retreat. He has talked about artificial timetables to pull our troops out of Iraq. He has sent the signal that America's overriding goal in Iraq would be to leave, even if the job is not done. And that approach would lead to a major defeat in the war on terror. So long as I am the Commander in Chief, America will never retreat in the face of the terrorists. We will keep our word to the Iraqi people. We will make sure Iraqi forces can defend their country, and then American troops will return home with the honor they have earned. My opponent wants to weaken the PATRIOT Act and has a history of trying to undermine our intelligence services. I will take every necessary measure to protect the homeland. The Senator wants to wage the war on terror on the defensive. I will take the fight to the enemy. The Senator insults our friends in the world and wants to please a few critics. I am working with our friends for the sake of freedom and security. The Senator is skeptical and pessimistic about democracy in Iraq and critical of our efforts in the broader Middle East. I know that the advance of freedom is the path to security and peace. In all these areas, my opponent's views would make America less secure and the world more dangerous. And none of these positions should come as a surprise. Over a 20-year career in the United States Senate, Senator Kerry has been consistently wrong on the major national security issues facing our country. The Senator who voted against the $87 billion for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq is the same Senator who has voted against vital weapons systems during his entire career. He tried to cancel the Patriot missile, which shot down Scud missiles in Operation Desert Storm.

And even more important, knowing as we all do-every person in this room knows that while Social Security is absolutely stable for the people who are now on it and the people who are about to go on it, when all the baby boomers get in, it is not sustainable under the present circumstances because there will only be two people working for every one person drawing Social Security. Everybody in this room between the ages of 52 and 34 is a baby boomer. Either we will have to put a whopping tax increase on our kids to maintain the system as it is, undermining their ability to raise our grandchildren, which none of us want to do; or we will have to take a whopping cut in Social Security benefits, which today keeps one-half of the senior citizens in America out of poverty. So I say, tempting though it is before an election to shovel up a little tax cut, let us show a little restraint and a little knowledge of the last 29 years and say, No, no, we are going to save Social Security first before we spend it. And believe me, the elections will send a message to the Congress about which path you wish to take. I talked about it all day today, and I never thought I'd come to Philadelphia or go anyplace in America in a political election and say, The big issue is, are we going to fund the IMF? Sounds like those people that make bowling equipment. The International Monetary Fund is a fund to which we and others contribute that helps countries that are poorer and developing, who have good policies, to try to grow their economy; or when they get in trouble, it tries to help them work out of trouble without just being absolutely destroyed. For 8 months I have been trying to get America to make its fair share of contribution. Because we cannot lead the world-and you know the troubles that Asia has; you know the troubles in Russia; you see the impact, how it echoes in Latin America, our fastest growing market for American products. You see people say, when the stock market changes here, that that has something to do with this financial trouble overseas.

There will be some institutions that continue to be weak, and we are going to have to do something with them. Over time, as the market confidence is restored, then what we can do is start getting rid of some of these assets, some of the stock the taxpayers now have in some of these companies start being worth more. We sell them off to private parties, and taxpayers can recoup that money. So you know, it is going to have to happen in stages.

Would you entertain a question based on the reported Israeli desire for a threefold increase in our aid to them? The United States, over the years, has been very generous in economic and military aid for Israel. On the other hand, we have been quite generous to a number of Arab nations. The State of Israel does need adequate military capability to protect its boundaries or its territorial integrity. I think because of the commonality of interest that we have with Israel in the Middle East that it is in our interest as well as theirs to be helpful to them, both militarily and economically. ENTITY, I wonder if we can come back at you again about Israel's security in another way. As you know, reporters do not give up easily on some of these questions. I found that out, ENTITY. On a long-range basis, do you think that it is possible for Israel to be truly secure in the Middle East without a United States guarantee of some kind? Well, of course, Israel, to my knowledge, ENTITY, has never asked for any U.S. manpower or any guarantee from us for their security or their territorial integrity. I think the Israelis, if they are given adequate arms and sufficient economic help, can handle the situation in the Middle East. Now, the last war, unfortunately, was much more severe from their point of view than the three previous ones. And I suspect that with the Arabs having more sophisticated weapons and probably a better military capability, another war might even be worse. That is one reason why we wish to accelerate the efforts to find some answers over there. But I think the Israelis, with adequate equipment and their determination and sufficient economic aid, will not have to have U.S. guarantees of any kind. I wonder if we can move to another area in the world, or would you like to go back to the Middle East? I have one question I would like to put to ENTITY.

And the other question I have is it seems as though sometimes your pitch, or the White House pitch, is you are almost a victim in this. You are not responsible when you have gotten so much past. I just wonder if you think that is effective to say, it is those mean Republicans who are blocking me, when you have really gotten a lot done? Well what we have gotten done I am enormously proud of and it is making a difference, and in some cases we have had a chance to actually work with the Republicans. When they show themselves willing to actually engage to try and get stuff done, then we can do a lot of good for the country. We just signed a series of trade agreements that potentially can create tens of thousands of jobs throughout this country so that we are starting to sell cars in South Korea and not just buy cars from South Korea. We just passed a bill to reform our patent system so our entrepreneurs are able to make sure that they are rewarded for the great ideas that they have and get them to market quicker. So wherever we can find areas of common cause, I am ready and willing to work with them right away. But I do not say that we are victimized, I say that we got too little of the kind of let us work together attitude in Washington that we need, and that has been true since I came into office. And that is just a fact, that the truth of the matter is that on a series of very important measures that could make a big difference, the most prominent being right now is putting people back to work, rebuilding our infrastructure, getting teachers back in the classroom, we have not seen that attitude of cooperation that is necessary. The fact of the matter is, in the absence of some Republican support, they are able to block proposals even if they have gotten the support of the majority of American people. Sixty-three percent of the American people support the elements of my jobs plan, they support the idea that we should have the best infrastructure in the world.

We do have to monitor the massive investments, particularly if those investments from Middle Eastern countries involve, for example, defense producers those companies that have a substantial business with the Department of Defense. On the other hand, I see offhand no reason why one or more of these Middle Eastern countries should not buy the bonds of Knoxville or the State of Tennessee or the city of Detroit. They have to make the judgment as to whether it is a good investment, and I see no ill coming from the investors from a foreign country having bonds issued by a local community in Tennessee or Michigan or elsewhere.

Oftentimes, what we found out was kids with great hearts were graduating from schools but could not read. I challenged the soft bigotry of low expectations by raising the bar, insisting on high standards, by making sure the money we spentand we did spend more moneywent to help those who needed extra help early, before it was too late.

How do you balance a cash award in this announcement today to one company with its potential negative job impact on a competitor? No, I disagree with that. For one thing, these awards are designed to develop defense technologies for commercial purposes. And they were the result of a competitive process. For those who were not picked, let me say we are coming back next year with over $500 million in new funds for these kinds of projects, and we will be doing more. But the reason it is important to do it this way is that we have all these defense technologies that need to be put to work in the commercial sector. And in terms of the award in San Diego, let me remind you that there are literally thousands of bridges in this country, thousands, that need repair and a lot of new ones that need to be built. So if this technology can be put to work in doing that, they should not be able to push anybody else with a genuinely competitive product out of the market, because there are so many thousands of bridges that need repair and cities and local governments and States are just beginning to face up to those responsibilities and because in the 1980's this country walked away from its infrastructure needs. So, I do not see that as a problem, particularly in this sector of the economy. You mentioned awards to Redondo Beach, Fullerton, I believe two others. Most of the awards, though, were out of State. We have 250,000 defense jobs that were lost here. What do you say to those people who need help? Most of the awards were out of State, but California got the lion's share of the awards, ran away with the contest, as well you would expect, because there are so many defense workers out of work and because there is so much technology capacity. So the State did very well on this first round, and I would expect that there will be more in the second, third, and fourth rounds. Keep in mind, this was just the first of four rounds between now and November, and then next year we will have another $500 million-plus to put in a whole new round of these projects.

Jack Vessey always remembered the soldiers in the ranks; he understood those soldiers are the backbone of any army. He noticed them, spoke to them, looked out for them. Jack Vessey never forgot what it was like to be an enlisted man, to be just a GI. Mark J. Neal, of Las Cruces, New Mexico, remembers. In January of 1975, he was a private at Fort Carson, a member of the drill team there. He said recently that after one drill team event, he was in his residence doing dishes before the volunteer army, way back when Jack and I enlisted, it seems to me they had another name for doing dishes. Anyway, Mark Neal was told the commanding general wanted to see him. He was scared, of course, but he found his meeting and friendly chat with the general something he would always remember. After that, Mark Neal followed General Vessey's career. This short meeting made a lasting impression on me. It was amazing to me that you even knew I was on the premises... even more amazing that you would want to meet me.

That is, the general thrust of saying that we need more sensitivity on the part of everybody in our culture-all the cultural influences in society, not just movies and not just records but all cultural influences in terms of the welfare of our children and their future, I think that is accurate. Now, having said that, let me remind you that this was an issue that I raised before when I was Governor in the 1992 campaign. In '93, instead of attacking Hollywood, I came to Hollywood and challenged the people here-and in television, which I think is a bigger problem just because kids watch more of it-to join with me in trying to deal with this issue. And one of the things that came out of that meeting- and I want to compliment the networks on this-I think the major networks and I believe Fox was involved with this-commissioned UCLA to do an annual study of the violent content of television programs. And UCLA recently issued their first report. So that is something positive that the networks are doing. Now we will have to see-will they act on those reports. But again, you do not want laws. No, I am not interested in censorship. What I am interested in is asking all of us in American society to be accountable for what we do. The more freedom you have, the more responsibility you have to exercise, in any area of life. And I think these things should become open for public debate, not because we want to gag people with laws, not because we want to be unrealistic but because our children, large numbers of our children are in deep trouble, and we all ought to be trying to rescue as many of them as we can and give them a good start in life. You are listening to ENTITY with ENTITY. Brandon, I'd say you are off to a good start just the way you handled the question. I want to compliment you for calling in and-- By the way, it is appropriate because the ENTITY planned on being ENTITY when he was 6. It is not so, but it is not too soon for you to think about it.

It is been suggested you have only 6 to 18 months to accomplish your agenda before your postelection honeymoon with the Congress ends. What is your strategy to capitalize on your victory with an even more recalcitrant Congress, particularly after the 1986 congressional elections? Does not this threaten the completion of the ENTITY revolution? Well, I have never thought that the completion of what we have been trying to accomplish is going to be easy, particularly as long as there is in the House a definite majority of the other side. On the other hand, we have accomplished, I think, a great deal. We'd be much further ahead if we'd gotten all that we'd asked for from the very beginning, but we are going to keep right on with those things and see what we can do. First of all, I think we have to go after some budget reforms. The budgeting process is just a kind of a chaotic thing and, finally, you get a package of appropriation bills. Until we can have a budgeting process where you start out and set a figure as to what overall can be spent and, then, within that, negotiate out as to which program gets how much and arrive at a consensus on that, we are going to be in trouble. We need to do that. We need the balanced budget amendment; we need the line-item veto if we are to do those things. We need economic growth for that. We have got to have the tax simplification program that we have been studying and working on. We have got to have such things as enterprise zones-everything that will help stimulate the growth of the economy, because that is the sure way back to sensible running of the Government. And we have got the-it goes without saying-the defense and the security assistance measures and so forth. That we have to have. That is the top priority of government in the sense that that is the main constitutional requirement, is the security of the people. And then there are social things that I think we want, having to do with abortion, school prayer, tuition tax credits, things of that kind.

But other than that, I do not think it is the place of the Federal Government to intervene in the marketplace. So, you would not make a judgment whether or not it is a good thing? ENTITY, approximately a year ago four American churchwomen, two of them from Cleveland, were killed in El Salvador. Since then the Salvadoran Government has been holding some soldiers for questioning. Now, they recently released a report that contained little new and did not contain anything on the events after February 17th, which was before the soldiers were arrested. Are you satisfied with the way the Salvadoran Government has handled this situation? I have to tell you that I do not have an answer to that. This does not mean I have not been interested and we have not been trying to keep track. I have not had the latest report back on this situation. I do know that earlier we were informed that there was no real hard evidence with regard to the people who had been arrested. Now, I would have to and will, of course attempt to find out what we know about this, and we have been keeping close track of it. I think that the Duarte government is trying very hard to have a democratic regime and to bring about a political settlement of this war that is going on down there, not a military settlement.

And here is my assessment of not just the vote in Massachusetts, but the mood around the country. The same thing that swept Scott Brown into office swept me into office. Not just because of what is happened in the last year or two years, but what is happened over the last eight years. You have got really hard-working folks all across the country, who have seen their wages flat line and their incomes flat line. Then suddenly you have got this bank crisis in which their 401Ks are evaporating, their home values -- their single-biggest investment -- is collapsing. And here in Washington -- from their perspective -- the only thing that happens is that we bail out the banks. But you are in charge, now. No, keep in mind the point that I am making here. It was the right thing to do for us to salvage the financial system, and I make no apologies for that, at all. But we knew at the time how politically toxic that was. What it gave people a sense of is, We are spending all this money, but I am not getting any help. And, Gosh -- I wanted Obama to come in there to start making sure that I was getting help; not the big special-interest and the institutions. Now if I tell them, Well, it turns out that we will actually have gotten TARP paid back and that we are going to make sure that a fee's imposed on the big banks, so that this thing will cost taxpayers not a dime, that is helpful. But it does not eliminate the sense that their voices are not heard, and that institutions are betraying them. And I think that is been expressing itself all year. And they have gotten increasingly frustrated over the course of the year.

In order to be a vibrant, successful community, you need a viable health care industry with good docs. And yet, 71 percent of the doctors in this State say they are considering early retirement; 50 percent of the physicians say they are having difficulty recruiting new doctors to practice in Arkansas.

It must be an unbelievably satisfying profession to bring life to be. And yet, in July of 2002, her insurance premiums more than doubled. See, the litigation culture made it nearly impossible for her to practice her love. I say nearly impossible, because she would not break her commitments to expecting patients and hung in there for a year.

We know something we did not know 20 years ago, when Hillary and I started working on public schools. We actually know how to turn failing schools around. We actually know what it means to say all children can learn. I was in a school in Harlem the other day where 2 years ago, 80 percent of the kids were doing reading and math below grade level. Two years later-2 years later- in one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City, 74 percent of the kids were doing reading and math at or above grade level-2 years. But the one thing America has never done, ever-and there was no real penalty to it before, but there is now-we have never taken what works in some places and been able to make it work everywhere for our schools. How are we going to do that? People used to make fun of Al Gore when he talked about global warming. We just got a study from one of the polar icecaps that indicates the 1990's were the warmest decade in a thousand years. I think we ought to have somebody in the White House that understands that. I personally think we ought to keep paying down the debt until we get out of debt for the first time since 1835, because that will keep interest rates lower, and our growth in this 8-year period has been more generated by private sector growth than any economic recovery in the 20th century. You can make your own list. But you think about the big things. That is what America ought to be focused on.

I do not know if anybody else will ever put the time in on this that I have or have the kind of personal, almost religious conviction I have about it. But keep in mind, this is an evolutionary process.

You are known as the tireless master of negotiating. How can both leaders resist the Clinton charm? I am afraid my charm and my reasoning abilities, at least for just 15 days, cannot compare with the thousands of years of history that go to the core of the identity of Israelis and Palestinians, as regards Jerusalem. We made a lot of progress. We got people to talk about it, to deal with it, to think about it. And I hope I prompted a lot of thinking about all the various options available to them. There is more than one way to resolve this in a way that is honorable for everyone. But I must tell you, when we started these negotiations, I did not think we had a one-in10 chance to succeed. I called this summit because I was afraid that the lack of progress was spinning out of control. The parties, after all, promised each other they would reach an agreement by the middle of September.

No, a higher percentage of all the people between 16 and 65, which is taken as the work force in-the potential work force; a higher percentage of those people are actually employed today, even with our continued, above-normal unemployment, than at any time in our previous history. And the truth is that for both women and for minorities, the percentage of decline in unemployment is greater for both women and minorities than it has been for the adult male-or white male. So, I think we have done those things. I am going to be referring to this young lady in a speech. She was on the air the other night; a story of-she did not come from Dixon, Illinois, but 90 miles away-Chicago, out of a ghetto. And she is the sole head and proprietor of this successful operation. And it is not the case that that person would get the breaks only because of tax breaks given to the rich or something like that? As a matter of fact, that again-that, too, is a distortion, that our tax program gave the breaks to the rich. Let me just draw a contrast with numbers so I will not have to try and convince you by rhetoric. John F. Kennedy had a tax reduction program somewhat similar to ours back in the early sixties. Some of his own party opposed him very much on this, but he went forward with it and said it will stimulate the economy. It will actually increase, eventually, revenues, more than decrease them. Now, 29 percent of his tax relief went to business; only 23 percent of ours did. And he gave greater cuts to the top five tax brackets than we did with ours; our greater percentage of ours is below the top brackets in this 25 percent across the board that we put in. But in addition to that, we put in some other things, like giving working mothers more tax credit or deduction for child care that they might have to provide; like giving the working wives-there is a tax penalty on them in the income tax. We reduced that very sizably. Now most two-earner families are two earners because they are at the lower end of the earning scale.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithloucannondavidhoffmanandjuanwilliamsthewashingtonpostforeignand", "title": "Interview With Lou Cannon, David Hoffman, and Juan Williams of the Washington Post on Foreign and Domestic Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lou-cannon-david-hoffman-and-juan-williams-the-washington-post-foreign-and", "publication_date": "16-01-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

This weekend is a good time to give thanks for our blessings and to resolve to do better in the coming year. One of our greatest blessings as Americans is that we live in a country with a growing economy, where people can pursue their dreams, turn ideas into enterprises, and provide for their families. It is a measure of our economy's resilience that even with high oil prices and softness in the housing market, we are still growing. In November, our economy added jobs for the 51st straight month, making this the longest period of uninterrupted job growth on record. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Yet it is more important to remember that behind all these numbers are real people. These people include the entrepreneurs who live their dreams by starting up new businesses. These people include small-business owners who create most of the new jobs in our economy. And most of all, these people include the tens of millions of working moms and dads whose jobs provide for their families. I know that even in this growing economy, some of you have real concerns. Some of you worry about your ability to afford health care coverage for your families. Some of you are concerned about meeting your monthly mortgage payments. Some of you worry about the impact of rising energy costs on fueling your cars and heating your homes. You expect your elected leaders in Washington to address these pressures on our economy and give you more options to help you deal with them. And I have put forth several proposals to do so. In the last month, Congress has responded to some of my initiatives. They passed a good energy bill, they passed a temporary patch to protect middle class families from the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and they passed a law that will help protect families from higher taxes when their lenders reduce their mortgage debt. Congress needs to do more to decrease America's dependence on oil. Congress needs to pass legislation that will help make health care coverage more affordable for small businesses and workers who buy their own policies. And Congress needs to act quickly on the rest of my proposals to help families struggling with rising mortgage payments keep their homes. Most of all, we need to set a good example in Washington by being careful with your money. I am disappointed that leaders in Congress sent me a massive spending bill that includes about 9,800 earmarks.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress407", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-407", "publication_date": "29-12-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

In those years Americans have taken more than 200,000 casualties in collective measures to suppress acts of aggression. All of us, working together, at different times and in different places, have made sure that aggression did not succeed. The chances for world security are larger, and the hope for world peace is nearer, because tonight aggression has not succeeded. Meanwhile, in lands and nations throughout the world much has been done to lift the standards of living. In Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, cooperation in economic and social progress is no longer just a matter of words.

At least they talk a great deal about their fear that the world is going to close in on them, but the other, you cannot deny that the Marxian theory and Lenin's theory and every Soviet leader since has at some time or other publicly reaffirmed his dedication to this and that is that Marxism, the theory, can only succeed when the entire world has become Communist. So is it a little naive, perhaps, to think that if we just reassure them, placate them, that they will moderate their They have got to, and maybe the failures of their own system, which make them dependent on the rest of us for help as they are maybe this will help them see the fallacy of this.

They believe that that religion of theirs, which is Marxist Leninism, requires them to support world revolution and bring about the oneworld Communist state. And they have never denied that. And we have to, you feel, have to contain that, have to stop that, not just in places like Poland but in Africa Yes, because I they have proven that their system is not of increased freedom. It is one of dictation. Can anyone say that the Tsar any more repressive on the Soviet people than this regime is? Did the aristocracy in the old days, did they have any different elevation of luxury over the peasantry than the hierarchy has over the average Soviet citizen, the so called masses, today? Beach homes on the Black Sea, private jets, helicopters, country homes outside, special stores where only they can purchase the certain special kind of goods they have created an aristocracy.

Remember, with that period of time, we said, Oh, let the inspections work. We were all for that. But it was clear that he was deceiving them.

What is it that you saw or you learned or you heard that made you start thinking about the culture of the drug trade and its impact on the inner cities, that compelled you then to want to tell these stories? Well, I was in Baltimore and it is a very drug saturated city, or it certainly was in the '80s when I arrived. and they actually tried to do that. And what became increasingly obvious to me over the years of covering it was that when you devote yourselves to street-level drug enforcement, when you try to win the drug war, you only have a limited number of resources, limited amount of resources. And I watched the police department in Baltimore, and then I noticed it in other cities - other cities with the same sort of problems of drug use, they stopped doing police work. They were arresting people for drugs, and that was presumptive police work but actually it was not . And at the same time that the numbers of drug arrests, and the incarcerations for drug arrests, went up, and they were small incarcerations, they were two, three months in jail because you could not put them anywhere, you could not build prisons fast enough. Meanwhile, the arrest rates for robbery, murder, were going down. And the one thing that makes cities safer is competent retroactive investigation of felonies. But to do that you have to used and not be used by informants, you have to know how to testify in court, you have to write a search warrant that is going to hold up. The good news is that some of the smarter police departments started to figure this out.  On the other hand, what we know is that a consequence of that was this massive trend towards incarceration, even of non-violent drug offenders. And I saw this even during the period that you were reporting and then starting to write for television. I saw this from the perspective of a state legislator, this, just, explosion of incarcerations, disproportionately African American and Latino.

You elected me to do what was right. And as long as I am President, that is exactly what I intend to do. This country is emerging from an incredibly difficult period in its history -- an era of irresponsibility that stretched from Wall Street to Washington, and had a devastating effect on a lot of people. We have started turning the corner on that era. hard work and self-reliance; responsibility for ourselves, but also responsibility for one another. It is about moving from an attitude that said What is in it for me? to one that asks, What is best for America? What is best for all our workers? What is best for all of our businesses? What is best for all of our children? Social Security and the minimum wage; the GI Bill and Medicare; civil rights and worker's rights and women's rights. But we also recognize that throughout our history, there has been a noble Republican vision as well, of what this country can be. It was the vision of Abraham Lincoln, who set up the first land grant colleges and launched the transcontinental railroad; the vision of Teddy Roosevelt, who used the power of government to break up monopolies; the vision of Dwight Eisenhower, who helped build the Interstate Highway System. And, yes, the vision of Ronald Reagan, who despite his aversion to government, was willing to help save Social Security for future generations -- working with Democrats. These were serious leaders for serious times. They were great politicians, but they did not spend all their time playing games or scoring points. They did not always prey on people's fears and anxieties. They made mistakes, but they did what they thought was in the best interests of their country and its people. And that is what the American people expect of us today -- Democrats, independents, and Republicans. That is the leadership we owe them. I know that folks are worried about the future.

Now the Democratic Party has always believed that the Government exists to help the people do the things they cannot get done by themselves. We want to give the people of this valley and all New England whatever help you yourselves desire in building up the resources of this great countryside. That is what we have done in other river basins, helping people make the most of their fine rivers. The Republican Party has exactly the opposite philosophy. They believe it is the purpose of Government to help special private interests exploit our national resources for their own private profit. If the Republicans take control in Washington, they will not help you with your navigation problems, or stream pollution, or power-for that might interfere with the enrichment of the manufacturers and the utilities who like things to stay as they are. Do not be fooled by scare stories that somebody in Washington wants to come up here and take this river away from you, or take control of it. They are just afraid you might stand up someday and take control of your resources yourselves. The truth is you can develop and control this river yourselves, and a Democratic government will cooperate with your local and State authorities to help you do it. Then you will really own the river, and be able to enjoy it the way you should, and make it work for you, in your interest, and not in the interests of private power. Now election day comes in November, as you know, on the 4th, and election day is the time when the people of the United States exercise the control of their Government. If you do not take an interest, if you do not get yourselves registered, if you do not go to the polls on the 4th of November, and you have bad government, you have nobody in the world to blame but yourselves.

It goes with energy--and I am concerned that recent tests have shown a steady decline in the standards of American fitness as compared with European and people around the world.

I think that physical fitness is a part of our survival, and I am hopeful that we can, through the White House--but really it is a private decision--but at least from this area we are going to try to do our best to emphasize this.

Nuclear missiles-these are the only weapons in the history of man that have not given birth, so far, to a defense against them, but this, as I say, would be the greatest thing for peace. If we could switch from a setup today in which peace is maintained on the basis that we can destroy each other, totally offensive weapons, each with a great arsenal and the threat that, well, if one starts, the other will retaliate. Does not it make much more sense if we could come up with a defensive system and then sit down with all the nuclear powers in the world and say, Look, let us get to less of an offensive nature and let us take up the idea of reassurance for ourselves on a basis of defensive systems, not offensive weapons ? And so, this is not a bargaining chip in that sense-of being willing to trade off the research and stop what we are doing in order to get x number of missiles eliminated; we will continue with that. Then, as I have said many times, I think if the research, and when the research, would show that such a weapon is practical, then, before deployment, I think we sit down together and decide how we use this to bring about the elimination of nuclear weapons, offensive weapons, and to make the world safer.

From the very first, we said that we could not hope for recovery until the last half of this year and we think in the last half we are going to see that recovery. How far is that recovery dependent on you breaking the budget stalemate? Do you think you will have that stalemate ended by the time you go to Europe? I think the money market is waiting to see if the Congress will-since we do not dominate or have the majority of both Houses-stay with its old-fashioned policies of artificial stimulation and quick fixes to cure things. All they ever did was temporarily reduce the fever, and then a couple of years later we had an even worse recession each time. But if the money markets see that Congress will do what it did last year and stay with us on our plan, making the further reductions that we are asking for in spending and stay with our tax program, I think that this will be the signal that will bring interest rates down. There have been scattered signs in the money market that they want them down also. Those signs are in various areas-our automobile industry, which is hard hit, and mainly because of the interest rates. Our people buy cars, as I am sure they do elsewhere, on the installment plan. They have to pay interest such as the mortgage on a house. This has hurt the automobile market. Here and there in the country, groups of local bankers have come together and put up sums of money specified for automobile loans at a rate of interest about 4 points below the market. As long as that money lasted, they would lend it at that lower interest rate for those who want to buy automobiles. The upsurge in automobile buying was instant. We have also seen some construction companies that evidently were able to liquidate their inventory of newly built houses by pulling down the interest rates themselves. We think that this indicates that the money market is ready and wants lower rates. But they have to be sure that we have inflation down for good-that it is not going to go zooming back up.

And if that is what we can bring out of these observances and the trip that has been planned, then I think everything we are doing is very worthwhile.

{"id": 772, "text": "As a new Congress convenes, we must take steps to speed up the economic recovery and to strengthen public confidence in the integrity of American corporations. This week in Chicago, I announced my growth-and-jobs plan, specific proposals to help workers, employers, and investors across America. For unemployed Americans whose benefits expired on December 28th, I asked Congress to act to extend those benefits. Congress did so quickly, and I signed the extension of unemployment benefits into law this week. For Americans who face the greatest difficulty finding work, I propose special reemployment accounts. These accounts will provide up to $3,000 to help pay for training, moving expenses, or other costs of finding a job. For all income-tax payers, I propose speeding up the tax cuts already approved by Congress, because Americans need that relief today. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty between now and 2009, we should do it now. Instead of waiting until 2008 to move more taxpayers from the 15-percent bracket to the 10-percent bracket, we should make that change now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000 by 2010, we should raise it now. When these changes are made, 92 million Americans will keep an average of $1,083 more of their own money. And for America's 84 million investors and those who will become investors, I propose eliminating the double taxation on stock dividends. Double taxation is unfair and bad for our economy. It falls especially hard on seniors, many of whom rely on dividends for a steady source of income in their retirement. Abolishing double taxation of dividends will leave nearly 35 million Americans with more of their own money to spend and invest, which will promote savings and return as much as $20 billion this year to the private economy. Overall, my tax cut proposals will add nearly $59 billion to the economy in 2003 alone. Our Government is also acting to restore investor confidence in the integrity and honesty of corporate America. In response to the abuses of some corporations, we passed serious reforms, and we will vigorously enforce them. Our Corporate Fraud Task Force has obtained convictions or guilty pleas in over 50 cases. More than 160 defendants have been charged with criminal or civil wrongdoing.

I had a conversation a couple of weeks back with a guy named Robert Putnam, who I have known for a long time. He was my professor actually at Harvard. I actually knew Bob when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in Bowling Alone, the weakening of the community fabric and the impact it is having on people. And the work he is doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like Galesburg, where 30 years ago, anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the Maytag plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it. The kids here all went to the same school -- the banker's kid and the guy working at the Maytag plant's going to the same school. They have got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They do not have to take out $100,000 of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as Americans. And that is what is been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis. And so I had to spend the first four years in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover. And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a Galesburg or a Clinton, Ohio, where Bob Putnam lived -- those trends have continued. And that is what people sense. I am doing okay right now, but what I have seen over the last 20 years and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just is not as secure, and that the work I am doing may not be rewarded.

I promised the citizens of Maine that night that we would try to follow that course if we were selected for this place of leadership.

Your Government--and I think it is very important that each of you always remembers this is your Government, not my Government-this is your Government and it has been infusing life into one right enterprise after another.

And my point to not only the Prime Minister of Japan but to the respective Presidents is that, look, I understand that there is great tension as a result of some events that took place in the past. But the United States and China-I mean, the United States and Japan at one time were sworn enemies. And now here we are sitting down as friends. In other words, it is possible to forget the past.

Housing prices went up for the first time in 3 years. You are not seeing the huge volatility or panic that you were seeing. And so all of that is a sign that we have stepped away from the precipice. As Ben Bernanke and others across the ideological spectrum have indicated, we were in a position where we could have gone into a great depression. But I suspect that the GDP numbers will still show that the economy contracted in the second quarter, that job loss is still a huge problem. And you do not have to read GDP numbers to see that, all you got to do is talk to the American people who are still losing jobs, losing homes, and worried about their ability to keep their health care and finance their child's college educations. So we are not going to rest until we have seen not just a technical improvement in GDP but until the American people's job prospects, their incomes have rebounded, and that is going to take some time. With respect to tonight, you know, I am, I have to say, fascinated with the fascination about this evening. As you know, this idea was prompted when I was talking to Sergeant Crowley, and he said, Well, maybe I will have a beer in the White House some day, and I said, Well, you know, I am sure that can be arranged. This is three folks having a drink at the end of the day and hopefully giving people an opportunity to listen to each other. It is an attempt to have some personal interaction when an issue has become so hyped and so symbolic that you lose sight of just the fact that these are people involved, including myself, all of whom are imperfect. And hopefully instead of ginning up anger and hyperbole, everybody can just spend a little bit of time with some self-reflection and recognizing that other people have different points of view.

Anyway, let me talk about the trip from my perspective, and we will kind of rotate around. Everybody will get at least one question; hopefully everybody will get two. First, I am looking forward to my trip. Obviously, one of the main purposes of the trip is to go speak about development, world development, in Monterrey. I will lay out there for the world leaders what- I already did so in our country-which is the Millennium Challenge Fund, of a fund that will ultimately be $5 billion a year. It starts at $1.5 billion, roughly $1.5 billion, and then will go up to about two-thirds of $5 billion, and then will be at $5 billion in year three and will remain at $5 billion. And that fund will be used to encourage-first of all, it will say our country assumes our rightful responsibility to help developing nations, but we expect there to be rightful obligations on those who receive them to make sure that there is an education system that works, a health care system that works, an opportunity for development of an entrepreneurial class or small businesses, foster trade between ourselves. And countries that practice good habits will get money. Now, this is on top of roughly $10 billion which we spend already in direct development aid, not including other projects, assistance to the World Bank organizations, et cetera. Also, I am really looking forward to seeing my friend the President of Mexico. He was my friend prior to September the 11th; he was my friend after September the 11th; he will be my friend for a long period of time because I know him well. I respect him a lot. We have got a very good relationship, and obviously, we have got a very important bilateral relationship. So we are going to have a-we will have a discussion about issues that are common issues. Obviously, the border is a common issue, how to make the border work better, looking at a variety of options as to how to modernize the border between Mexico and the United States, as well as the border between Canada and the United States.

We have said it is time to return to basics in education, and one of those basics is that you should be permitted to open your schoolday with a simple, silent, voluntary prayer. If Congress can open each day with a prayer, why cannot you? And you know, Congress probably needs it more than you do. We have said it is time to return to basics in reading the Constitution and to acknowledge that the Constitution does not prevent parents from receiving a tuition tax credit when they send their children to parochial schools. And in no way is it meant to deny the right to life. We have said it is time to return to basics in protecting America's neighborhoods. And that means among other things appointing judges who do not only respect the rights of criminals but also those of the victims of crime. And we have said it is time to return to the basics in protecting America itself. We have returned to the fundamental wisdom that the way to peace is not through American weakness but through American strength. Yes, we have had 8 great years. Have we done as much as we can do? You might as well ask Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham if after his spectacular game Monday night ask him if he is gone as far as he can go. Yes, I believe that the growth that our expansion has brought America can be just the beginning. America is entering a new age that will open opportunities for you and all young Americans, opportunities that we in the older generation could not even have dreamed of when we were your age. Let me tell you about something I heard the other day. It has to do with the technological revolution that is going on all around us and that many say has already surpassed the Industrial Revolution in changing the way humanity lives in the years ahead. The heart of this revolution is a tiny silicon chip that you can hold on the tip of your finger and still see most of the finger. Today that silicon chip has the incredible computing power of a million transistors; that is, of the biggest computers of the 1960's. Yet according to one of our nation's most prominent research directors, in less than 15 years, he says the power of a billion transistors will be packed on a chip.

This pursuit of justice and peace and the building of a new economic order must be undertaken in ways that promote constructive development rather than fruitless confrontation. Because India is both a developing country and also an industrial power, you are in a unique position to promote constructive international discussion about trade, energy, investment, balance of payments, technology, and other questions. I welcome your playing this worldwide leadership role. I know that there will be times when we will disagree on specific issues and even on general approaches to larger problems.

What I think is a mistake is I think it would be a mistake for the people who do not want to offend the NRA to blame Hollywood and the people that do not want to offend Hollywood to blame the NRA, instead of keeping our children and their safety and their future in mind and asking ourselves, what should we do about guns? What should we do about culture? What should we do about the schools? How can we help the parents? We should ask and answer all of them, not just one.

Or is it tough to put pressure on them, given the fact that they have been so supportive of you and so generous to your campaigns? No, it is easier for me to do, I think, in some ways, because I know them. Keep in mind, the first time I went out to Hollywood and did this in a highly public way was in late 1993. And then we got a lot of Hollywood executives in, and they played a major role in the development of the television rating systems, which was essential to make the V-chip work. So we got a lot of support out of the entertainment community for the rating systems and for the V-chip. We have gotten a remarkable amount of support in the years since from the high-tech community for control technologies on the Internet. So I think that they do not go as far as I wish they would often on the violent content of some movies and some television shows and some video games, but there has been progress made. One of the big problems we have got now is to make sure parents understand how to use the V-chip on television and understand how to use the blocking technologies on the Internet. Most parents are like me; they are not nearly as computer literate as their children are. And we have got a big job there to do.

No, I know that. I think that as the people we have been and still are a very migrant people. I think Americans move more than anyone else. And in many instances, it is the job holder; something happens and he starts exploring for work some place else and maybe goes and then sends for the family. But whatever means they have to use they do it. I cannot see any way that the Federal Government could set up a program for moving people, because then you get into the element of would there be something compulsory about it, would the government decide that somebody had to move.

Is it going to be possible, for example, to hold general revenue sharing at its present level? Is it going to be possible to hold the new block grants at their present funding level, or are all of those programs at this point still subject to further reductions in fiscal 1983?

We had some good discussions there at APEC, but this will be a chance to further our discussions and assure the Australian people that the American people are really grateful for the support and mutual efforts to make the world secure.

Basically, it was the idea that we would stop making false choices in Washington and try to unify our country. We could bring the deficit down and increase investment in education. We could be for a clean environment and for a growing economy. But you have got to be disciplined to do that. And he understands as well as anybody that the real appeal of our opponents in this election is, It is your money; let us just take it all now. And they want to talk about spending all this surplus right now. You may have won $10 million. If you went out and spent the 10 million, you should vote for Bush and Cheney. If not, you should vote for Gore and Lieberman. And what Dale said about the Vice President is absolutely right. But let me say, I think I know something about economic policy.

This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to the Ex-Im Bank separate from the December 11th end date for the CR? How do you feel about those and how do those affect the Democratic support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for this year is very appropriate. to get us past the October 1st beginning of a new fiscal year. So the end date in December is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for the next year. I do not think we should delay it any longer. If they do not think that they can be made within the next 10 days, then they should be made within the next couple of months.

Were you saying the President would not sign a waiver if it reached his desk, that he'd prefer it happen during the new administration? No, I think what I am saying is the short answer to your question is, no, I was not signaling an unwillingness on the part of the President to sign a bill containing such a waiver. I think the observation that I was making is that it seems odd that congressional Republicans would be choosing to sneak a provision in a budget bill to expedite the confirmation of somebody who is a decorated Marine Corps officer, somebody who has served Presidents in both parties, somebody who Democrats and Republicans have spoken warmly of. So I cannot really explain it. I am not indicating that the administration will refuse to cooperate with them.

{"id": 1326, "text": "This week we celebrated the creation of 4 million new jobs in America since I became President on a platform to renew the American dream by restoring our economy, empowering individual Americans to compete and win in it, making Government work for ordinary citizens, and rebuilding our communities. Since we started our national economic strategy, our private sector is creating jobs nearly 8 times faster than it was 4 years ago. It has not been easy to make these changes. We had to make some tough decisions to put our economic house in order. We had to break the bad habits that led to mismanagement of our economy and the explosion of our deficit for more than a decade. And we had to break through all of the partisan barriers and political rhetoric that too often keeps us from doing the right thing for the American people here in Washington, DC. Today I want to talk with you about two other historic decisions that call on us to break through partisan barriers and political rhetoric again. For very soon, Congress will vote on both health care reform and the crime bill, two issues crucial to our mission of renewing the American dream. I want to talk to you about two young Americans whose stories are the best arguments I have heard for why we have to fix what is wrong with our health care system and make our country safer again for all Americans. One of those young people is Amanda Stewart from Keyes, Oklahoma. This week, I gave awards to four young people who have done heroic deeds or performed remarkable public service. Amanda was one of them. She was injured in a car wreck in 1990 and paralyzed from the chest down. This wonderful young lady could have given up on life. Instead of becoming bitter or defeated, she is devoted herself to educating other young people not to drink and drive, not to ride with people who do, and to always use seat belts. She is helping others to avoid what happened to her. I met Amanda's family. Her father is a hardworking farmer in western Oklahoma. She has a lovely mother and a wonderful younger sister. She has not had any significant medical costs since just after her accident 4 years ago. The Stewarts have been paying $3,400 a year for a limited health insurance policy with a high deductible. But recently they were told that this month their insurance premiums were going to be raised to $9,600 a year. He is in a different party from me, and he made it clear to me that he does not want the National Government to give him anything.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress585", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-585", "publication_date": "06-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Bill Clinton"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1145, "text": "And then in this year's budget, I have asked them to fund some more research into smart gun technology, which would enable us to have guns that could only be fired by the adults who own them. One of the things that is being debated in Michigan is whether there should be parental accountability provisions. We had provisions in our law for that, so that all States would have these laws several do, but most do not and those were taken out, so maybe they will be revisited in the conference as well. But the main thing is, if we can just get the child trigger locks and fund investment in the smart gun technology, I think we will be a long way down the road. Of course, I think ultimately what we ought to do is license handgun owners the way we license people who drive cars. And I hope that we will consider that, as well. Now, this guy stole a gun, apparently that is the allegation in the house where the child took it. But it would clearly make a big difference in the future to people's lives. What about registering guns? All Americans are required to register their cars. You could do that, but the problem is there are over 200 million guns out there; some say 250 million guns out there now. And most of the experts with whom I talked before I made my proposal believe that if we required all handgun owners to be licensed, we could achieve the same results. That is, whether you have got an old gun or you are buying a new gun, if people could come in when they do get new guns and get a license, then I believe we'd have the same result. I am not sure, practically, that we could get all the guns registered in this country because there are so many out there already. So I'd like to begin with that. You know, keep in mind, we had all those kids die at Columbine, and when I fought for the Brady bill which has kept a half a million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting guns and the assault weapons ban, about somewhere between 8 and 12 Members of Congress were defeated in the next election by the NRA because they voted for that. And then when all those kids were killed at Columbine, I thought, surely, we can close the gun show loophole, have the child safety locks, and maybe have the parental responsibility provisions and ban ammunition clips.

I just would like to see, how do you see the role of King Abdallah in promoting the peace process and stability in the Middle East? And also, how do you evaluate the SaudiAmerican-comparing the terror in the region? First of all, I admire King Abdallah. I admire him because he is a man who commands a lot of respect from me personally and a lot of respect in the region. It is not to say that other people do not listen as well, but Saudi Arabia is geographically important, is the guardian of holy sites, and he is a well-respected man. And so in terms of the Middle Eastern peace process, the fact that he sent his Foreign Minister to Annapolis sent a very strong message that Middle Eastern peace is going to require the participation of more than just the United States and Israel and the Palestinians, that a true peace is going to require a commitment in the neighborhood of supporting two states living side by side in peace-two democratic states living side by side in peace. So he has laid out his own initiative in the past. It commanded great respect. It is a commitment to a process. And so I value him as-I view him as invaluable in the process. Secondly, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recognized that murderers threaten not only other parts of the world, but threaten the Kingdom's own security. And the security forces there have done a magnificent job of using intelligence to find the few that would murder the many. I have been impressed-and any objective observer would be impressed-by Saudi Arabia's commitment to finding those people that use murder as a weapon. And so I-to answer your question, I am satisfied with our cooperation. I am appreciative of the efforts that the intelligence community inside Saudi has been making to deal with these extremists, some of whom conduct murder in-within the Kingdom, some of whom leave the Kingdom to conduct murder. And the King is fully aware that this is a-such a presence is a threat to his own internal securities, as well as recognizing an obligation to prevent those from going outside the country to murder.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media", "publication_date": "04-01-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 1179, "text": "What a moment of hope it was 1 year ago when Central American leaders concluded their meeting in Guatemala. The Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, a Communist regime fighting a civil war against 15,000 Nicaraguan freedom fighters opposed to their oppression, agreed to a series of sweeping democratic reforms. If carried out, those reforms would have ended the killing and brought peace to Nicaragua and Central America. It would also have meant that Nicaragua would at last join the family of free, democratic nations. To much media fanfare, the opposition newspaper in Nicaragua, La Prensa, was reopened. A few political prisoners were released, and political groups were allowed more latitude. Most important, Sandinistas finally agreed to the freedom fighters' request for direct negotiations for a peaceful, democratic settlement. Now the main reason the Sandinistas agreed to those steps a year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters, including important battlefield victories like the one at Los Minas. But tragically, at the very moment when continued strength and determination by the United States might have meant the continued success of the peace plan, the United States House of Representatives decided, and by only a very narrow margin, to refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters. This, of course, removed the principal prod-the military victories and popular success of the freedom fighters-to Sandinista participation in the peace plan and sent an immediate signal of American weakness to the Communists. This failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and sad consequences-just how costly and sad we have seen during the past few weeks. Communist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega has been visiting Castro in Cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who has brought so much sadness and misery to that country while in Nicaragua , a renewed attack on political dissent is being led by the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated Communist and grim, hardened repressor of human rights whose office, according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also been actively engaged in the international drug trade. Acting under the orders of the Communist leaders and Borge's supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans. Opposition leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison. The Communists ordered the Catholic archbishop to shut down the Catholic radio station, and for almost 2 weeks the independent newspaper, La Prensa, was refused permission to publish.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationaidthenicaraguandemocraticresistance", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on Aid to the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-aid-the-nicaraguan-democratic-resistance", "publication_date": "30-07-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The most important challenge facing that Congress will be joining with us in keeping a growing America on the road to a brighter future, the road that you and I and all Americans started on just 6 years ago. through the ingenuity, energy, and determination of the American people. Together we set out to cut your taxes and cut the growth of government spending so that you could get on with the important work of building a better future for yourself, your family, and all America. We first cut tax rates with our 1981 tax cut. Since the lower tax rates in that bill took effect, America has created over 12 million new jobs. We have had 48 straight months of economic growth and one of the longest periods of uninterrupted growth in the last 50 years. And after a decade-long decline, the American family's real income has been rising again and rising faster. But that is just the beginning; because earlier this year, with your help, Congress pushed aside the special interests and the tax-and-spend crowd, rolled up its sleeves, and shaped the tools that will help you and all Americans build on that record. That is when Congress passed the new tax reform bill, which will cut the top tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and for 8 out of 10 Americans will mean a top rate of no more than 15 percent. For the 4 years since our first tax cut found its footing, the American economy has been climbing to the mountaintop. With tax reform, America is going to shoot for the stars. That is why I was disappointed this week to hear some talk from the new Congress that we should stop the climb, turn around, and start back in the direction we have come from. Even before they take their oath of office, some in the new Congress are talking about breaking faith with the American people and taking back part of tax reform before it has taken effect. Yes, they say that to reduce the deficit they want to keep some people's tax rates high.

The Soviet Union, we understand, does have a surplus of oil. We have a surplus of grain. So, at least we ought, in a very preliminary way, just discuss any alternatives, but we have not gone beyond that. Has any kind of barter arrangement--if the Soviet Union cannot supply the oil in exchange for grain, are you hoping that they will exert their influence over the Arabs who listen to them? I think there is a better way to exercise our influence with the Arab nations, and that is through the International Energy Agency, which was set up or promoted primarily by the United States about a year ago, where the basic industrial consuming nations have joined together to meet with the producing nations, OPEC, for example. We are negotiating directly with them. I think that has more potential than relying on the Soviet Union to help us with the Arab nations. Our relations with the Arab nations are good.

But when you look at the way events are going there, is it inevitable in your opinion? And I would say it is a matter for the determination of the German people.

If you combine those things together, then we can not only reduce our deficit, but we can continue to invest in things like education and research and development that are going to help us grow. So I am not hearing you say, read my lips, no new taxes. You think there is going to have to be additional revenue over the next four years. There is no doubt we need additional revenue coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit. And we can do it in a gradual way so it does not have a huge impact. And as I said, when you look at some of these deductions that certain folks are able to take advantage of, the average person cannot take advantage of. The average person does not have access to Cayman Island accounts. The average person does not have access to carried interest income where they end up paying a much lower rate on billions of dollars that they are earned. And so we just want to make sure that the whole system is fair, that it is transparent and that we are reducing our deficit in a way that does not hamper growth, reduce the kinds of, you know, strategies that we need in order to make sure that we are creating good jobs and a strong middle class. American women have fought in many of our wars. Some of them have been killed and wounded in our wars. Right. Do you have any hesitation, as commander in chief, ordering women into combat? And the reason is become -- because women, as a practical matter, are now in combat. They may not get treated as if they are in combat, but when they are in theater in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, they are vulnerable, they are wounded, and they have been killed.

This is why I had Gulf countries up to Camp David to start coordinating more effectively to interdict arms shipments, to improve intelligence sharing, to support coordination of ballistic missile defense systems. And as soon as this debate is over, we will, I think, be able to invigorate what has been an ongoing conversation with the Israelis about how we can do even more to enhance the unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation that we have with them, and to see, are there additional capabilities that Israel may be able to use to prevent Hezbollah, for example, from getting missiles. But I guess the point is that where Iran has been effective in its destabilizing activities, it is not because it is had a lot of money. It is because they have effectively used proxies; it is because they have invested in places like Lebanon for decades and become entrenched. And the reason we have not done a better job of stopping that is not because they are outspending us. The reason is, is because we have not been as coordinated, had as good intelligence and been as systematic in pushing back as we need to be. So the second big issue, it seems to me, is this question of what happens in 10 or 15 years. I am sorry, before there is one other point, just for context and if you want, you can splice it into the previous answer the sanctions were so effective that even with the $50 billion But you have used the figure, $150 billion. Well, no , the initial estimates ranged from $100 billion to $150 billion. The analysis once a full overview of the money they had frozen overseas and what was already committed to various payments and what was not brought that analysis down to about $56 billion. They will be getting access to that once they have done all the things they need to do to shut off the various pathways to a possible nuclear weapon that are called for in the deal. But the point I was going to make was that the sanctions have been so effective that even with that $56 billion, even with their economy potentially improving modestly as they see sanctions suspended, it is going to take, we estimate, till 2022 for their economy to get back to where it was, where it would have been had sanctions not been imposed.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjaneeisnerforward", "title": "Interview with Jane Eisner of FORWARD", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jane-eisner-forward", "publication_date": "28-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I had never met Chevy Chase in my entire life, except on a movie screen. And in 1988 or '89, I went up to Long Island in the summertime. Hillary and I were up there visiting our friend Liz Robins, who is here tonight. And they asked me if I would be an umpire in this game. And once I realized there were some members of the press there and I'd be able to give them grades instead of the other way around, I eagerly accepted. Now, at that time a lot of you will not remember this; I hope, at least, you will not remember it, and I hope you will forget after I tell you tonight. I had given a speech for Governor Dukakis at the Democratic Convention, which I intend to complete here this evening. Anyway I cannot believe I said that. The announcer for the ball game was Jim Brady, the guy that does that Brady's Bits in Parade magazine every Sunday, you know? He is a delightful man, but when he saw me out there on the mound about ready to call balls and strikes, he saidhe introduced mehe said, This is Governor ENTITY from Arkansas. He is up here visiting, and if he takes as long to make the calls today as he did to speak in Atlanta, we will never get out of here. I really appreciated that. Anyway, so the game starts, and the next time the sides change, I look up in the stands, and this tall guy stands up and walks down, comes out to the pitcher's mound, shakes my hand, and says, I am Chevy Chase. And he said, I may be the only person in America besides your mother who feels this way, but I liked that speech. That is verbatim what he said.

We are in constant communication. A lot of viewers are hearing about the fiscal cliff but may not know what exactly does this mean. Look, if we do not do anything, if Congress does nothing, then on Jan. 1 taxes on every family in America goes up. For the typical, middle class family, that means $2,200 out of pocket. That is $2,200 that could be spent on groceries, a mortgage, sending a kid to college. It means $200 billion dollars come out of our economy that suddenly businesses are not seeing, and as a consequence, they may slow down in terms of their investment and their hiring. So it would be bad for the economy, bad for American families. The good news is, that there is a pretty simple solution to that part of it. The Democrats and Republicans both say that they do not want taxes on middle class families to go up. So we could go ahead and pass a bill, extending middle class tax cuts for all income $250,000 or below - that means 98 percent of Americans would not see their taxes go up a single dime, that means 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up and that takes a lot of the edge off the fiscal cliff. The Senate's already passed that bill, Democrats in the house are ready to pass that bill, the only holdouts right now are House Republicans. Obviously I am ready to sign that bill. The other thing that the fiscal cliff involves are our long-term debt and deficits and what I said on the campaign, remains true. I have already cut a trillion dollars in spending; I am willing to do a lot more cuts in spending. We also need to pair it up with a little more revenue. For people in the top 2 percent income brackets, who want to go back to the Clinton rates and pay slightly higher taxes, you couple $2 of spending cuts for every $1 of revenue and you can solve the deficit problem as well, which would obviously give us a lot of certainty going forward and allow the economy to gain some steam.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfrankvascellarocbswccpminnesota", "title": "Interview with Frank Vascellaro of CBS WCCP, Minnesota", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-frank-vascellaro-cbs-wccp-minnesota", "publication_date": "13-12-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

ENTITY, we heard you urging people to get out and vote next Tuesday when you were at Cobo Center this afternoon. Does that low voter turnout of course it concerns you, but what can be done to change that, and more importantly to change the image of politicians? Well, if you looked at the '92 campaign, you see what can be done. If you have a vigorous debate on the issues and if you have a real hopeful campaign, if you are trying to build up not tear down, then people come out and vote. If these campaigns are totally dominated by the negative, not the positive, and by people trying to tear down, not build up, then a lot of voters just stay home. They turn it off. And then the election tends to go to the person with the most extremist support, which is why a lot of these extreme Republicans have worked so hard on their negative campaigns and to raise so much money. They want to drive down voter turnout, diminish confidence in the political process, and give the election to the extremist element in their own party. But I have to tell you, I think in the last couple of weeks, Americans are getting more realistic and more hopeful about their country again. They see that we are improving the economy, that we are making this Government work for ordinary people. We have got a smaller Government and a smaller deficit but a more active approach to facing the problems of this country. They see other people in other parts of the world, from the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, to Korea, to Haiti, to Northern Ireland, looking to us for energy and support. And I think they are feeling better about themselves and their country. And if that happens, we will have a higher voter turnout. We know you are getting ready to leave Detroit now for Ohio, ENTITY.

Now, let me ask you something. This is stuff I love, this rumor that Joe Biden and Hilary might swap, and she might run for Vice President and he might is there You know, Joe Biden is not only a great Vice President, but he has been a great advisor and a great friend to me So I think that they are doing great where they are, and both of them are racking up a lot of miles.

Just imagine if all remote health clinics were connected electronically to major medical centers. Imagine if Dine could commute to high-tech, high-paying jobs in large cities just by getting on a computer here in Shiprock.

It presents recommendations on what we must do to help prevent such a tragedy from occurring again. And I look forward to reading and reviewing it in thorough detail. And let me give my heartfelt thanks to the members and staff of the Rogers commission. They have performed their task with distinction, and it was an arduous one. To a nation still suffering from the trauma of the loss of the Challenger and her brave crew, it was often a painful duty. Their investigation was thorough and comprehensive and completed within the mandated time. They went in with their eyes wide open and were unflinching in pursuit of the facts. Though saddened and chastened, our nation will be stronger because of their courage and dedication. And as we push forward in our conquest of space and push forward we will our shuttle program will be safer and better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. I want to thank the Congress for letting the Commission proceed unfettered with its investigation, and also the staff of NASA, the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, and others, whose cooperation made the Commission's report possible. And today we see once again that our true faith as a nation lies in our free and open society. In America we learn from our setbacks as well as our successes. And although the lessons of failure are hard, they are often the most important on the road to progress. We have learned in these past few months that we are frail and fallible, but we have also learned that we have the courage to face our faults and the strength to correct our errors. Because we do not hide our mistakes, we are not condemned to repeat them. Because we are an open society, we have room to grow. We can count on their courage to pull us through the hard places I am speaking now of the American people, because we base our trust on the American people. And that is why we can look to their wisdom, creativity, to show us the way to the future. This has been a difficult passage for America, but we will go on just as the crew of the space shuttle Challenger would have wanted us to. We will use every ounce of American skill, ingenuity, and gumption; and we will work twice as hard and be twice as vigilant.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksreceivingthefinalreportthepresidentialcommissionthespaceshuttle", "title": "Remarks on Receiving the Final Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-receiving-the-final-report-the-presidential-commission-the-space-shuttle", "publication_date": "09-06-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We are talking about fewer than 300 people who are being searched for in an area at least the size of West Virginia, portions of which are very densely forested, as I understand it. And, again, this is a population of kidnapped girls that we hope remains intact and together, but obviously if they have been separated that makes the challenge even greater -- which does not mean that we will not provide all the assistance and assets that we can in that effort in helping Nigeria conduct this search, but it is certainly a challenge. But the security situation is apparently so bad that the President of the country cancelled a visit to the area today. I think the fact that the security situation, because of Boko Haram, is real is one that is self-evident and which I discussed moments ago. But that does not mean that we cannot and that they cannot conduct a search, and that is certainly what is happening. We have already, as I discussed earlier this week, launched both manned and unmanned aircraft as part of the reconnaissance effort, and we have a team of personnel assisting the Nigerian government in a variety of ways. Other nations have lent their support to the effort and we hope that it will bear fruit and we will find the girls.

I think the Emperor and Empress, on their recent trip here, were deeply moved by the friendship and the intensity of the friendship for them and for the Japanese people that were demonstrated by the Americans. So I think the feeling in this country about Japan is as strong and as positive as it has ever been. And you know, you are going through a period of political change. You have to work that out. That is what democracies do from time to time. And so, as that-the whole yen-dollar relationship may be in part a product of the perception that maybe things will not change quickly enough because of political conditions.

I think that that depends upon whether such decisions would be made really voluntarily and by will of a majority of the people. That is, I sense, particularly-and I have been to Belarus, so I have a feeling for that. I have also been to Ukraine, but I have not spent as much time.

Yesterday, Secretary of Agriculture Bergland announced that a payments program, very similar to the one declared illegal by the Comptroller General, was going to be proposed. Why are you insisting on Government subsidies rather than tariffs or import restrictions to support the price of sugar? I think that a 13 1/2-cent sugar price is about the minimum that would be advisable, both for domestic producers and also for imported sugar. We have supported the new farm bill which provides price supports until the international sugar agreement can be implemented. I did this reluctantly, as you may know. We did not support the de la Garza amendment in its original form and-accepted it only if the conferees would agree that the price support mechanism would be terminated at the time an international sugar agreement was reached, if the international sugar agreement encompassed a price of about 13 1/2 cents.

But, certainly, we continue to be focused on these issues. Last Friday, a federal judge appointed by President Obama issued an injunction on a separate immigration executive action, specifically stopping the detention of migrants coming across the border in Texas. Is the Department of Justice going to seek a stay of this injunction in the same way they are seeking a stay -- I'd encourage you to check with DOJ about sort of the next step in that legal process. I do know that the issue in question in that legal proceeding was related to our efforts to address what at the time was a rather urgent situation that we saw a substantial number of unaccompanied minors at the southern border attempting to illegally enter the United States of America. And one of our efforts to try to respond to that situation was to detain recent border-crossers near the border, and to try to find an environment in which families could be detained together, and to try to make sure that we are doing that in the most humane way possible. So I know that there are some who raised concerns about that policy, but that is what the administration believed was an appropriate way to respond to that urgent situation. Since that time, we have seen the numbers of undocumented immigrants, particularly unaccompanied minors, in that sector of the border decline substantially. And that is thanks to the comprehensive strategy that this administration has put in place, working with Central American countries, working with our partners in Mexico, and stepping up some of our law enforcement capabilities on the border to try to address the situation. And that situation has -- or at least the urgency of the situation down there has subsided dramatically. your administration argued that this detention served as a deterrent to make sure that was not another ongoing flood of migrants.

He felt as if he was being further and further surrounded by NATO members, folks who are looking west economically, from a security perspective. And even in Ukraine, the crown jewel of the former Soviet system, outside of Russia, a oligarchy that was corrupt was rejected by people on the streets. And so what you saw was a scrambling, a reaction to people in the Ukraine saying, we want a different way of life. The fact that Crimea, which historically is dominated by native Russians and Russian speakers, was annexed illegally does not in any way negate the fact that the way of life, the systems of economic organization, the notions of rule of law, those values that we hold dear, are ascendant, and you know, the other side is going to be on the defense.

The enemy who attacked us despises freedom and harbors resentment at the slights he believes America and the Western nations have inflicted on his people. He fights to establish his rule over an entire region. And over time, he turns to a strategy of suicide attacks destined to create so much carnage that the American people will tire of the violence and give up the fight.

The enemy I have just described is not Al Qaida, and the attack is not 9/11, and the empire is not the radical caliphate envisioned by Usama bin Laden. Instead, what I have described is the war machine of Imperial Japan in the 1940s, its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and its attempt to impose its empire throughout East Asia. Ultimately, the United States prevailed in World War II, and we have fought two more land wars in Asia. And many in this hall were veterans of those campaigns. Yet even the most optimistic among you probably would not have foreseen that the Japanese would transform themselves into one of America's strongest and most steadfast allies, or that the South Koreans would recover from enemy invasion to raise up one of the world's most powerful economies, or that Asia would pull itself out of poverty and hopelessness as it embraced markets and freedom.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheveteransforeignwarsnationalconventionkansascitymissouri", "title": "Remarks at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-veterans-foreign-wars-national-convention-kansas-city-missouri", "publication_date": "22-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

In the talks on strategic arms limitations, the SALT talks, we advanced a comprehensive proposal for genuine reductions, limitations, and a freeze on new technology which would maintain balanced strategic strength. We have urged a complete end to all nuclear tests, and these negotiations are now underway. Agreement here could be a milestone in U.S.-Soviet relations. We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked France, Britain, and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives. We have undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We have encouraged the Soviets to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere. We have begun regular consultations with the Soviet leaders as cochairmen of the prospective Geneva conference to promote peace in the Middle East. We and our allies are negotiating together with the Soviet Union and their allies in the Warsaw Pact nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe. We have renewed the 1972 agreement for cooperation in science and technology, and a similar agreement for cooperation in outer space. We are seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger. In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on Vladivostok accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists.

Otherwise, I think a reservation which would require us to re-negotiate the treaty with nearly a hundred countries, in my opinion it would be better to defeat the treaty.

They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of Viet-Nam, against the Communists. We are prepared to continue to assist them, but I do not think that the war can be won unless the people support the effort and, in my opinion, in the last 2 months, the government has gotten out of touch with the people. The repressions against the Buddhists, we felt, were very unwise. It is my hope that this will become increasingly obvious to the government, that they will take steps to try to bring back popular support for this very essential struggle. Do you think this government still has time to regain the support of the people? With changes in policy and perhaps with personnel I think it can. If it does not make those changes, I would think that the chances of winning it would not be very good. Has not every indication from Saigon been that President Diem has no intention of changing his pattern? If he does not change it, of course, that is his decision. He has been there 10 years and, as I say, he has carried this burden when he has been counted out on a number of occasions. Our best judgment is that he cannot be successful on this basis. We hope that he comes to see that, but in the final analysis it is the people and the government itself who have to win or lose this struggle.

{"id": 1316, "text": "Airlines have agreed to make more staff available to expedite check-in and boarding, to set aside extra seats and even extra planes to help accommodate passengers affected by cancellations and delays. They agreed to bring in additional ticket kiosks and baggage handling gear as well as rolling staircases. Fourth, the Federal Government is using the Internet to provide real-time updates on flight delays. People in America have got to know there is a web site called fly.faa.gov; that is where the FAA transmits information on airport backups directly to passengers and their families. If you are interested in making sure that your plans can-are not going to be disrupted, you can get on the web site of fly.faa.gov. As well, if you want to, you can sign up to receive delay notices on your mobile phones. In other words, part of making sure people are not inconvenienced is there to be good transmission of sound, real-time information. Fifth, we are proposing new regulations to help ensure that airline passengers are treated fairly. We are proposing to double the amount of compensation passengers receive when they are forced off overbooked flights. For example, a passenger forced to wait more than 2 hours for another flight would receive a minimum of $800 under our idea, instead of the current $400. We want people who are responsible for moving passengers to understand that there will be consequences for these delays, all aiming to get the system to work better. We are proposing a requirement that airlines collect better data on flight delays and provide that data to the Department of Transportation. We are evaluating a number of other recommendations for the airlines, including mandatory contingency plans to aid stranded passengers and penalties for chronically delayed flights. Finally, the Department of Transportation and the FAA are working on innovative ways to reduce congestion in the long run. While short-term improvements in flight operations and passenger treatment can help, they do not cure the underlying problem. In certain parts of our country, the demand for air service exceeds the available supply. As a result, airlines are scheduling more arrivals and departures than airports can possibly handle, and passengers are paying the price in backups and delays. The key to solving this problem is managing the demand for flights at overloaded airports, and there are a variety of tools to do this in a fair and efficient way. For example, fees could be higher at peak hours and at crowded airports, or takeoff and landing rights could be auctioned to the highest value flights.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithsecretarytransportationmaryepetersandfederalaviation", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Secretary of Transportation Mary E.

Why are we better off with a breakout time entirely shrunk in six months or nine months, where we have no inspectors on the ground, we have less insight into their program, we have shattered international unity, because the perception now is that the United States, having painstakingly arrived at an agreement and mobilized the entire world community behind it, has seen its Congress rejected?

If they are serious about delivering a Palestinian state, then they should renounce violence, accept the framework provided by the previous agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalistscairo", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists in Cairo", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-cairo", "publication_date": "04-06-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

But I did not especially on issues affecting America's future, I never let the polls control me. It passed by one vote, and I knew it was the right thing to do. The decision to help Mexico was opposed 81-15. And let me give you some other things. By contrast, if you took polls in the beginning, it would appear that the public overwhelmingly agreed with me on all the gun safety issues, but there is no question that one of the reasons we lost seats in the Congress in '94 was because of the efforts of the NRA. If you took polls on the health care issue in '94, they all looked to be popular, but it turned out not to be. And the reason for that is but I was not unaware of that; I knew that you have to understand how to read polls. I mean, you could be on a popular issue, but if the people who are against you are more intense than the people who are for you, it will still be a net loss at voting time.

Some might say this gathering is a microcosm of the problems that the world faces but to me this gathering is a sample of the opportunities we have to communicate on a personal level and to cooperate as representatives of our independent nations. This room is occupied by men and women aware of their responsibilities and respectful of the obligations of others.

George Santayana, an American traveler and philosopher, once said, A man's feet must be planted in his country, but his eyes should survey the world. Well, this is the vision required of each of us and of every world leader. We must uncompromisingly represent the interests of our countries, yet be ever mindful that by our actions, we are determining the future of mankind. In the conduct of your duties, be diligent; in the search for peace, be bold. The people of the world owe a special debt of gratitude to diplomats and their families, who today must cope not only with the frustrations inherent with the profession, but also with personal danger. In the last 15 years, diplomats from over a hundred countries have been victims of terrorist attacks. Fortunately, most have survived those attacks; a few, tragically, have not. Those who perpetrate these dastardly acts should never doubt that every nation considers an attack on any diplomat as a crime against mankind which will not be tolerated in any land.

In my first two years, I was not relying on executive powers, because I had big majorities in the Congress and we were able to get bills done, get bills passed. And even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we have got - a classic example being immigration reform, where I held off for years in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution - one that, by the way, did pass through the Senate on a bipartisan basis with our help. I was very proud of that. I went out of my way to make sure our help was behind the scenes so that Republicans did not feel as if it was going to hurt them politically. At the end of the day, John Boehner and the House Republicans could not pull the trigger on getting it done. And it was only then, after we had exhausted efforts for bipartisan reform that we took some additional steps on immigration executive actions. So my suggestion to the president-elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it is harder to undo. And that does not mean, though, that he is not going to come in and look at the various agencies and see the rules we have passed and if he wants to reverse some of those rules, that is part of the democratic process. That is , you know, why I tell people to vote because it turns out elections mean something. And this election means even more because the presidency, as has been widely noted, is so powerful. It is grown more powerful over generations. You used your power in certain ways, and even in ways that you'd suggested in the past might be beyond your authority. Well, no, I do not think I have done that. If I am thinking of immigration, for example. Well, what I said with immigration reform was that I could not simply sign a document that legalized 11 million people who had come here illegally and were currently undocumented.

That stuff did not steep into me. You know, my mother and my grandparents who did raise me, fortified me. Yeah. was they never portrayed a negative picture of him. They actually accentuated what was good about him rather than bad. And you had to do your own homework. I had to do my own homework but the point is though is that I did not end up... And I did not internalize a bunch of negative attitudes about who he was and thereby did not think that that was who I had to be.

I looked around that table at the leaders of some of the world's great democracies, and I could not help thinking how precious our common heritage is. It was a great Italian who said, the natural rights of personality, family, and society exist before the state. Those words, spoken by an Italian, are as American as the Declaration of Independence-for that matter, as British as the Common Law and as French as the writings of Montesquieu. They could be called the common credo of every democratic nation across the Earth. Yet if freedom, democracy, and the rights of man are to be preserved through the ages, free men and women must accept the responsibilities that go with their freedoms. And this is why I wanted to take some time out after the summit to meet with you, because as business men and women, as citizens, you have been leaders in taking up the responsibilities of liberty. Again and again, over the years, all of you have volunteered yourselves and your corporations to causes that have helped make life better for the people of both Italy and America and of people all over the world. When you have seen a need to be filled, a job to be done, you have not waited for government to lead the way; you have set out and got the work done yourselves. And let me say that we can see all around us testimony to the strength here in Italy of voluntarism and of private giving, of what we in America sometimes call private sector initiatives. It was a private sector initiative by Fiat that restored this magnificent building, the Palazzo Grassi. And just down the Grand Canal are the noble horses of St. Mark's Basilica, which through an initiative by Olivetti have toured the world, showing something of the beauty of Venice to many who will not have the opportunity to come to this great city. Yes, in country after country, private sector initiatives are teaching children, caring for the sick, helping the poor build better lives for themselves, and searching for ways to cure disease. Whether people are in sickness, sorrow, or in need, private sector initiatives have been created to answer the call. Last November in Paris, at the International Conference on Private Sector Initiatives, men and women from seven nations showed that yours is an international movement.

But you know, I had to take that very important trip to the Middle East, and when I came back, a lot of our candidates asked me to get out there and campaign, including Governor Cuomo, so I tried to do all I could to make the best argument for why we are moving our country in the right direction and we do not want to go back to the policies that failed us before in the eighties. So this morning I am just taking a last opportunity to encourage the American people to go out and vote, to make their voices heard today. The stakes in this election are quite high, as they always are in any midterm election, but especially in this one. So I hope the people within the sound of my voice will exercise their citizenship today and get out there and vote. Interesting contrast for you; maybe you can talk about it for just a second, between the events of the Middle East and our political system and the fact that the peace treaty signing coming so close to our election. Well, of course, we have been working on that very hard for a couple of years. It is just a coincidence that it came as close as it did to our election. But I would hope that it would remind the American people of the great potential of this country and the greatness of this country. And I hope it would keep our people in a positive frame of mind. One of the unfortunate aspects of so much of modern campaigning is that the negative tends to outweigh the positive, and the negative television ads, the whole business about the tone and tenor of our elections. This is actually quite a great country with a great past and an even greater future if the people who are going to be affected by it will invest in it and vote for it and vote for people who will build the country, not just place blame, vote for people who will keep moving us into the future. That is really the lesson of the Middle East, that people want the United States involved in the peacemaking and the problem solving of the world, whether in the Middle East or in Haiti or Northern Ireland, just to name three, because they think we have a good system and that we are a good people.

But I do have some ideas about those things that I will be discussing with the other leaders. ENTITY, let me start my question with your view on Japan. Since you took office you have mentioned Japan several times. At times you were somewhat stem, expressing its remoteness from an open market. At times you were generous for expressing the relationship of the most important bilateral one for the United States. Which of your assessments is true to your feeling? First of all, I probably have more admiration for your country in more ways than any ENTITY who has ever served. I have had the privilege of traveling to Japan many times. I actively sought Japanese companies to come to my State when I was a Governor. I believe you have a very great country with an even brighter future than your past. I think that our relationship is based on our ability to stand up for our common security interests, to promote the values of democracy and free markets, and to have a reasonable trade relationship. I think that there are things that we need to do in our trade relationship that will benefit both of us. I do not want to create American jobs at the expense of Japanese jobs. I think that changing the nature of the trading relationship is in the interest of both countries, and I do not think it is fair for an ENTITY to ask another country to do something that is good for America but bad for the other country. If I did not think it was good for both of us, I would not push that. But I think we will work that out. And the main thing I want to say to the people of Japan is that this period of political turmoil is not a bad thing for Japan. I know it is different from what you have experienced in the last few decades, but Japan has had an astonishing amount of success with the certain political arrangement. But as the global economy changes, as the people of Japan themselves change in their aspirations, the political system will have to alter to reflect that. And the people of Japan should be, I think, very hopeful about their future.

And now you are talking about pen and phone and executive orders and executive actions. Do you think you were naive back then or have you recalibrated your expectations and your ambitions? Well, part of it is we got a lot of that stuff done. We have got in this country a health care reform that has already signed up millions of people and makes sure that everybody who is watching, anybody who already has insurance will not be dropped because of a preexisting condition. And if they do not have health insurance, they can get it on HealthCare.gov. We have made enormous strides on the education front, changing our student loan programs so that millions more young people get student loans. And so part of what is happened is that checklist that I had when I came into office, we have passed a lot of that and we are implementing a lot of it. And so in no way are my expectations diminished or my ambitions diminished, but what is obviously true is we have got divided government right now. The House Republicans in particular have had difficulty rallying around any agenda, much less mine. And in that kind of environment, what I do not want is the American people to think that the only way for us to make big change is through legislation. We have all got to work together to continue to provide opportunity for the next generation. And let us talk about House Republicans and Senate Republicans because there has been a large contingency of Republicans critical of your new approach. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who might run for president, calls this the imperial presidency. And in the House, there is this thing, as you know, called the Stop Act. They want to rein in what you are trying to do. How do you respond to that? The truth of the matter is, is that every president engages in executive actions. In fact, we have been very disciplined and sparing in terms of the executive actions that we have taken. We make sure that we are doing it within the authority that we have under statute.

There will be no political third rail when it comes to Social Security. Now is the time for good people of good will to come together and get the problem fixed. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that a consumption tax, maybe even a national sales tax, might spur greater economic growth. What do you think about that? I think that I am going to wait until the tax commission I put together, the reform commission headed by former Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, former Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, comes forward with some ideas. I told the American people I want to work to simplify the Tax Code and make it easier to understand, so people are spending less time filing paper, and I believe a simplified Tax Code will spur entrepreneurial activity. And so I am looking forward to what the commission has to say.

In other words, the executive vice presidents, the operating officers, the people responsible for certain aspects of the organization have been brought to justice- a lot of them have been.

So we each year have identified billions of dollars in cuts and wasteful spending. And you know, as I said before, part of what we have to recognize is that over the last two years we had a brutal recession and a critical crisis that had to be addressed. And that did increase the deficit. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that we would have seen hundreds of thousands of teachers laid off, hundreds of thousands of firefighters and police officers laid off. This is not just at the federal level. It is also at the state level. We had to help them because their budgets were getting decimated by the severity of this recession. But having said that that, you know, that was a crisis moment that had to be addressed, what people are actually right about is that we have got to make sure that, moving forward, we are doing so in a responsible way. And the best way for us to do it is to do it with a scalpel, not a machete, and to make sure that the cuts we are making are not eliminating those things that are going to help us grow. One percentage point of additional economic growth next year or the year after actually would do more to close the deficit than anything else that we could do, because it brings in more revenues. So you know, if we could make sure that we are eliminating wasteful programs while at the same time growing the economy, that should be the sweet spot that we are aiming for. ENTITY, why is no one who supported the health-care bill running on it ? Well, I think that you have seen a couple hundred million dollars' worth of negative TV ads that make it very difficult to do so.

One of the most beautiful rivers in the country--I say one of the most beautiful, not the most beautiful, necessarily--is named for this same Hendrik Hudson.

They built railroads, ranches, buildings--one of the greatest apartments in this area of Washington was built by Dutch capital. We are grateful for that.

And I think in all those areas, in the education area, in the health care area, I think we will be judged by whether we made the most of what is truly a magic moment. The last time we had this sustained rate of economic growth with low inflation was in the early sixties, about 40 years ago. And if you look at the indicators now, compared to then in the aggregate, I think you would say our economy is stronger today, but there were a couple of years there where unemployment averaged under 4 percent and without much inflation. And it all came apart, first trying to come to grips with the civil rights crisis at home and then trying to pay for the war on poverty and the war for equal opportunity and civil rights and the war in Vietnam abroad. So that, basically, we had a moment there that we lost, not only because we became divided as a people politically but because our system simply could not accommodate building the America of our dreams. So what do you see as a threat to that? I mean, if the Vietnam period and all of that was a threat, what is the threat to that now? That is why I think we have no excuse not to really-this should be a truly historic moment in America. I cannot think of any time in our history when we have had this sort of opportunity. You might argue that it was similar, that the times which produced Theodore Roosevelt's administration, and then Woodrow Wilson's, were similar, where we were an emerging global power, we were basically at peace, where the world was becoming more integrated.

I do not think the question has ever been messing with the total tally. They just said there was no change in vote. They just said that. They just said that. I did not speak to Russians.

And like I said, what happens in Sierra Leone is going to be a little test of that.  You had it in principle. I think I had a very because I'd been interested in it since I was a student in college, and I'd always been fascinated by world affairs. So the fact that I had not been a Senator or served in a previous administration I do not think was a particular disadvantage. I think all the economic stuff I think I had right and the fact that there was a lot more in economics involved, and it was about democracy; it was about minimizing war; it was about lifting people's sights so they had something better to do than killing their neighbors, be they were of a different religion or ethnic group I think we had that right. I think we basically had the nuclear issues right, and the big power issues right with Russia, with China, what we tried to do in the Korean Peninsula.

I mean, we had a lot of frustrations and we got panned a lot, and maybe we deserved some of it, and maybe we did not in '93 and '94, trying to put together some kind of coalition of our European allies to move in Bosnia. In Kosovo, having had the Bosnia experience, even though there were differences in the alliance, I have nothing but compliments for my allies. They were basically we had our arguments. Nobody has got a monopoly on truth. But basically, we got together; we moved quickly; we did the right things.

At least that was where he was coming out of. I never asked him what his current party affiliation was, because it did not matter. I just knew he was going to give me good advice. But have you been able to forge similar relationships with foreign leaders? Because one of the criticisms people make about your style of diplomacy is that it is very cool, it is aloof, that you do not pal around with these guys. I was not in other Administrations, so I did not see the interactions between U.S. Presidents and various world leaders. But the friendships and the bonds of trust that I have been able to forge with a whole range of leaders is precisely, or is a big part of, what has allowed us to execute effective diplomacy. I think that if you ask them, Angela Merkel or Prime Minister Singh or President Lee or Prime Minister Erdogan or David Cameron would say, We have a lot of trust and confidence in the ENTITY. We believe what he says. We believe that he will follow through on his commitments. We think he is paying attention to our concerns and our interests. And that is part of the reason we have been able to forge these close working relationships and gotten a whole bunch of stuff done. You just cannot do it with John Boehner. You know, the truth is, actually, when it comes to Congress, the issue is not personal relationships. My suspicion is that this whole critique has to do with the fact that I do not go to a lot of Washington parties. And as a consequence, the Washington press corps maybe just does not feel like I am in the mix enough with them, and they figure, well, if I am not spending time with them, I must be cold and aloof.

{"id": 416, "text": "You will remember that in the summer of 1982 Beirut was being shelled in every direction, and in 1976 the authorities there had asked the Syrians to come in and help keep order, because the Government of Lebanon was virtually nonexistent and powerless to do anything about it. The multinational force moved in and created conditions that led to the partial withdrawal of the Israelis. Even after a request from the Lebanese Government to withdraw, the Syrians have refused, and they are still there. We believe that the purpose of the multinational force would be accomplished with the withdrawal of the other foreign powers and the establishment of a stable Lebanese Government, supported by a rebuilt Lebanese ENTITY. We have done a fine job of training and equipping the Lebanese ENTITY. The idea was that as the foreign forces left and as the Lebanese forces moved out toward their borders to reinstitute control and stop the internecine fight, the multinational force would maintain order for example, in areas like Beirut because the Lebanese military could not do both. I think that, with all that is happening, we are overlooking the progress that is been made. At recent discussions in Geneva, all of those involved even those who are presently hostile agreed to recognize the Gemayel government as the legitimate Government of Lebanon. Another sign of progress is the fact, as I mentioned, that the Lebanese ENTITY has been brought up to a capability it did not have before. But now further progress hinges particularly on Syria, which is the stopping block in its refusal to withdraw even though it had once agreed to leave and said that if Israel left, it would leave. I think that even if they gave an assurance that they are going to go and start the process maybe we could then leave. With the prospect of continuing widespread terrorist attacks, how can the United States retaliate, especially when such attacks are inspired or sponsored by governments? One of the hardest things, of course, is to prove that the terrorist attacks are sponsored by a government. For example, these groups that are taking credit for the recent suicide attacks are believed to have an Iranian connection. There is a faction of Iranians that believe in a holy war. We do have the evidence that Khomeini has spoken a number of times about advocating a holy war in the Moslem world to promote his type of fundamentalism. So, it is hard not to believe that he must, in some way, instigate or at least egg on those that are doing these things.

You are obviously from a more progressive wing in the Democratic party than President Biden, who got elected in part by pledging to work across party lines. And as you clearly know, the bipartisan infrastructure bill seems stall because Democratic moderates in the Senate are balking at the price tag of a separated but related budget resolution that is key to the House even taking up the infrastructure bill. Is this split among Democrats, what do you make of it? I mean, is it healthy in your view? Well, I certainly do not think it is healthy that ExxonMobil lobbyists are bragging about how many senators, Democrat and Republican, that they get to have on speed dial and enjoy exclusive access to shaping the contours of this quote, unquote bipartisan infrastructure bill. I think the role of dark money and the fossil fuel lobby is extremely unhealthy for our democracy.

They have money, these lobbyists and special interests have money, but we have got people. The Build Back Better Act has popular support, and even going above and beyond that, the Green New Deal has popular support even among Republicans and Independents.

Well, they have signed something that says you can change borders by peaceful means. ENTITY, you used a very good phrase at Helsinki.

Well, Martin, I go back to the peace treaties of Yalta and Paris and Potsdam and the agreement by the Germans themselves to establish those borders. Those were peace treaties that established borders for all of Eastern Europe and all of Western Europe. Those are factual things done in the forties, the fifties, et cetera.

{"id": 4992, "text": "Over a month ago, Speaker Newt Gingrich and I met with a group of senior citizens in Claremont, New Hampshire. That sunlit event had a special spirit. We showed that the great debate now occurring in our country can and should be conducted with civility and a sense of common ground. Many Americans of both parties have told me since then that this is exactly the way they want their leaders to work together. And that is what I am committed to doing. Perhaps the most visible example of that spirit of New Hampshire came when the Speaker and I shook hands on the question of political reform, something that has divided the two parties and the Congress and the country for too long. The first question we answered was from a retired steelworker named Frank McConnell. He said that politics had become polluted by special interests and that too often the voice of the people was shut out. He said that bickering between the parties had blocked reform for too long, and he proposed that we create a blueribbon, bipartisan commission to write reforms to curb the power of special interests. There, in front of the entire country, the Speaker and I agreed to create this commission. A bipartisan commission could cut the knot that is strangling change. This panel would follow the approach that has worked on other critical issues. It would be comprised of distinguished citizens and would recommend broad changes in the rules which cover lobbyists and in how we finance political campaigns. Most important of all, the Congress would have to vote within a strict deadline, up or down, on the the package as a whole, no loopholes, no amendments. I am happy to report that in addition to myself and Speaker Gingrich, this very idea has been strongly endorsed for some time by Senate majority leader Bob Dole, who just last February said again that this was the way we ought to approach this question. It is clearer than ever that we need political reform. The American people believe their political system is too influenced by narrow interests, that our Government serves the powerful but not hard-working families. Even before the '94 elections, the special interests prevented passage of both campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation that I had strongly asked the Congress to pass. When a minority in the Senate killed lobbying reform in 1994, lobbyists were standing right outside the Senate chamber cheering. Since the New Congress came in, I am sad to say, it is gotten worse, for even more power has been given to the lobbyists.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress310", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-310", "publication_date": "22-07-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We are the country of Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Frederick Douglas. We are the land of Wild Bill Hickock and Buffalo Bill Cody. We are the nation that gave rise to the Wright brothers, the Tuskegee airmen, Harriet Tubman, Clara Barton, Jesse Owens, George Patton, General George Patton, the great Louis Armstrong, Alan Shepard, Elvis Presley, and Muhammad Ali, and only America could have produced them all. We are the culture that put up the Hoover Dam, laid down the highways, and sculpted the skyline of Manhattan. We are the people who dreamed the spectacular dream, it was called Las Vegas in the Nevada desert, who built up Miami from the Florida marsh, and who carved our heroes into the face of Mount Rushmore. Americans harnessed electricity, split the atom, and gave the world the telephone and the internet. We settled the Wild West, won two World Wars, landed American astronauts on the moon. And one day very soon, we will plant our flag on Mars. We gave the world the poetry of Walt Whitman, the stories of Mark Twain, the songs of Irving Berlin, the voice of Ella Fitzgerald, the style of Frank Sinatra, the comedy of Bob Hope, the power of the Saturn V rocket, the toughness of the Ford F150, and the awesome might of the American aircraft carriers. Americans must never lose sight of this miraculous story. We should never lose sight of it. Nobody has ever done it like we have done it. So today, under the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I am announcing the creation of a new monument to the giants of our past. I am signing an executive order to establish the National Guard of American heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live.

So that is why I am calling on Congress to send me an education reform bill I can sign into law before the next school year begins before next year's school year. I want every child in this country to head back to school in the fall knowing that their education is America's priority. Let us seize this education moment. Let us fix No Child Left Behind. Now, last week, we got a reminder of why it is so critical that we reform this law. According to new estimates, under the system No Child Left Behind put in place, more than 80 percent of our schools may be labeled as failing 80 percent of our schools. And let us face it, skepticism is somewhat justified. We know that four out of five schools in this country are not failing. So what we are doing to measure success and failure is out of line. In fact, the list of supposedly failing schools is includes schools that are making extraordinary progress, including Kenmore. So yes, we have still got more work to do here at this school to close the achievement gap. I think Dr. Word would agree with that. We have got to make sure that every student is on track. But I mean, we can see here at Kenmore what Kenmore's thriving. You got more work to do, but you are doing fine. So what this means, though, is, is that we need a better way of figuring out which schools are deeply in trouble, which schools are not , and how we get not only the schools that are in really bad shape on track, how do we help provide the tools to schools that want to get even better to get better. That way of measuring success and failure, that is the first problem with No Child Left Behind that we need to fix. Instead of labeling schools a failure one day and then throwing up our hands and walking away from them, we need to refocus on the schools that need the most help.

And the problem of long-term unemployment, once you get beyond a certain point, history shows us that they never get a job again.

We are still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started. And our balance of payments deficit is going up.

What I am saying is, we will be giving each of these things consideration on that basis that I just outlined. Well, let me ask another concept question, then. Well, the way the Treasury proposal lowers individual tax rates is by increasing corporate taxes by 37 percent. Again, as a concept, do you generally favor that approach of individual versus corporate taxes? The corporate tax is given a ceiling of lower than the- Not the rates, but overall corporate taxes would go up about 37 percent under the Treasury proposal while individual taxes would come down. Is that a general approach that you endorse? I, as I say, I have not even made an attempt to study that bill in detail that much to know that. I assume that that would mean things that would be taken away from them that are present deductions. I would have to be convinced of the need to do that, because I am a believer that one day we must recognize that only people pay taxes. And someday I would hope that we could arrive at a tax structure that would recognize that you cannot tax things; you only tax people. Well, you also said last night that this was not going to be a tax increase under any disguise. If the bill is modified to meet the objections of some critics, whether it is from the business community or elsewhere, could it be that the bill would be a revenue loser? And would that be acceptable to you? I think what we are talking about here is a tax reform, and you are striving for neutrality in this. Now, in that kind of a reform, I am also sure that there are going to be some people, obviously, who are going to pay more tax than they are paying now. But, then, you are talking about people who are unfairly not paying a share of the tax today. And if you-the aim of this kind of a tax program, and I think this is true of all three of the proposals that are now before us-the two that are up in the Congress now, plus this Treasury report-I think it is true that one of the targets there is the large amount of tax that is not being paid, many times legally, by virtue of the complexities of the present tax laws, in which some who fairly should be paying a share are avoiding it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgroupseniorexecutivesandstaffmembersfromthewallstreetjournal", "title": "Interview With a Group of Senior Executives and Staff Members From the Wall Street Journal", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-group-senior-executives-and-staff-members-from-the-wall-street-journal", "publication_date": "07-02-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Do you see any real hope in a booming economy where we still have to have this many unemployed, that in the next, say, 5 years, a second term for you, for instance, we can find a solution to this problem? What it is, it seems to me, is a combination of actions which we are trying to take. What we have to realize is that to even stand still, stay still, we have to move very fast. We have 2 1/2 million more people working than when I came to office and yet a million and a half more people have come into the labor market. The answer, it seems to me, lies in a whole variety of programs. That would be an $11 billion tax cut in a period of 18 months. We are not doing this just because though, of course, everybody would like to have their taxes reduced, but the major reason is because the lift it will give the economy, the assurance it will give us against another recession. So, in answer to your question, I believe that with the combination of the tax cut plus these other programs we can reduce that unemployment from the 5 1/2 percent. Most importantly, we can prevent it from being increased and I think we can get it under 5 percent in the period of 2 years, 2 1/2 years, but we cannot do it by just saying it will be done on its own.

I think what would be most desirable is, after all of this discussion and debate then to get a very strong vote in the Senate.

I mean if you look at just, you know, hundreds of thousands, now millions of jobs being shed over the course of two months -- or three months, that slope is a lot steeper than anything that we have said -- we have seen before.

An enormous amount of the credit for that development goes to its leaders and particularly to our honored guest tonight. I know that all Americans, as they think of the Congo, know that the ENTITY has often referred to his country as being the heart of Africa. I think all of us at this table tonight would speak from our hearts to the heart of Africa when we raise our glasses to the health of the ENTITY of the Congo and Mrs. Mobutu. President Mobutu responded in French. President, Mrs. Nixon, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests: I followed very closely your brilliant presentation, Mr. President. And now I should like to express on behalf of my wife and my delegation and in the name of my people-what I should like to say here tonight, Mr. ENTITY, publicly, is, first of all, all our thanks to your country for everything that you have done for my country for more than the last 10 years. This morning in response to your kind words of welcome, and at the State Department in response to Secretary Rogers' toast, I said this very forcefully, that in coming here I was bringing the message of gratitude and friendship to the American people, and I said to Secretary Rogers that we have a saying in the Congo that it is in adversity that you know your friends. My country, beset with problems and difficulties from 1960 to 1965, my country had added a word to the international vocabulary. But fortunately, the American people, with all its succeeding ENTITYs since ENTITY Kennedy, ENTITY Johnson, and yourself, Mr. ENTITY, was never discouraged and continued to follow the same consistent line of confidence in my country and today we witness the crowning moment of this task of confidence.

Does the administration have an opinion on that and does the administration consider -- will it consider any future request from the IMF for further funding?

It is a pleasure for me to receive this award, representing a typical American family, and I want to thank you for it. As a matter of fact, I had my typical American family this past weekend at Camp David, 30 of the members of my family. After 2 or 3 intense days of negotiation, I think we reached a framework for peace among ourselves. It was nice to keep my family out of the news for a few days. It was one of the most delightful experiences in many years for me. We have a large family, a close family, an exciting family, and one which has given one another great help and support and encouragement in times of difficulty or excitement or joy or achievement or sorrow. There is nothing that gives me more pleasure, even as President of the United States, than to have Amy come to me in the evening, when I am tired and concerned and worried, and put her arms around my neck and give me a kiss. And she now is proud to call herself a double-digit preteenager. She is a great young lady and the joy of our lives. And I was able to have with me in the last few days my two grandsons. And we are expecting, I hope, a new granddaughter in just a few days from now. When I was invited to come here for this special observance of the family-what it means under the guidance of Jesus Christ and the great Nation of the United States of America, supported and strengthened by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, publicized and promoted by this special week I wondered what I wanted to say to you.

Well, let me remind you, sir, that we have had several thousand troops in Somalia. We have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the former Yugoslavia. We have done airdrops of supplies. We have always been committed to use our air power to protect your troops and any other troops. We have not wanted to get the Untied States involved in the conflict there unless there was a settlement. I have always said that we would send appropriate military personnel to be part of a United Nations enforcement of the settlement. Let me also say that the closest we ever were to settling that was when the Serbs and the Croats thought that the Europeans were going to go along with my proposal to lift the arms embargo and to make available standby air power to enforce no use of the Serbian artillery against the Muslim, the Bosnian government there while the arms embargo was being lifted. When it became obvious that I could not prevail in the United Nations because of the opposition of some of the European nations, that is when things began to deteriorate again instead of move toward peace. So I had a policy. I am disappointed that it was rejected by some of the European countries. I am grateful that the Germans and some others supported it. But we are prepared to do our part to try to resolve this. We are working weekly on it. I feel terrible about it. But I do not believe the United States needs to send a lot of troops there which might get involved in a civil war on the ground when we had a plan-which would have led, I am convinced, to a settlement-which was not accepted. If we get a settlement, as we might now under other conditions, we are prepared to do our part through the U.N. to help to enforce it. We will be back with President Clinton. This is funny, folks, what happens behind the scenes, so we will make it public for you. We had arranged with President Clinton's staff that we would finish at 10 p.m. Eastern time, one hour, and the staff had arranged it with our producers.

We are going to find other areas where we can improve and increase our relationship cultural exchanges, things of that kind. All of this, I think, is on a good track. We have made some gains. What strategy does the administration intend to pursue in Central America? Is it to underwrite the Government of El Salvador indefinitely? And in Nicaragua, is it to settle for nothing less than the overthrow of the Sandinistas? Our policy in Central America is regional. We are supporting the efforts of the Contadora group Mexico, Venezuela, Panama, and Colombia-to assure that democratic elections are used to settle the internal political conflicts and that verified agreements assure peace among the countries. They are beset by Cuban- and Soviet-backed insurgents who do not want that kind of government. They want the old-fashioned idea that we have seen for the last few hundred years the idea that if you have a revolution, it is only to exchange one set of rules for another set of rulers. No. This is to be revolution to change that process. At the same time that the Government in El Salvador is fighting against this potent enemy on the left, they are being harassed from behind by small violent right-wing groups who want to go back to the old concept of government over the people, not by the people. So, we should not be blaming the present Government of El Salvador for not being able to deal effectively with these rightists when it is beset by this other force on the left. I think that the thing that is dragging this out are the limitations placed on our aid by the Congress. It is almost as if they are saying, Well, we will give you just enough to let them bleed to death slowly. What we really need and remember that threefourths of our aid is for economic and social reforms, and the other 25 cents out of each dollar is for military aid is the kind of aid that will let them accomplish the job and eliminate this left-wing guerrilla force that is doing the attacking.

I just do not think the American people want that, and I do not think the people of Pennsylvania do. In recent polls-you keep talking about the recovery that is occurring, and I have no doubt that there is a recovery in certain parts of the country if they just bear that out. Here in the Northeast, however, there is no recovery; at least the perception is there is no recovery. There was a recent poll out by the Tarrence group that shows that only a third of Americans believe the claims of a recovery. My whole point to you, or my question to you is, why is it that this is the perception? It cannot simply be because Republicans are trying to stonewall things in the Congress so there is gridlock? No, I think-well, I do believe that people have not gotten a lot of the information; I think that is true. But I think-keep in mind what I said first. I think a lot of people may hear that there are more jobs, but they may feel that their personal situation is not more secure. That is, they may think, Well, I am still not going to get a raise, or I might lose my job, or I might lose my health benefits. Another million Americans lost their health care last year. That is why Harris Wofford and I worked so hard to protect the health care benefits of working people and to try to change the law so that they would not lose their health care. But the point I am trying to make to the American people is that we are making them more secure-that is what the family leave law was all about, that is what these efforts to improve the health of our children are all about, that is what the crime bill is all about-that our economic policy is working. So the issue is, do you want to keep working for something that is plainly taking us in the right direction, or do you want to buy this Republican snake oil, you know, We are going to give everybody a tax cut and balance the budget and increase everybody's spending, and we will tell you how we are going to pay for that after the election.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdonlancerkywradiophiladelphia", "title": "Interview With Don Lancer of KYW Radio, Philadelphia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-don-lancer-kyw-radio-philadelphia", "publication_date": "31-10-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I thank them for coming and for devoting themselves to the proposition that the best way they can honor Ed Plank is to do whatever can be done to stop this madness from killing more Americans. Let me say to all of you that this issue is especially close to me. Most of you, because of what you do, probably know I grew up in an alcoholic home, and I have a brother I love very much who could have been killed by the cocaine habit he had. And we all have to do whatever we can to get it out of our lives. We have to deal with the question of law enforcement and punishment. We have to deal with education and treatment and prevention. We have to deal with all those things that can be done by the President and all those things that can be done by legislators at the national, State, and local level. But in the end, this problem will be changed when America changes, when we assume responsibility for ourselves, our families, and our communities. And therefore, what you are doing-what you are doing-and what other Americans are doing in attempting to assert that sort of responsibility over their own lives for their families and for their communities is the most important thing that can be done in America today. And it is up to the rest of us to support you as well as we possibly can. Of course, parents have a special role to play because we all know that the best crime prevention, the best antidrug program in this country always has been a good family with strong parents. We know that it is the Government's job to uphold the law, to promote order, but parents must teach right from wrong, and we must all support that.

I wanted to know if Congress does-it looks like the first thing they are going to do when they come back into town is work on the Elian Gonzalez case. If they did pass a private bill in both Houses and they feel like politically they have got enough backing to do that, what would you do with that bill if it got to your desk? I have not thought about it. I think it would be-this is not Winston Churchill, for one thing. You know, I do not think that Congress should put its-unless they know more about the facts than I do, I do not think they should put themselves in the position of making a decision that runs contrary to what the people who have had to do all the investigation have done. I think that, obviously, if they believe the INS made a mistake, their decision is subject to challenge in Federal court. And the Congress-even Members of Congress can petition to be heard there. But I think that we are setting a-I think that it would irrevocably lead people to the conclusion that this was much more about politics than it was whether that little boy ought to be taken away from his father. They are basically taking a position that if you live in Cuba, if we can take you away from your father, you are better off-your parents. And I think that is -the INS reached a different decision, having exhaustively looked at what was best for that child. As you all know, I have no sympathy for the Castro regime. I signed the present bill. I think it is tragic how they have blown every conceivable opportunity to get closer to the United States. Just as we were making progress, they murdered those pilots. But I think that we need to think long and hard whether we are going to take the position that any person who comes to our shores who is a minor, any minor child who loses his or her parents should never be sent home to another parent, even if that parent is capable of doing a very good job, if we do not like the Government of the country where the people lived.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfrancinekieferandskipthurmanthechristiansciencemonitorboston", "title": "Interview With Francine Kiefer and Skip Thurman of the Christian Science Monitor in Boston", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-francine-kiefer-and-skip-thurman-the-christian-science-monitor-boston", "publication_date": "18-01-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

For more than 3 months, the United States and the international community have very patiently sought a diplomatic solution to Iraq's decision to end all its cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq's continued refusal to embrace a diplomatic, peaceful solution, its continued defiance of even more United Nations resolutions, makes it plainer than ever that its real goal is to end the sanctions without giving up its weapons of mass destruction program. The Security Council and the world have made it crystal clear now that this is unacceptable, that none of us can tolerate an Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity. Still, Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM. Just yesterday his own neighbors in the Arab world made it clear that this choice is his alone and the consequences, if he fails to comply, his alone in terms of responsibility. Now, let me say to all of you, this is a very good day for the United States. I want to thank Officer Sandra Grace from New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Detective Gary McLhinney from Baltimore for their service, for sharing their stories, for representing their organizations so well, for reminding us why all of those here have worked so hard to pass the laws that in a few moments I will sign, laws to help us honor the memory of law enforcement officers by helping to prevent the kind of gun-related crimes that took their lives and by supporting the families they leave behind.

I am willing to compromise, but I do not think that we ought to gut the main purposes of the background check. And again, you know, they say, Well, we have these shows out in the country. They occur on the weekend. They are not all basically at big-city convention centers. But the gun could be deposited with the local sheriff's office for the weekend while the background check is completed, for example. You could deposit the gun and the check and return one or the other or both. It would be easy to work through this if they really wanted to.

For all of its problems, it is been quite successful. And when you do the insta-check, you know, we have to do instant checks whenever we can-when you do the insta-check, you actually-you lose some people, because if you cannot wait 3 days, there are some records that have not been logged in, for example, that will not be picked up on the insta-check. But when we passed the Brady bill, that is the best we could do. We had to take a bill that would say a 3-day waiting period, but insta-check whenever possible when it became possible.

Now, you took some heat for the whole leading-from-behind tactic here with Libya. Well, the truth was, we this was a phrase that the media picked up on. But it is not one that I ever used. We lead from the front. We introduced the resolution in the United Nations that allowed us to protect civilians in Libya when Gaddafi was threatening to slaughter them. It was our extraordinary men and women in uniform, our pilots who took out their air defense systems, set up a no-fly zone. It was our folks in NATO who were helping to coordinate the NATO operation there. And the difference here is we were able to organize the international community. We were able to get the U.N. mandate for the operation. And so there was never this sense that somehow we were unilaterally making a decision to take out somebody. And that is part of the reason why this whole thing only cost us a billion dollars Not a single U.S. troop was on the ground. Not a single U.S. troop was killed or injured, and that, I think, is a recipe for success in the future. Let me ask you about that because, with Osama Bin Laden, I remember the night before you were at the correspondence dinner and the whole deal. How hard was it to make that decision to send in those Navy SEALs?

They are a source of pride for generations. It was representative of what it meant to get into the middle class. You work hard in this job, you could afford to raise a family, buy a house, go on vacation, retire with some dignity. You knew you were making something that people could count on. It meant something. Every car you sent off the line brought you that step closer to doing the right thing by your family and giving something to your kids and having a sense of security in your life. So plants like this one built more than just cars, they built the middle class in this country. So in exchange for the help, we demanded responsibility. We said to the auto industry, you have got to change with the times. Labor and management worked together, settled their differences. Everybody put some skin in the game. Everybody made some sacrifices.

I know he spoke with the Chancellor, I believe, it was last week. I'd have to look back at the specific details of their conversation, but I know that they spoke within the last week. The other thing is that Congressman Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania is expected, if not today, sometime in the coming weeks, to announce he is not running for reelection, making him the 38th Republican House member to announce retirement, resignation, or pursuit of another office -- a post-World War II high in the exodus of Republican House members. And do members call him when they say they will make announcements like this? Certainly, he is had conversations with a number of members. I cannot speak to this situation specifically and whether or not he is spoken with the President.

But I think so unlike what most people would have of a concept of royalty. If I may switch to a different subject-your Orlando speech. In your Orlando speech you talked about the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union as a confrontation of good and evil, and darkness and light. And that gave the impression, at least, that there is really no logical conclusion except war and that reconciliation would be very difficult between the two powers. And I am just wondering how you reconcile that outlook with your aims for peace. Well, ENTITY, I do not think that those who were there and heard the entire speech would take it that way. I think it is somehow lifting that out of context-of this line and this description as the focus of evil and so forth. Certainly their entire beliefs, beginning with the disbelief in God-their entire beliefs are so contrary to what we accept as morality. But no, what I was pointing out there, and I still believe is time-tested and proven, is not the inevitability of war, but a recognition and a willingness to face up to what these differences are in our views and between us, to be realistic about it. But let me just point out a couple of things. We have seen, under the guise of diplomacy and detente and so forth in the past, efforts to kind of sweep the differences under the rug and pretend they do not exist. I have stated, very frankly, what I believe the differences are, but at the same time, I have expressed my determination and my belief that peace is achievable. I am very concerned with those people who somehow seem to think-without their realizing they are thinking them-that they are building in their mind a kind of war is inevitable .

They are still trying to get back on their feet.

ENTITY, you just mentioned jobs. You talked about unemployment. The unemployment statistics are out for December; the trend continues downward. When will America reach that magic 5-percent number that the economists say is full employment? Well, I have asked our people to take some close looks at what is full employment anymore. It seems strange to me that we are still talking about a figure down there that has to do with the people who, through no fault of their own, are unemployed. And yet, at the same time, we have, today, virtually 110 million people employed. But the potential employment pool consists of all people, male and female, between the ages of 16 and 65. Today the highest percentage of that potential pool is employed than has ever been employed in our entire history. So, do we honestly know what the figure of full employment is? I do know that if you take the present unemployed in our country, and you go down to what could be considered possible long-term unemployment or the potentially unemployed-permanently unemployed, I should say, not potentially, you will find that only a small percentage of the unemployed have been unemployed for 26 weeks or longer. And everyone else, in other words, fits into that pool of people who are either new entrants into the job market-just as last month, when the figures showed this morning, when we increased employment by 230,000 in the last month, at the same time the job market increased by 90,000 people.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithindependentnetworkwashingtonbureauchiefs", "title": "Interview With Independent Network Washington Bureau Chiefs", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-independent-network-washington-bureau-chiefs", "publication_date": "08-01-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It was a key milestone on the path to the end of the cold war. The specter of Soviet tanks rolling westward across the northern German plains no longer haunts us. Saddam Hussein confirmed that. The tragic violence in Bosnia reminds us of that every day. The proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is unfortunately a growing, not a receding, menace.

Yes, we are reducing the defense budget because of the end of the cold war, but we are not downsizing for its own sake, we are trying to rightsize our security for security's sake.

And the President gave a powerful speech -- a sermon at a memorial service in Charleston about 18 months ago, and that certainly captured the attention of the American people as well. And to the extent that the President was able to contribute to a healthy examination of some of these issues and a healthy debate and discussion and dialogue in this country, he is pleased with that. One example, one manifestation of that is the way that a lot of people reconsidered their view of the confederate flag in light of these issues, in terms of what it symbolizes.

And he-I just cannot tell you how- what a kind person he was and, at the same time, represented his great country's interests very well. I do want to make something clear in the speech I gave today. I said that-as to the Kashmir interest-issue, America supports a solution that is acceptable to all sides. As you might recall, in my remarks, I said, to both sides. I would like the record to be so that the world hears me say, all sides. I fully understand that the deal has to be acceptable to the Indians, Paks, as well as the citizens of Kashmir.

Well, as you know, there was a history, particularly during the cold war, that made it difficult for our countries to establish a close relationship. However, things change in the world. Secondly, the Indian economy, as a result of more transparency and openness and trade, began to change. And as the Indian economy changed, it changed the commercial relationship between the United States and India. Thirdly, there are some common threats that make it in our interests to work to-gether-namely terrorism. As I said in my speech today, the United States has been attacked, but India certainly understands what it means to have suffering as a result of terrorist activities. And so there is common interests that have helped to change the relationship. And I intend to seize those interests, as does the Prime Minister, in order to foster what we have called a strategic relationship.

And what I did not want is a situation in which we are just continually sending more and more troops, or putting more and more resources, without having looked at how the whole thing fits together; making sure that our efforts, in terms of building Afghan capacity is in place, that our civilian and diplomatic efforts are in place. So what we are going to do is continue to reassess, review what is taking place, and make sure that our strategy and resources fit together for the aim of making sure that al Qaeda is not able to attack the United States . You announced yesterday a major change in American strategic strategy when you said that we would not go forward with the missile defense system that would be there on the border of Russia. The Russians saw that as a poke in the eye from the very beginning.

{"id": 4180, "text": "See, lawsuits not only drive up premiums, which drives up the cost to the patient or the employer of the patient, but lawsuits cause docs to practice medicine in an expensive way in order to protect themselves in the courthouse. The defensive practice of medicine affects the Federal budget. The direct cost of liability insurance and the indirect cost from unnecessary medical procedures raise the Federal Government's health care costs by at least $28 billion a year. Remember, we provide-at the Federal level, we provide health care through Medicare and Medicaid and veteran's health and Government employee costs. The defensive-the cost of defensive medicine raises your bill as a taxpayer. Not only does it make it harder to go see a doc, it also costs you more as a taxpayer. Medical liability reform is a national issue because medical liability lawsuits raise the Federal budget. It is a national issue that requires a national solution. You need to get your Governor-I know he is strongly, and the Lieutenant Governor is strongly in favor of liability reform-you need to work it here in Arkansas, by the way. It is tough, because some of these lawyer groups are some of the politically strongest groups in the State and the country. But we are doing the right thing by insisting upon medical liability reform. We are doing the right thing by telling people the truth, and that is the health care system looks like a giant lottery. That is what it looks like these days because of these lawsuits. And somehow, the trial lawyers always hold the winning ticket. Lawyers walk away with up to 40 percent- 40 percent-of every settlement and verdict, which adds up to billions of costs, billions of unnecessary costs. Lawsuits do not heal patients. And they are driving a wedge between the docs and their patients. One of the most vital links of good medicine is the doctor-patient relationship. Yet many doctors fear what they tell a patient will be used against them in a court of law. We have got a culture of lawsuit here in America, a culture of lawsuits, a litigation culture, which is driving a wedge between the doctors and patients, and that is not right. When docs treat their patients, the only thing they should worry about is the health of their patients, not some trial lawyer breathing down their neck. Seventy-one percent of the doctors in Arkansas say they are considering early retirement.

And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and they are relatively large employers. And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give another year not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with Treasury and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing. This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that is starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on Republicans is consistent with the fact that they have voted to repeal this thing 38 times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, they have just given up on offering an alternative. So essentially -- their central economic plan that they are currently presenting involves making sure that 50 million Americans cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents' plan because they are 26 or under, that they suddenly do not have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class.

The percentage of fourth graders with basic math skills rose 10 points between 2000 and 2005. The percentage of eighth graders with basic math skills rose about six points between 2000 and 2005. African American fourth and eighth graders in North Carolina achieved some of the highest math scores in the Nation. It is got to make you feel good to hear African American kids are scoring some of the highest tests in the Nation. Can you imagine if the President came and said, By the way, your kids are scoring the lowest scores in the Nation ? I suspect you'd want to be doing something about that. In other words, we are measuring-each State measures, and you are able to norm to determine how States do relative to each other. In reading, 9-year-olds have made the largest gains in the past 5 years than at any point in the previous 28 years. In math, 9-year-olds and 13-year-olds earned the highest scores in the history of the test. We have an achievement gap in America that is-that I do not like and you should not like. It is the difference between reading of African American students and Latino students and White students. The gap is closing, and that is incredibly important for the United States of America, to see that achievement gap close. Inherent in No Child Left Behind are some interesting reforms. First, if we find a child falling behind early, there is extra Federal money to help that child. For the first time, the Federal Government has said, Not only do we want you to measure, but when we find a child falling behind, there is extra money to be used in either the private or public sector. See, measuring encourages parental involvement. If you measure and a parent finds out that his or her child is not succeeding, most parents are going to say, Do something about it. And what the Federal Government has said, Here is some extra money to help you, to get tutoring, to get you back up to grade level. If a school continues to fail-in other words, a school does not make progress- I believe parents ought to be liberated from that school district if they so choose and go to another public school.

Prime Minister Barak had a Cabinet meeting that lasted almost all night last night. And in the middle of it, he came out and announced that the Israelis would suspend their ultimatum, because they had some encouragement and there was so much effort being made by the world diplomatic community.

I think that they both became concerned about 24 hours ago, maybe a little more, that this thing could really slide into a much deeper conflict. So at least today we have pulled back from the precipice. Kofi Annan is out there, and I think he is doing some good work there. So I feel good today, as compared with yesterday. Although, if we can end the violence and if we can get agreement between the two sides on some sort of factfinding commission to figure out how this happened and how to keep it from happening again which was the thing that the U.N. resolution called for, that, in fact, Barak and Arafat had agreed to in Paris. Although they had not agreed to the composition of the commission, they had agreed that it ought to be done. If we can do that, the next big step is to begin the negotiations, the peace negotiations, as immediately as possible, because otherwise the sort of public pressures, both within the Middle East and beyond, will get worse.

If, in fact, my argument is right - that this is the best way for Iran not to get a nuclear weapon - then that is not just good for the United States, that is very good for Israel. In fact, historically, this has been the argument that has driven Prime Minister Netanyahu and achieved consensus throughout Israel. So the question has to be is there, in fact, a better path to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon than this one? And I have repeatedly asked both Prime Minister Netanyahu and others to present me a reasonable, realistic plan that would achieve exactly what this deal achieves, and I have yet to get a response. So, as I said yesterday, I completely understand why both he and the broad Israeli public would be suspicious, cautious about entering into any deal with Iran. But what I also try to remind everyone yesterday is, is that when we entered into arms treaties with the Soviet Union, they had missiles pointed at every single major American city. We actually had to constrain ourselves and reduce our firepower. Here, we are preserving all our options so that if Iran does cheat, we can still exercise the same set of options that we have in place today. And I have been very clear about the fact that if Israel were attacked by Iran, for example, there is no doubt that not just me, but any U.S. administration would do everything that we needed to do to make sure that Israel was protected. So there are all kinds of hedges if, in fact, Iran were not to abide by the deal. But if, in fact, Iran does abide by the deal, as it has the interim deal over the last two years, then we have purchased, at a very small price, one of the single most important national security objectives that both the United States and Israel has. There is been some debate about the amount of money that Iran will get as a result of sanctions relief. Whatever the amount is, it is clear, they are going to get some resources... and some part of it, and they being out of the sanctions regime, will be... will be - will be applied to their economy, but some of it...", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithfareedzakariacnnsgps", "title": "Interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN's GPS", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-fareed-zakaria-cnns-gps", "publication_date": "09-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

But it is even more tangible in baseball because we really know that they have got a shot. Now, you were telling us between innings that you had a chance to go down to Atlanta and see the layout there. I looked at the Olympic Stadium, which is magnificent. The American people will love it. And then after the Olympics, a section in the back is going to be taken down like what we now see from here over center field, and it is going to be converted into the Braves' new stadium. But the unique thing about it is, it is going to bethe base line is going to be even closer I mean, the foul line is going to be even closer tothe base lineto the stands than here. And home plate's going to be even tucked in tighter than here, so that the average distance from base line to the stands will be about 45 feet. And the major league ballparks average something like 70 feet. So even though the Braves have this magnificent pitching staff, they are going to be tested because they will not get as many easy foul-outs. In comes Hammonds, and he makes the catch for out number two. Well, that is a good point because, I mean, the current stadium in Atlanta probably has more foul territory than any other ballpark.

And I can guarantee you that the moment the Iranian regime stopped engaging in that kind of rhetoric and that kind of behavior that Iran would just by virtue of its size, talent, resources, immediately rise in its influence and its power in the eyes of the world. It will require a shift in the politics and the leadership of Iran a different mindset in terms of how they are approaching the rest of the world and how they are approaching countries like the United States. We have got another video question for you from an Iranian-American, dual citizen. I'd like to know if you believe that this deal can lead to a shift in the internal politics in Iran and bring about positive reforms there. And if so, is this deal going to be at the cost of our relationships with current allies in the Middle East. Well, as I just said, I try to be modest about this. This deal is a good deal regardless of whether the character of the current Iranian regime changes. As long as they are sticking with the deal, we are solving a big problem, which is Iran not having a nuclear weapon and not triggering a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It is possible that as a consequence of sanctions coming down, more commerce, more trade, more Iranian young people and professionals traveling overseas that some of the suspicions and barriers come down, but it is not automatic. That will depend, I think, on the nature of events inside of Iran. There is great suspicion of this deal among some of our closest allies, Israel in particular, but also some of the Gulf States, who have seen Iran's actions trying to destabilize their governments or sponsoring terrorist proxies. And what I am convinced of is that this deal is a good deal even as we work with those allies to constrain Iranian actions in some of these other areas. But what I can also say for certain is that if Iran started behaving differently, if it was not sponsoring terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, if it was not destabilizing its neighbors, that would be welcomed by those neighbors.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjakehorowitzmic", "title": "Interview with Jake Horowitz of Mic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jake-horowitz-mic", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that there is almost a kneejerk habit right now that if I am for it, then they have got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of Republicans who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But they have got to work through that pattern that is developed over the last couple of years. On the economy, the Fed is obviously an important player. You have got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman?

I have narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates. And what I am looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that that is not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better. And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there is still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let us make sure that we are growing the economy, but let us also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let us make sure that we are not creating new bubbles.

Some of them were going up the other day. You can find them going up, and you can find them going down. You can pretty much find out what you want in polls, is my point. What about the theory that your Presidency is moving from one dominated by foreign policy to one of domestic policy? Ironically, now that some of things are settling down in Iraq and Afghanistan and you are facing tough issues like Social Security, it is a little tougher road to hoe. My thoughts are the ENTITY has always got to balance foreign policy and domestic policy, and I will I did so in the first term.

We have been monitoring this hurricane closely and the devastation it is caused. While the catastrophic flooding was not as severe as it was during Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago, Ida was so powerful that it caused the Mississippi River to change direction, the flow, changed the flow temporarily. The good news is that as a result of a significant multi-billion dollar federal investment in the levee system around Metro in New Orleans, it held, it was strong, it worked.

I think this is the right thing to do for the country, and I hope it passes, but I am scared I will get beat if I vote for it. first of all, by recreating an aggressive communications strategy, more like what we did in the campaign, to try to combat what we think are false claims against this plan and just to get the information out about it; and secondly, to ask everybody to imagine what it is going to be like, not the day after the vote but after we have had a chance to continue our spending cut program through the Vice President's reinventing Government initiative and through other cuts that will come when we have got a chance to deal with health care and welfare reform and the crime bill and these other issues.

The challenge is us making sure that we have got the interdiction capacity, the intelligence, that we are building a much stronger defence against some of these proxy wars and asymmetric efforts.

We also need agricultural specialists. We need gendarmes to help train the police. We need people who understand water systems and electrical systems. So there is more than enough work to do, and I am very pleased so far that the NATO community feels, I think, unified in the approach that we have put forward. You are loved by a lot of French people. They really see you as a model. What do you want again to say to the young people who are inspired by you and who are going through a very difficult time at this moment? Well, you know, I think that the main thing I always want to tell young people is that if they work hard and they are not constrained by the status quo, by what has happened before, then they can remake the world. Now, I think that they have to do it in a responsible way.

{"id": 425, "text": "And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and focused on what is best for our kids. You see, we know what is possible from our children when reform is not just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado, located on turf between two rival gangs. But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their families to go to college. And after the first year of the school's transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it. That is what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country. Let us also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as nation builders. Here in America, it is time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. If you want to make a difference in the life of our Nation, if you want to make a difference in the life of a child, become a teacher. Your country needs you. Of course, the education race does not end with a high school diploma. To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American. That is why we have ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students. And this year, I ask Congress to go further and make permanent our tuition tax credit, worth $10,000 for 4 years of college. Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today's fast-changing economy, we are also revitalizing America's community colleges.

It all depends on what the voters think the election is about. Now, I want you to remember this. We put in our economic program in 1993, and the Vice President broke the tie in the Congress, and the Republicans said it would be a disaster. Now, we have 20 million jobs, the longest peacetime expansion in history, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the lowest welfare rolls in 32 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates ever recorded, the lowest female unemployment rate in 40 years. The second thing I want to say is, we have the lowest crime rate in 25 years; 90 percent of our kids immunized against serious childhood diseases for the first time in history; over 2 million more kids covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program. We have cleaned up 3 times as many toxic waste dumps as the predecessor administrations, both of them. And we now have the lowest output of waste that is terribly damaging to the environment that we have had in 20 years. Twenty years ago we had 50 million fewer people. We have had 150,000 young people serve this country in AmeriCorps, 7 million young people take advantage of the HOPE scholarship to go on to community college and to other college education. We have had 10 million people get the benefit of the minimum wage, and over 20 million get the benefit of the family and medical leave law. But what I want to say, I will stay the course. I want you to stay the course.

{"id": 4592, "text": "Now, the drug companies have been saying that even under your plan, which would allow Medicare to buy drugs in bulk, it would decrease the revenue stream to the point where research and development would be stifled. I mean, would you look at the profits they have been making in the last few years. No, you know, they said that over and over and over again. American drug companies charge American citizens far more money for the same pharmaceuticals than they charge Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, anyone else. They say they do it because we bear the full cost of the research and development cost, and they cannot put it off on any of the others because the Government controls the prices. That is what they say. So I think if that is true, then the United States and its people have been awfully good to our drug companies. They have been willing to pay higher prices for drugs made in America than people in other countries do, and I think they owe it to the seniors to get off this high horse and stop trying to beat this attempt to extend medical coverage to seniors for prescription drugs. People that live on fixed incomes ought to be able to get the benefit of discounts you get when you buy in bulk. A lot of these drugs they have long since recovered the research and developments cost, long since. And I just think it is wrong for our people either not to be able to get them at all or to pay so much more than others do. And this is one way to sort of split the difference between their position that they need higher profits to invest in research and development and the very low cost that they can get if they happen to live close enough to the Canadian border to cross it. So I would like to see Medicare cover prescription drugs on a voluntary basis so our seniors can get discount prices. The ideas that have been floated in the Senate, which ostensibly are voucher systems, would you agree with that type of system to pay for prescription drugs? Well, it would not be as effective as the proposal we have made because it would be more difficult to get the benefit of discounts. And therefore, over a few years it would be harder to keep the premiums down. But as I said, I would like to see the Members of Congress in both parties engage with us on this.

I do not think there is any doubt that the answer to those questions is that in the worst public health crisis of the last 100 years, we need Joe Biden as our president. Now, let me say a word about the economy. Let me be blunt, tell you the way it is. And that is that the working class of this country is in more desperation today than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic. They have lost their incomes. They have lost their health insurance. They have depleted their life savings. They cannot afford to pay their rent or their mortgages. And in too many cases, in the richest country on Earth, they cannot afford to put food on the table for their kids. Today, the percentage of Americans who lack employment is at the highest level in 45 years, while tens of millions of Americans who do have jobs are often working part-time for starvation wages. And as bad as the economy is in general, it is far worse for the African American and Latino communities. During this pandemic, nearly 60% of Latino families and 55% of African-American families have either experienced a job loss or a pay cut. Meanwhile, and it is important to make this point because it is not made often enough, while the working class of this country is being devastated as a result of the pandemic, not everybody in America is hurting.

Already in just a year and a half, through the increase of the earned-income tax credit, 15 million working parents have been able to get lower income taxes to encourage them to stay in the work force and to be good parents without having to go on welfare. We have made it easier for millions and millions of young people to get college loans by making those loans available with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment schedules. We have established more job training and school-to-work apprenticeships to help young people who are not going to college find and keep good jobs. We have sought tax incentives and grant money to stimulate economies in needy areas, through things like our empowerment zones and enterprise communities and new community development banks, the reform of the Community Reinvestment Act and making low income housing credits permanent. Some of these achievements, to be sure, have come easier than others.

It means small businesses will no longer provide coverage for their employees because the Government will. And people would be moved from private insurance to Government insurance. You see, when the Government writes the checks, the Government starts making the rules.

When I ran for President 4 years ago, I promised to keep that commitment and improve Medicare by adding prescription drug coverage. I kept my word. Seniors are now getting discounts on medicine with drug discount cards. Low-income seniors are getting $600 of help this year and $600 of help next year to help them afford prescription drugs. And beginning in 2006, all seniors will be able to get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. And we will keep the promise of Social Security for our seniors, and as we do so, we will strengthen Social Security for generations to come.

I was quite interested recently when the General Secretary, meeting with the leaders of your Orthodox Church, lessened some of the restrictions that government had imposed on the practice of that religion. Well, I have wondered if a further expansion of that-you see, our country came into being because people were being denied, in other countries, the right to worship God as they saw fit.

Well, I have just wondered if there is not a field there in your own country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice religion in the ways they chose.

Why do not we have a national ENTITY bill? What would an ENTITY bill do? Well, I do not know, I am asking you. Well, if you are asking me, we are doing a good job on research. We are spending far more per victim on ENTITY research than we are on heart disease or cancer, which are far greater killers. We have got to do more in the education front on ENTITY. When I talked to the researchers at National Institutes of Health, I think they feel that they could use more money, but I do not think they feel a shortage of research funds is what is important. We are trying to speed ENTITY research drugs to market even though some are going to accuse us of getting them there before they have been fully tested. I think maybe we need to do more in terms of education. And that is one reason I'd like to see Magic Johnson on our National ENTITY Commission, if he feels that it is something he is interested in doing. The reason I asked you is because I thought maybe there was some ENTITY bill I am not familiar with.

I think they are not telling the truth. I think that in the first place, I see the world as one great big market. And I think every time we export, we are doing something good. So, when I go like the other day to an EC meeting in The Hague and try to expand our agricultural sales, that are very important in Missouri; try to expand those around the world, I think that is in the American interest. Secondly, I think world peace is in the interest of your kids and mine and our grandchildren. And I am going to continue to work on that. Thirdly, I have a good domestic agenda program. But my problem is the liberal Democrats that control both Houses of the Congress want to try it some other way. The crime bill, the transportation bill, and these other growth measures that I have talked about. In foreign affairs, when we went to win a war I did not have to ask the leadership of the Democratic Congress whether it is okay. Hey, is it all right if I move this division there? Is it okay if we send Schwarzkopf here or there? I did not have to do that. It is different on domestic affairs. You are always fighting some tired, in my view, tired, old ideas up there. Speaking of tired, old ideas, do you detect a swing in voters' mood in the country? Well, in the first place, the Buddy Roemer was a terrible blow because it gave rise to a very tough choice in Louisiana. I could not be silent in the face of a man who is an ex-Nazi, who is a bigot, whose past is full of racism. So, I have spoken out on that. And the only worry I have got on that one is will that help Duke or hurt him, because Louisianians are proud. They do not like people coming in from outside telling them what to do.

Many people think that for major domestic reforms like health care, that for it to be durable and successful you need bipartisan support. Do you believe that?

Well, let us focus first of all on health care, and I will talk about energy as well. My general principle is I always want bipartisan support. Whether I get bipartisan support or not for any given proposal isn'talways up to me, it has to do with the short-term political calculus and thetactics that the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans determine. WhatI do have control over is accepting bipartisan ideas, bipartisan policies. So on health care, for example, there are already a bunch of liberals who are disappointed because I did not propose a single payer plan. What I have said is that without having, despite what is been advertised, a government takeover of health care, that is not what we are we have called for. We have said that if you have got a plan in the private sector that you are happy with, you have got a doctor you are happy with, you keep that person. We are not going to be messing with that. What I have said is setting up a public option that would compete with the private sector, but, if it was offering a better product, would give a additional choice to consumers, that is going to keep insurance companies honest.

If they are going to sustain the growth that they have had over the last 20 years, if they hope to match the growth levels that they have seen, they have got to open up their markets, they have got to provide protection for patents and intellectual property, they have got to end the subsidies to these state-owned enterprises. So there are a lot of things that they are going to have to do. And if they see that all their neighbors are operating at a high level, then I am confident that ultimately they will adapt to the rules that we have set up as opposed to us adapting or being locked out of these markets because they have set rules that advantage the old style of doing business. Seems to me a little bit like you are betting on the come on this one, right?

Right now, actually, the most recent intervention they did in the markets probably propped up the RMB - their currency. But it scared the bejesus out of everybody. Well, it did, and I think it also concerned President Xi, recognizing that you cannot - in an interconnected global economy - continue to operate at the scale they are operating with old rules that maybe applied when they were a backwater economy.

So part of what is happened when it comes to wages as opposed to job creation is that as a consequence of globalization but also because of automation and technology, increasingly workers have had less leverage. And so even if the jobs are being created, companies do not feel obliged to give people raises as demand for their products go up. They can say to themselves, You know what, we will just invest in more automation instead of hiring more workers, or if we do hire more workers, we will tell them,'This is how much we can afford, and if you want more, then we know that there is a bunch of other people that we can get.' And we have to make sure that the middle class and workers have more leverage and the laws that we set up in this country can make a difference. And here is what we know. There are countries like Germany where wages typically are higher but they are still competitive, and it has to do with the arrangements they make and how big of the pie that is growing goes to middle-class families and workers as opposed to just shareholders and financial firms. Last time we talked, I pushed you a little bit on how jobs inevitably when trade agreements get done, they inevitably go away, and nobody who is in favor of free trade ever says, You know what, you are going to lose some jobs, get used to it.

Yeah, they talking to you on this one? we have a difference. What I have said to them is that companies in the United States who are pursuing a low-wage strategy and have decided that the way for us to compete and make a profit is to find the lowest wages possible, they have already left.

My friends, we need an economy that works for all of us, not just the few. And it is not just in recent years, it is not just over the last four years. Here is something else that we do not talk about. Over the last 45 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in America, but sadly, that redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. Since 1990, while the top 1% saw their wealth go up by $22 trillion, you got that? Top 1% saw their wealth increase by $22 trillion, the bottom half of America saw their wealth actually go down.

They are sick and tired of seeing CEOs now make 300 times more than their average employees. While they give themselves huge bonuses, they cut back on their health care benefits of their workers. The American people are sick and tired of that corporate greed. They are sick and tired all of us paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

In the event that such a condition develops, it becomes pertinent to examine what can be done by our own country, in cooperation with others, further to rid ourselves and the rest of the world of the menace and burden of competitive armaments and more effectively insure the settlement of differences between nations, not by a recourse to arms, but by a recourse to reason; not by action leading to war, but by action leading to justice.

But these proposals for arbitration and courts are not put forward by those who are well informed with the idea that they could be relied upon as an adequate means for entirely preventing war. They are rather a method of securing adjustment of claims and differences, and for the enforcement of treaties, when the usual channels of diplomatic negotiation fail to resolve the difficulty.

Undoubtedly something might be accomplished in this direction, although a very large body of such law consists in undertaking to establish rules of warfare and determining the rights of neutrals.

I have got great confidence in what America stands for. I have said to our country and to the world many times that in order for there to be peace, there must be freedom. And I believe that a free Palestinian Authority and a free Palestinian people will yield to peace in that part of the world. Therefore, we are striving toward the development of such a state. And until people begin to see, however, the results of that vision, people will be skeptical. And the only thing I can do is to continue to speak out as clearly as I can about the values which motivate our foreign policy and motivate me personally and work hard to achieve results, tangible results. And when people see results, when the people see that the Iraqi people are more free and that their economy begins to develop, when people see that the Iraqi people have control of their own oil for the benefit of the Iraqi people, then some of the suspicions will be turned aside.

Keep in mind, we went from a $1 to a $4 trillion national debt-that is the annual deficits added up-in only 12 years, from 1980 to 1992. And we need to get that deficit down to zero as quickly as we can without collapsing the economy. You cannot do it overnight, but we have to do it over a period of years. And as we do it, that is less money we have to spend on interest on the debt and more money we can invest in creating jobs, business incentives, and education and training and new technologies, and building roads and bridges and airports and things that make a country rich and competitive in this world. So even though we are getting a break on the deficit, we are getting a break on the deficit because the financial markets are responding to our efforts to bring the deficit down.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlarryking4", "title": "Interview With Larry King", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-larry-king-4", "publication_date": "20-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I think that I have said my piece on this matter. We are going to continue negotiations. We think that it is early in the process, but we think we can make some progress. What the Israelis say is that they have managed to persuade you at least to concentrate on Iran and to give what is --behind the scenes they are calling a bit of an ultimatum to the Iranians, that by the end of this year there must be some real progress. Well, the only thing I'd correct on that is I do not think the Israelis needed to convince me of that, since I have been talking about it for the last 2 years. What I have said is that it is in the world's interests for Iran to set aside ambitions for a nuclear weapon, but that the best way to accomplish that is through tough, direct diplomacy. Now--and what I was very clear about was that although I do not want to put artificial time tables on that process, we do want to make sure that by the end of this year we have actually seen a serious process move forward, and I think that we can measure whether or not the Iranians are serious. My personal view is that the Islamic state of Iran has the potential to be a extraordinarily powerful and prosperous country. They are more likely to achieve that in the absence of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region, not just responses from Israel, by the way, but potentially other states in the region--and that if what is preventing them from seeing that reality is 30 years of loggerheads between Iran and the United States, then this may be an opportunity for us to open the door and see if they walk through.

It may be hard to remember now, the great hopes with which their revolution was first greeted. The hated dictator Anastasio Somoza had been toppled, and the world looked forward to a bright future for Nicaragua. Little did we think then that the future the Sandinistas were planning for Nicaragua would be darker than anything that suffering country had ever before experienced. The Sandinistas spelled out their plans for subversion and aggression throughout Central America in the secret, but now notorious, 72-Hour Document, and it was not long before they started carrying them out. Arms shipments began flowing to the Communist guerrillas throughout Latin America-in El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, and other countries. closing churches and extinguishing the free press . The ranks of political prisoners swelled into the thousands, and beatings, torture, and official murder became the order of the day. Meanwhile, the Sandinistas began a campaign of slaughter against the peaceful Miskito Indians. One in every ten Nicaraguans is now a refugee-leaving home, family, and friends to escape the oppression inside that country. If the Sandinistas get their way, the torment of that sad country will soon spread throughout the entire region, engulfing the young democracies that surround Nicaragua. As I said in New York a few months ago, the democratic aspirations of millions in Central America now hang in the balance. The elected leaders of neighboring Central American countries know that until democracy comes to Nicaragua their own democracies will never be safe. free, fair, and regularly scheduled elections in Nicaragua, the establishment of a genuinely democratic system and all the freedoms such a system depends on and encourages-freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of worship. This is what the Nicaraguan freedom fighters are fighting for, and this is why we must support them. We have worked in many ways to counter the spread of communism in Central America and those nations I have mentioned that are threatened by Nicaragua. We have instituted economic assistance to the region, military assistance to threatened democracies, and, together with our Central American allies, vigorous efforts to negotiate a peaceful and democratic outcome.

I proposed the hiring of 825 new Federal agents and staff, 1,600 new prosecutors and staff, and an additional $1 billion for Federal prison construction.

For example, to interdict arms shipments to Hezbollah by Iran, the problem is not that we do not have the authority to do it. The problem is not that we and Israelis want to stop that from happening, or Gulf allies want to stop that from happening. We have to have better intelligence. We have to have better interdiction capabilities. And so, you know, the issue here is not how much we spend or how hard we try; the issue is are we doing it the right way? Are we being smart about it? I have said, for example, that the Gulf countries, their combined defense spending is eight times Iran's. So the issue is not even if Iran is putting in additional dollars as a consequence of sanctions relief and an improved economy, Iran will continue to be outspent. It is that under any scenario our problems are greatly magnified if in fact Iran also has a nuclear weapon.

Yeah, but - but - but - but ENTITY, that is not accurate because the notion that somehow Iran is untethered ignores the fact that, for example, we will still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights. There is no logic to the notion that somehow we will let up on trying to prevent activities that Iran may engage in that would be contrary to our national security interests. So show me the alternative vision from what the critics have laid out, then.

I think we need to reform the health care system. The people who talk about spending cuts first are basically saying this. We are cutting defense sharply and about all we can. I am concerned that we should not do more. We have cut it quite deeply. For example, that means every dollar we increase Head Start, every dollar we increase education and training for workers that have been displaced by defense plants closing down, every dollar we put into new technologies for defense conversion-those are the three areas where we basically have increased-we have to cut in veterans affairs, in agriculture, in all these other areas. Already we have a budget that will reduce the Federal work force by over 100,000 people in the next 5 years, and there will be more cuts coming to that, so that is flat. The only thing that is increasing in this budget are the so-called entitlements, and that is basically Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security cost of living. We have restrained Federal pay increases and Federal pension increases below where they have been under the previous administrations. They are getting some cost of living, but less than they ordinarily would, and I called for a freeze in the first year. So the real growth is in Medicare and Medicaid, in the health care programs. If you put a lid on them now without reforming the health care system, you must do one of two things that I think are not good. One is to charge middle class elderly people more for their Medicare and much more if you are going to make them pay it all. Or the second is to not charge them any more, just limit how much the Federal Government pays, and force the doctors and hospitals to shift all the costs to the private sector, which would raise the health insurance premiums of every newspaper on this telephone. That is what is been going on for years. I do not dispute those who say if you want to take the deficit from where I take it to down to zero, you have to deal with entitlements.

Two, the Russians are conducting military operations in -- in the Middle East for the first time since World War II -- bombing the people that we are supporting. So let me ask you this question. When I came into office, Ukraine was governed by a corrupt ruler who was a stooge of Mr. Putin. Syria was Russia's only ally in the region. And today, rather than being able to count on their support and maintain the base they had in Syria, which they have had for a long time, Mr. Putin now is devoting his own troops, his own military, just to barely hold together by a thread his sole ally. He is challenging your leadership, ENTITY. He is challenging your leadership. Well, ENTITY, I have got to tell you, if -- if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in, in order to prop up your only ally is leadership, then we have got a different definition of leadership. My definition of leadership would be leading on climate change, an international accord that potentially we will get in Paris. My definition of leadership is mobilizing the entire world community to make sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. And with respect to the Middle East, we have got a 60-country coalition that is not suddenly lining up around Russia's strategy. To the contrary, they are arguing that, in fact, that strategy will not work. My point is -- was not that he was leading; my point is that he was challenging your leadership. And he has very much involved himself in the situation. Can you imagine anything happening in Syria of any significance at all without the Russians now being involved in it and having a part of it? Keep in mind that, for the last five years, the Russians have provided arms, provided financing, as have the Iranians, as has Hezbollah. But they have not been bombing, and they have not had troops on the ground. And the fact that they had to do this is not an indication of strength. You do not think that Mr. Putin would have preferred having Mr. Assad be able to solve this problem without him having to send a bunch of pilots and money that they do not have?

I say if we really want to help small business, let us give them relief from taxation, regulation, and litigation. Now, let me mention just another subject the New Jerseyans know about, and that is auto insurance. At the root of many of our problems is a legal system that is out of control. I want to do something about these crazy lawsuits. Governor Clinton and the trial lawyers do not want to do anything about it. You know, 15 percent of American companies report that they have laid off workers because of high premiums from liability insurance. Experts estimate that over $20 billion of our health care costs come from doctors and nurses doing unnecessary tests because they are afraid that a lawyer is going to sue them, and auto insurance costs continue to rise, as New Jerseyans know better than almost anyone. Thousands of people enter frivolous lawsuits for pain and suffering. But the lion's share of the benefits goes not to people who are injured but to the trial lawyers. I say we must reform our malpractice laws and our product liability laws. When Congress comes back, I am going to introduce a new proposal to allow all Americans to opt out of the so-called pain and suffering standard. You know, this reform allows States to go even further than New Jersey's landmark insurance reforms. But anyway, this proposal will save American drivers 20 to 30 billion dollars in insurance premiums every year. So these are part of our Agenda for American Renewal.

And as I said on Thursday night, my team and I are prepared to work with the Congress; to negotiate in good faith with the leadership; to work day and night, if that is what it takes, to meet budget targets; and to produce a budget on time. I have spoken about priorities; let me just share with you briefly what those priorities are. First, let us make sure that America remains the greatest and the most productive nation on the face of the Earth. We should begin to invest now in ways that will make America more competitive in the future. more funds for basic research; a permanent tax credit for R&D, for research and development; a strengthened role for science and technology in our national policy deliberations. When I was Vice ENTITY, I chaired a task force on regulatory relief, which was intended to help survey the wilderness of government regulation to determine which rules were hurting private productive activity and which were helping. And we did a lot of good early on. We got rid of some needless regulation, and still protecting the safety in the workplace and things of that important nature. But the work of this task force will continue, and its mission expanded, however. The Vice President, Dan Quayle, will head this new task force on competitiveness to explore a range of issues, from regulatory reform to training for the work force of the future. a package of bills to improve education in America. Chance favors only the prepared mind. Our children deserve every break that we can give them because they do represent our future. And so, for America to be prepared for the future, our children must be educated for the future. And part of our education effort must be in the area of drugs. Education is still our best means of prevention. And we will fight drugs on all fronts, not only education but treatment, interdiction, and law enforcement. But for those who are already hooked on drugs, we have got to expand treatment. For those who are dealing drugs, I want them to know how serious we are about stopping them. And I have asked for and will insist on tougher penalties. And, yes, that does include the death penalty for those drug kingpins.

And we are training the next generation of scientists and engineers who are going to unlock new technologies to carry us forward. One of the great challenges they will face and that your generation will face is the fuel cycle itself in producing nuclear energy. The very process that gives us nuclear energy can also put nations and terrorists within the reach of nuclear weapons. We simply cannot go on accumulating huge amounts of the very material, like separated plutonium, that we are trying to keep away from terrorists. And that is why we are creating new fuel banks to help countries realize the energy they seek without increasing the nuclear dangers that we fear. That is why I have called for a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation. We need an international commitment to unlocking the fuel cycle of the future. In the United States we are investing in the research and development of new fuel cycles so that dangerous materials cannot be stolen or diverted. And today I urge nations to join us in seeking a future where we harness the awesome power of the atom to build and not to destroy. In this sense, we see how the efforts I have described today reinforce each other. When we enhance nuclear security, we are in a stronger position to harness safe, clean nuclear energy. When we develop new, safer approaches to nuclear energy, we reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism and proliferation. When nations, including my own, fulfill our responsibilities, it strengthens our ability to ensure that other nations fulfill their responsibilities. And step by step, we come closer to the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons. I know that there are those who deride our vision. There are those who say ours is an impossible goal that will be forever out of reach. But to anyone who doubts the great progress that is possible, I tell them, come to Korea. Come to this country, which rose from the ashes of war----a country that rose from the ashes of war, turning rubble into gleaming cities.

But I think any Israeli leader would have to see that, and I think in the end, any American government will come back to a concern for it, if for no other reason than a desire to have stability in the region. Let me turn you quickly to the economy. The Republicans are talking about a retroactive tax cut. You have got an economic statement tomorrow. Are the factors there, is the evidence there strong enough that there is a downturn going on and we need this retroactive tax cut? Well, first of all, the blue chip forecast, I think, is for 2.6 percent growth, which is enough growth to keep the unemployment rate at about 4 percent. And that really does not surprise me. When I saw the initial estimates, which were about 3.4 percent, I thought they were a tad high because we have been growing for a couple of years at nearly 5 percent, which is, for an advanced economy of our size, it is just virtually unprecedented. You simply could not sustain it at that rate. On the other hand, there is been a fairly sharp drop in stock values, and that takes a lot of wealth out of the economy, and eventually, that backs down into lower consumption and orders and things like that. So you see, for example, real problems in the steel industry today at a time when steel imports are also dropping. So it is not like the '97 crisis where-the crisis in Asia and Russia led people to try to flood the market in America with bargain basement prices. Here, you have got an overall problem. So I think I have always believed that a tax cut should be part of the next budget. I thought it should have been part of the last budget. It can be a little bigger than the one that I proposed, because the surplus has been written up some-the estimated surplus. Although I think it is very important that they go back and subtract from the estimated surplus the 10-year costs of the budget we just adopted, because it is the best education budget, for example, that we have had in my 8 years.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

There is no more important critical piece of unfinished business than our need to ensure that every American, young and old, has adequate, affordable health care. Today I want to again urge the Congress to step up to this challenge by making the passage of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights and the provision of a voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit top priorities when they return to Washington. The more than 190 million Americans who use managed care or other insurance plans have waited too long for a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. They deserve the right to see a specialist, to emergency room care wherever and whenever they need it, and the right to hold health care plans accountable for harmful decisions. Last year, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the House passed a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that provides the right protections all Americans need and deserve. But more than 6 months later, the bill is still languishing in Congress. Despite their pledge to complete a real bill, the Republican majority has not only delayed action, it is actually considering legislation that would leave tens of millions of Americans without Federal protections. We need a strong bill that protects all Americans and all plans, not one that provides more cover for the special interests than real coverage for American patients. Congress also has an obligation to strengthen Medicare and modernize it, with a voluntary, affordable prescription drug benefit. No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five older Americans still lack affordable and dependable prescription drug coverage. Just this week we saw further evidence of the unacceptable burden the growing cost of prescription drugs places on senior Americans. According to a report by the nonprofit group, Families USA, the price of prescription drugs most often used by seniors has risen at double the rate of inflation for 6 years running, a burden that falls hardest on seniors who lack drug coverage because they simply do not receive the price discounts most insurers negotiate. Seniors and people with disabilities living on fixed incomes simply cannot continue to cope with these kinds of price increases. That is why we must take action to help them, not next year or the year after that but this year.

Now, there will only be, depending on-I think there are one or two recounts still going on in the House, so there will be, in effect, a three- or four-vote difference in the House-margin. And they need to decide whether that is going to change their rules any, because individual House Members or even our whole caucus in the minority, no matter how narrow the minority, very often cannot affect a rule. So in the House, debate tends to be cut off much more.

I am not sure it is an intellectual exercise as much as it is reminding myself of why I ran for president and tapping into what I consider to be the innate common sense of the American people. The truth is that most of the big issues that are going to make a difference in the life of this country for the next thirty or forty years are complicated and require tough decisions, but are not rocket science. that we have the most competitive workforce in the world, that we have a better education system, that we are investing in research and development, that we have got world-class infrastructure, that we are reducing our health care costs, and that we are expanding our exports. On issues like immigration, we have a pretty good sense of what is broken in the system and how to fix it. On climate change, it is a daunting task. But we know what releases carbon into the atmosphere, and we have tools right now that would start scaling that back, although we'd still need some big technological breakthrough. So the question is not, Do we have policies that might work? It is, can we mobilize the political will to act? And so, I have been spending a lot of time just thinking about how do I communicate more effectively with the American people? How do I try to bridge some of the divides that are longstanding in our culture? How do I project a sense of confidence in our future at a time when people are feeling anxious? They are more questions of values and emotions and tapping into people's spirit. Have you looked back in history, particularly at the second terms of other presidents, for inspiration? I have said this before, but one of the things that happened in the first term was that we had so many fires going on at the same time that we were focusing on policy and getting it right, which means that we were spending less time communicating with the American people about why we were doing what we were doing and how it tied together with our overarching desire of strengthening our middle class and making the economy work.

And we took the position that we should mend it, not end it, and that is the position that Vice President Gore has steadily defended. I noticed in his third debate that he was the only candidate who would say that he was for affirmative action. And I can tell you, we had long, long discussions about this. He believes strongly in it. And I believe virtually every one of our candidates for the Senate and the House does.

We lost four million jobs before I was sworn in and another four million jobs in three months after I was sworn in, but before any of our economic policies had a chance to take effect. And we have now had nine consecutive quarters, two and a half years, in which the economy's grown. About nine months later, we were creating jobs again.

But it has not made up for the hole that was created in those six, nine, 12 months before my economic policies took effect.

At your news conference you seemed unwilling to accept the idea that this was a rejection, in any way, of your agenda and your policies. Is this defeat a reflection on your leadership? I think that what happened over the course of two years was that we had to take a series of big emergency steps quickly, and most of them in the first six months of my administration. Each of them had a big price tag, and people looked at that and they said, Boy, this feels as if there is a huge expansion of government. Well, it was a huge expansion of government. What I did not effectively, I think, drive home is that we were taking these steps not because of some theory that we wanted to expand government; it was because we had an emergency situation and we wanted to make sure the economy did not go off a cliff.

And I think it is very important that we-except in the most extreme circumstances-maintain some continuity in foreign policy and in our commitments to other countries. But President-elect Bush is in no way, shape, or form bound by the positions I have taken on this Middle East agreement, unless there is some agreement.

Well, I think they will be very interested in stability and peace in the Middle East. Their orientation has been a little more toward, you know, the Gulf, the oil-producing states, honoring our historic commitments to Israel to maintain their qualitative military capacity. But to be fair, the previous Bush administration took a pretty strong line on expanded settlements after the Madrid talks started in the hope that they could help to create the conditions in which the Palestinians and the Israelis could move toward peace. So I think that there may be differences in approach and priorities that the President and the Vice President and Secretary Powell will have to work through. But my guess is that their general direction will be the same, because in the end, what happens is-let us assume-and I am not saying this, because I do not believe this-but listen, even if you had an administration that did not really care about the Palestinian problem on its own merits and said, Well, our real interests are in the geopolitics of the oilproducing states and the problems created by the lack of an agreement with Syria.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

And as the new century dawned, the violent currents swirling beneath the Middle East began to surface. In the Holy Land, the dashed expectations resulting from the collapse of the Camp David peace talks had given way to the second intifada. Palestinian suicide bombers struck with horrific frequency and lethality. They murdered innocent Israelis at a pizza parlor or aboard buses or in the middle of a Passover Seder. Israeli Defense Forces responded with large-scale operations. And in 2001, more than 500 Israelis and Palestinians were killed. Politically, the Palestinian Authority was led by a terrorist who stole from his people and walked away from peace. In Israel, Ariel Sharon was elected to fight terror and pursue a greater Israel policy that allowed for no territorial concessions. Neither side could envision a return to negotiations or the realistic possibility of a two-state solution. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Saddam Hussein had begun his third decade as the dictator of Iraq, a reign that included invading two neighbors, developing and using weapons of mass destruction, attempting to exterminate Marsh Arabs and many Kurds, paying the families of suicide bombers, systematically violating U.N. resolutions, and firing routinely at British and U.S. aircraft patrolling a no-fly zone. Syria continued its occupation of Lebanon, with some 30,000 troops on Lebanese soil. Libya sponsored terror and pursued weapons of mass destruction. And in Iran, the prospect for of reform was fading, the regime's sponsorship of terror continued, and its pursuit of nuclear weapons was largely unchecked. Throughout the region, suffering and stagnation were rampant. The Arab Human Development Report revealed a bleak picture of high unemployment, poor education, high mortality rates for mothers, and almost no investment in technology.
