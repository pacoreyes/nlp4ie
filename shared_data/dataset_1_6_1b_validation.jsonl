And then came September the 11th, 2001, when 19 men from the Middle East carried out the worst attack on the United States since the strike on Pearl Harbor 67 years ago this weekend. In the space of a single morning, 9/11 etched a sharp dividing line in our history. We realized that we are in a struggle with fanatics pledged to our destruction. We saw that conditions of repression and despair on the other side of the world could bring suffering and death to our own streets. With these new realities in mind, America reshaped our approach to the Middle East. We made clear that we will defend our friends, our interests, and our people against any hostile attempt to dominate the Middle East, whether by terror, blackmail, or the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. We have carried out this new strategy by following three overriding principles. First, we took the offense against the terrorists overseas. We are waging a relentless campaign to break up extremist networks and deny them safe havens. As part of that offensive, we pledged to strengthen our partnership with every nation that joins in the fight against terror. We deepened our security cooperation with allies like Jordan and Egypt, and with our friends in the gulf. Saudi Arabia, long a breeding ground for radicalism, has become a determined partner in the fight against terror, killing or capturing hundreds of Al Qaida operatives in the Kingdom. We dramatically expanded counterterrorism ties with partners in North Africa. And we left no doubt that America would stand by our closest ally in the Middle East, the State of Israel. Second, we made clear that hostile regimes must end their support for terror and their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, or face the concerted opposition of the world. This was the approach we took in Iraq. It is true, as I have said many times, that Saddam Hussein was not connected to the 9/11 attacks. But the decision to remove Saddam from power cannot be viewed in isolation from 9/11.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesabanforum", "title": "Remarks at the Saban Forum", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-saban-forum", "publication_date": "05-12-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 5040, "text": "In a world where terrorists armed with box cutters had just killed nearly 3,000 of our people, America had to decide whether we could tolerate a sworn enemy that acted belligerently, that supported terror, and that intelligence agencies around the world believed had weapons of mass destruction. It was clear to me it was clear to members of both political parties and to many leaders around the world that after 9/11, that was a risk we could not afford to take. So we went back to the United Nations Security Council, which unanimously passed Resolution 1441 calling on Saddam Hussein to disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. With this resolution, we offered Saddam Hussein a final chance to comply with the demands of the world. And when he refused to resolve the issue peacefully, we acted with a coalition of nations to protect our people and liberated 25 million Iraqis. When Saddam regimes fell when Saddam's regime fell, we refused to take the easy option and install a friendly strongman in his place. Even though it required enormous sacrifice, we stood by the Iraqi people as they elected their own leaders and built a young democracy. When the violence reached its most dire point, pressure to withdraw reached its height. Yet failure in Iraq would have unleashed chaos, widened the violence, and allowed the terrorists to gain a new safe haven, a fundamental contradiction to our vision for the Middle East. So we adopted a new strategy and deployed more troops to secure the Iraqi people. When the surge met its objective, we began to bring our troops home under the policy of return on success. Yesterday, building on the gains made by the surge, the democratic Government of Iraq approved two agreements with the United States that formalize our diplomatic, economic, and security ties and set a framework for the drawdown of American forces as the fight in Iraq nears its successful end. After 9/11, we also confronted Libya over its weapons of mass destruction. The leader of Libya made a wise choice. In 2003, Colonel Qadhafi announced that he would abandon his weapons of mass destruction program. He concluded that the interests of his people would be best served by improving relations with America, and Libya turned over its nuclear centrifuges and other deadly equipment to the United States. The defeat of Saddam also appears to have changed the calculation of Iran. According to our intelligence community, the regime in Tehran had started a nuclear weapons program in the late 1980s, and they halted a key part of that program in 2003.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesabanforum", "title": "Remarks at the Saban Forum", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-saban-forum", "publication_date": "05-12-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 5041, "text": "America recognized that the most effective way to pursue persuade Iran to remove its nuclear weapons renounce its nuclear weapons ambitions was to have partners at our side, so we supported an international effort led by our allies in Europe. This diplomacy yielded an encouraging result when Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment. Sadly, after the election of President Ahmadi-nejad, Iran reversed course and announced it would begin enriching again. Since then, we have imposed tough sanctions through United Nations resolutions. We and our partners have offered Iran diplomatic and economic incentives to suspend enrichment. We have promised to support a peaceful civilian nuclear program. For the safety of our people and the peace of the world, America will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. Third, America identified the lack of freedom in the Middle East as a principal cause of the threats coming from the region. We concluded that if the region continued on the path it was headed, if another generation grew up with no hope for the future and no outlet to express its views, the Middle East would continue to simmer in resentment and export violence. To stop this from happening, we have resolved to help the region steer itself toward a better course of freedom and dignity and hope. We are engaged in a battle with the extremists that is broader than a military conflict and broader than a law enforcement operation. We are engaged in an ideological struggle. And to advance our security interests and moral interests, America is working to advance freedom and democracy as the great alternatives to repression and terror. As part of this effort, we are pressing nations across the region, including our friends, to trust their people with greater freedom of speech and worship and assembly. We are giving strong support to young democracies. We are standing with reformers and dissidents and human rights activists across the region. Through new efforts like the Middle East peace partnership initiative and the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative, we are supporting the rise of vibrant civil societies. We are also advancing a broader vision that includes economic prosperity, quality health care and education, and women's rights. We have negotiated new free trade agreements in the region, supported Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and proposed a new Middle East free trade area.

Finally, to advance all the principles that I have outlined supporting our friends and pressuring our adversaries and extending freedom America has launched a sustained initiative to help bring peace to the Holy Land.

To earn the trust of Israeli leaders, we made it clear that no Palestinian state would be born of terror, we backed Prime Minister Sharon's courageous withdrawal from Gaza, and we supported his decision to build a security fence, not as a political border but to protect the people from terror. To help the Palestinian people achieve the state they deserve, we insisted on Palestinian leadership that rejects terror and recognizes Israel's right to exist. Now that this leadership has emerged, we are strongly supporting its efforts to build institutions of a vibrant democratic state. With good advice from leaders like former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Generals Jones, Dayton, Fraser, and Selva, the Palestinians are making progress toward capable security forces, a functioning legal system, Government Ministries that deliver services without corruption, and a market economy. In all our efforts to promote a two-state solution, we have included Arab leaders from across the region, because we fully understand that their support will be essential for the creation of a state and lasting peace. Last fall at Annapolis, Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab leaders came together at an historic summit. President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert agreed to launch direct negotiations on a peace agreement. Nations around the globe, including many in the Arab world, pledged to support them.

On this issue, and on our overall approach to the Middle East these past 8 years, America has been ambitious in vision, we have been bold in action, and we have been firm in purpose. Our aim was to help a troubled region take the difficult first steps on the long journey to freedom and prosperity and hope. Some have called this idealistic, and no doubt it is. Yet it is the only practical way to help the people of the Middle East realize the dignity and justice they deserve. And it is the only practical way to protect the United States of America in the long term. As with any large undertaking, these efforts have not always gone according to plan, and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes. For example, the fight in Iraq has been longer and more costly than expected. The reluctance of entrenched regimes to open their political systems has been disappointing. Despite these frustrations and disappointments, the Middle East in 2008 is a freer, more hopeful, and more promising place than it was in 2001. For the first time in nearly three decades, the people of Lebanon are free from Syria's military occupation. Libya's nuclear weapons equipment is locked away in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Places like the UAE and Bahrain are emerging as centers of commerce. The region the regime in Iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before. Terrorist organizations like Al Qaida have failed decisively in their attempts to take over nations; they are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the Arab world. Iraq has gone from an enemy of America to a friend of America, from sponsoring terror to fighting terror, and from a brutal dictatorship to a multireligious, multiethnic constitutional democracy. Instead of the Iraq we would see if a Saddam Hussein were in power an aggressive regime vastly enriched by oil, defying the United Nations, bullying its Arab neighbors, threatening Israel, and pursuing a nuclear arms race with Iran we see an Iraq emerging peacefully with its neighbors, welcoming Arab ambassadors back to Baghdad, and showing the Middle East a powerful example of a moderate, prosperous, free nation.

Several nations have opened up private universities, and Internet use has risen sharply. Across the region, conversations about freedom and reform are growing louder. Expectations about government responsiveness are rising, and people are defying the condescending view that the culture of the Middle East is unfit for freedom. Iran and Syria continue to sponsor terror. Iran's uranium enrichment remains a major threat to peace. Many in the region still live under oppression. Yet the changes of the past 8 years herald the beginning of something historic and new. At long last, the Middle East is closing a chapter of darkness and fear and opening a new one written in the language of possibility and hope. For the first time in generations, the region represents something more than a set of problems to be solved or the site of energy resources to be developed. A free and peaceful Middle East will represent a source of promise and home of opportunity and a vital contributor to the prosperity of the world. Those who ask what this future will look like need only look around. We see the new story of the Middle East in Iraqis waving ink-stained fingers, with Lebanese taking to streets in the Cedar Revolution. We see it in women taking their seats in elected Parliaments and bloggers telling the world their dreams. We see it in the skyscrapers rising above Abu Dhabi and liv-ing and thriving Middle Eastern businesses that are now connected to the global economy. We see it in a Saudi king sponsoring an interfaith dialogue, Palestinian reformers fighting corruption and terror, and Israelis who love their ancient land, but want to live in peace. These are striking images, and they do point the way to a brighter future.

I have learned a lot in this first 6 months. When I got to Washington and sought advice, someone said, Just act like you are a president and treat Congress like the Georgia Legislature. Very quickly I realized that the Congress was treating me like I was still Governor of Georgia, but now, with the help of a great number of friends in the Congress, we have formed a kind of relationship that ought to exist between the White House and our Nation's Capitol. I think there is a genuine sense of sharing of responsibility and the burden of government, and you are a part of that circle of leaders in the State legislature and the Governors' offices, who join in with the president, the Congress, and others in making sure that our government works.

Our Southern States have a proud tradition of local, independent government, and now you are the heirs of that tradition. But we in the South have also felt, perhaps more directly than many others, some of the rapid changes that have taken place in this modern age. More and more our own lives are shaped by events in other cities, decisions in other States, tensions in other parts of the world.

We have openly and publicly addressed these and other many difficult and controversial issues--some of which had been either skirted or postponed in the past. As I pointed out in a recent press conference, a period of debate, disagreement, probing was inevitable. Our goal has not been to reach easy or transient agreements, but to find solutions that are meaningful, balanced, and lasting. Now, a president has a responsibility to present to the people of this Nation reports and summations of complex and important matters. I feel more secure as president making decisions if I know that either the most difficult, the most complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by you and understood and debated by the Congress. In the past I think our Nation's leaders have been guilty of making decisions in secret. And even when the decision turns out to be the fight one, it makes the president, the Secretary of State speak with a weak voice when they speak alone. Today, I want to discuss a vitally important aspect of our foreign relations, the one that may most directly shape the chances for peace for us and for our children. I would like to spell out my view of what we have done and where we are going in our relations with the Soviet Union and to reaffirm the basic principles of our national policy. I do not have any apology for talking about foreign affairs at a southern legislative conference, because foreign affairs and those difficult decisions ought never to be made with a concept that we can abandon common sense and the sound judgment and the constructive influence of the American people. For decades, the central problems of our foreign policy revolved around antagonism between two coalitions, one headed by the United States and the other headed by the Soviet Union. Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with the Soviet Union. This competition is still critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war. But however important this relationship of military balance, it cannot be our sole preoccupation to the exclusion of other world issues which also concern us both.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentscharlestonsouthcarolinaremarksthe31stannualmeetingthesouthernlegislative", "title": "Charleston, South Carolina Remarks at the 31st Annual Meeting of the Southern Legislative Conference.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/charleston-south-carolina-remarks-the-31st-annual-meeting-the-southern-legislative", "publication_date": "21-07-1977", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

As two industrial giants, we face long-term, worldwide energy crises. Whatever our political differences, both of us are compelled to begin conserving world energy and developing alternatives to oil and gas. Despite deep and continuing differences in world outlook, both of us should accept the new responsibilities imposed on us by the changing nature of international relations. Europe and Japan rose from the rubble of war to become great economic powers. Communist parties and governments have become more widespread and more varied and, I might say, more independent from one another. Newly independent nations emerged into what has now become known as the Third World. Their role in world affairs is becoming increasingly significant. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have learned that our countries and our people, in spite of great resources, are not all-powerful. We have learned that this world, no matter how technology has shrunk distances, is nevertheless too large and too varied to come under the sway of either one or two super powers. And what is perhaps more important of all, we have, for our part, learned, all of us, this fact, these facts in a spirit not of increasing resignation, but of increasing maturity. I mention these familiar changes with which you are familiar because I think that to understand today's Soviet-American relationship, we must place it in perspective, both historically and in terms of the overall global scene. The whole history of Soviet-American relations teaches us that we will be misled if we base our long-range policies on the mood of the moment, whether that mood be euphoric or grim. All of us can remember times when relations seemed especially dangerous and other times when they seemed especially bright. We have crossed those peaks and valleys before. And we can see that, on balance, the trend in the last third of a century has been positive.

As we negotiate with the Soviet Union, we will be guided by a vision of a gentler, freer, and more bountiful world. But we will have no illusions about the nature of the world as it really is. The basis for complete mutual trust between us does not yet exist. Therefore, the agreements that we reach must be anchored on each side in enlightened self-interest-what is best for us, what is best for the Soviet Union. That is why we search for areas of agreement where our real interests and those of the Soviets coincide. We want to see the Soviets further engaged in the growing pattern of international activities designed to deal with human problems--not only because they can be of real help but because we both should be seeking for a greater stake in the creation of a constructive and peaceful world order.

At the same time, we were beginning to regain our sense of confidence and our purpose and unity as a nation. In this situation, I decided that it was time for honest discussions about international issues with the American people.

We have urged a complete end to all nuclear tests, and these negotiations are now underway. Agreement here could be a milestone in U.S.-Soviet relations. We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked France, Britain, and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives. We have undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We have encouraged the Soviets to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere.

We and our allies are negotiating together with the Soviet Union and their allies in the Warsaw Pact nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe.

We are seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger. In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on Vladivostok accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists. The Vladivostok negotiations of 1974 left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation.

If these threats can be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be no doubt that the United States can and will do what it must to protect our security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture. Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation. But none of these proposals that I have outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well. When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I am not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, Soviet and American, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our two countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we will also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life. We have made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the Soviet side about SALT and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the Soviets are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides.

Part of the Soviet Union leaders' current attitude may be due to their apparent-and incorrect--belief that our concern for human rights is aimed specifically at them or is an attack on their vital interests. We stand on what we have said on the subject of human rights. the positive and sincere expression of our deepest beliefs as a people. It is addressed not to any particular people or area of the world, but to all countries equally, yes, including our own country. And it is specifically not designed to heat up the arms race or bring back the cold war. On the contrary, I believe that an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation is far more conducive to an increased respect for human rights than an atmosphere of belligerence or hatred or warlike confrontation. The experience of our own country this last century has proved this over and over again. We have no illusions that the process will be quick or that change will come easily. But we are confident that if we do not abandon the struggle, the cause of personal freedom and human dignity will be enhanced in all nations of the world. We are going to do that. In the past 6 months we have made clear our determination--both to give voice to Americans' fundamental beliefs and to obtain lasting solutions to East-West differences. If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our choice. We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship will evolve in a more constructive direction. But there are things which give me hope, and in conclusion I would like to mention them very briefly.

I first want to say it is a treat to see Mr. and Mrs. Allbaugh, from the great State of Oklahoma; and his brother; most importantly, Diane and Taylor. Of course, you would not have missed it. When I was a Governor, Joe and I used to travel a lot together, and a lot of times people would come up and say, Is he your bodyguard? And that is the kind of man he is, and that is the kind of man I wanted to run FEMA. When the worst happens anywhere in America, I can assure you folks will be confident when Joe Allbaugh arrives on the scene. 54 in the morning, an earthquake rocked the State of Washington, injuring hundreds of people and causing billion dollars of property damage. 30 that night, Joe Allbaugh was on the scene ready to assist people in need. That is the kind of man he is. I could not have made it to Washington without him. And I cannot tell you how honored I am that he has come to Washington to serve his country. more than 2,000 dedicated employees all across America; 4,000 standby employees, ready if needed; an ethic of professionalism; and a willingness to work with State and local officials to help people in need. As Governor, I worked with FEMA officials. Joe and I have great respect for the outgoing Director, James Lee Witt, and for the Acting Director, John Magaw. A lot of change is needed in Washington, but in this Agency the standards are already high. Every year, many thousands of Americans live through floods and hurricanes and fires. They know from personal experience that FEMA is an example of the Federal Government at its best. And I will tell you from personal experience that FEMA has a new Director that speaks to America at its best. When he acts, he will have my full confidence. When he speaks, it will inspire confidence in others. This Agency is in strong and steady hands. Joe will be at the White House many times in the next few years. In the nature of his job, they will not always be the happiest of times. But Joe will help Americans deal with the worst in the best, most compassionate way possible.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheswearingceremonyforjoemallbaughdirectorthefederalemergencymanagement", "title": "Remarks at the Swearing-In Ceremony for Joe M.

Some of you know my household is filled with powerful, accomplished women. I want to thank Marcia and Duffy for that wonderful, heartfelt introduction and for their extraordinary leadership. Most of all, I want to recognize tonight's honorees, the women and men there is some men in the group who endured insults and beatings and risked their lives 50 years ago because they believed in a different future for their daughters and for their sons. The Freedom Riders had faith that America could still be perfected. And as has been noted, it is only because they did that I am able to stand here as President of the United States of America. Which is why, when I had a chance to see them backstage, I gave them all a kiss and a hug. And I told them that even though I was in diapers at the time, I knew something important was going on. What a remarkable group of people, and how blessed we are to have them here, sharing their stories and continuing to inspire us in so many ways. We are truly grateful to you. Being here tonight reminds us that history is not always made in fact, often is not made by generals or presidents or politicians. Change happens when a group of students and activists decide to ride a bus down South, knowing full well the dangers that lie ahead. Change happens when a group of legal secretaries decides that the world needs more women attorneys, and they start an organization to fight for people like them. I do not want to be paid less than that man who is doing the exact same job over there. I want to be paid the same. Change depends on persistence, and change depends on determination. That is how change happened on August 4, 1961. That is how change will happen today, especially when it comes to securing equal rights and equal opportunities for women. Now, the last time I spoke here was in 2005. I was brand new to Washington. Some of you still could not pronounce my name. And when I was thinking about what to say to this group, I was not just thinking about the legal cases you have helped to win or the milestones that you have helped to reach.

I want them to go out into a world where there is no limit to how big they can dream, how high they can reach. And being here with all of you gives me hope and makes me determined, because although this journey is far from over, today our daughters live in a world that is fairer and more equal than it was 6 years ago, a world where more doors are open to them than ever before. Today, for the first time in history, our daughters can see not one, not two, but three women sitting on the bench of the highest court in the land. They can come to the White House and see that the top four lawyers on my staff some of the sharpest legal minds I have ever come across are women. They can read about the extraordinary leadership of a woman in the House of Representatives who went by the title Madam Speaker. They can turn on the news and see that one of the most formidable Presidential candidates we have ever seen has become one of the best Secretaries of State that this country has ever known. Today, women make up almost half of our workforce, the majority of students in our colleges and our graduate schools. Women are breaking barriers in every field, from science to business to sports to the Armed Forces. And today, thanks to health care reform that many of you helped pass, insurance companies can no longer deny coverage based on preexisting conditions like breast cancer or charge women more because they are more likely to incur costs for things like birth childbirth. Those same companies must cover the cost of preventive services like mammograms, domestic violence counseling, contraception. We are making sure that women in the military and our veterans get the care that they need. Today, thanks to the tireless efforts of people like Lilly Ledbetter one of my favorite people, love that woman we were backstage talking, and she was just saying how grateful she was, how much of a responsibility she now felt with this bill having been passed that was named after her.

{"id": 5088, "text": "All we did was ratify what you had already done. And because of her and other courageous women and some of the women in this room tonight, it is easier for women to demand equal pay for equal work. We passed tax credits that are keeping more women out of poverty and helping them reach the middle class. One of the first things I did after taking office was to create a White House Council on Women and Girls to make sure that every agency in the Federal Government considers the needs of women and girls in every decision they make, not as a sideshow, not as a box to check, but something that is sustained each and every day. And of course, one thing we have learned from the women's movement, from the civil rights movement, from the workers' movement, from every step that we have made to make this country more equal and more just, is that there is always more work to do. And that is especially true today, with so many Americans struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In the early days of this crisis, women were not hit quite as hard as men. Many of the jobs that we have lost over the last decade have been in construction and manufacturing, industries that traditionally had been dominated by men. And of the 15 job categories projected to grow the most in this country over the next decade, all but 2 are occupied primarily by women. But over the last couple of years, women have continued to lose jobs, especially in the public sector. It does not help that mothers are the primary or cobreadwinners in 63 percent of households, even as women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar a man does. Some of these women are single moms like my mother was, struggling just to keep up with the bills or pay a mortgage they cannot afford. I still remember my mother waking me up she worked, was going to school, and still took the time to wake me up before she went to work to go over my lessons before she left. And I would complain and grumble, and she would say, Well, this is no picnic for me either, buster. Their names do not make the history books. They are never complaining well, I will not say they are never complaining I was thinking about that for a second never hesitating to work that extra shift or that extra job if that is what it takes to give their children a better life.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalwomenslawcenterawardsdinner", "title": "Remarks at the National Women's Law Center Awards Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-womens-law-center-awards-dinner", "publication_date": "09-11-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

As hard as they are working, as much as they are sacrificing, as many responsibilities that they shoulder each and every day, we have got to make sure that they are getting the opportunities that they deserve, that somebody is standing up for them. Somebody is fighting for them. Somebody is looking out for them. Somebody is rooting for them. When we talk about these issues that primarily affect women, these are not just women's issues. When women make less than men for the same work, that hurts the entire family who has to get by with less. It hurts businesses who have fewer customers with money to spend. When a health care plan denies women coverage because of a preexisting condition, that puts a strain on emergency rooms, drives up health care costs for everybody. When any of our citizens cannot fulfill their potential because of factors that have nothing to do with their talent or their character or their work ethic, that diminishes us. It says something about who we are. If you want to look around the world, those countries that are developing fastest, that are doing the best, where their children are succeeding in school, those are societies that respect the rights of women, that are investing in our women. Now unfortunately, not everybody in Washington seems to feel the same way. In recent weeks, Republicans in the Senate have come together three times to block jobs bills that independent economists say would boost our economy and put millions back to work, including women. Each of these bills was made up of the same kinds of proposals that Democrats and Republicans have historically supported in the past, and they were fully paid for. And even though they were supported by a clear majority of the American people Republicans, Democrats, Independents every single Senate Republican said no. Said no to putting hundreds of thousands of teachers, three-quarters of them women, back in front of the classroom where they belong. No to putting construction workers back on the job and funding a special program that gets more women involved in the construction industry. We are not done yet.

Instead, they are spending time focusing on how to turn back the clock. Instead of figuring out how to put more Americans back to work, they have been trying to figure out how to take away preventive care that is covered under the Affordable Care Act. Instead of making life easier for women in this country, they want to let insurance companies go back to charging higher prices just because you are a woman. Pap smears and breast exams. That is not the right direction for this country. These folks know they cannot win on the big issues, so they are trying to make the fight about social issues that stir up their base.

Last month, I got a chance to meet the winners of the Google Science Fair. This is an international competition of high school students, the cutting edge of technology and science. All three of the winners turned out to be Americans. They had beat out 10,000 other applicants from more than 90 countries. So I had them in the Oval Office, and they explained their projects to me and I pretended that I understood what they were talking about. There is a picture of this conversation hanging up in the West Wing right now, and they are I have got a puzzled look on my face and they are being very patient. So one of the winners, Shree Bose, discovered a promising new way to improve treatment for ovarian cancer at the age of 17. Then I asked another winner, Lauren Hodge, if she had skipped a grade in school; she was quite petite. And she informed me very politely that she had actually skipped two. It is people like Shree and Lauren, all of you who are here tonight, who make me hopeful about the future. There is a direct line between those women who sat in those jail cells and those young girls explaining their science project in the Oval Office. Because that is what America is about, a place where ideas are born and dreams can grow and where a student in a classroom or a passenger on a bus or a legal secretary in an office can stand up and say, I am going to change the world. That is the kind of nation that we are. That is the kind of opportunity that must exist here in America. That is the kind of opportunity that must exist for every American, no matter what they look like or where they come from. We have come a long way towards making this country more open and more free for our daughters and theirs. We have got a lot more work to do.

Do you ever notice, you read a story and you are reading about massive fraud, but they do not write about that too much. And you are saying, Well, wait a minute, we caught thousands and hundreds of thousands of people. And then they go, While there is no evidence, they have these little soundbites. But the craziest of them all is and always done in unison because you know, they work together. If this were a business they would be put in jail because it would be called a monopoly. But the biggest and the craziest of the big lie, they call it. And I have got to tell you, I have got to say this. I have never said it before, but I have always thought it.

Remember people would come up to me during the campaign, the first campaign and they said, Sir, you know what I think about Russia? Another one would come up a month later, Sir, do you have anything to do with Russia? No, I never even thought of it. But after I got asked that question four or five times, I said, What the hell is going on with the Russia? And it was a fake deal made up by Hillary Clinton with a fake dossier where they pay. They play a different game. But you know, ultimately we are much bigger than them. We have many more people because when you go over their policies, the fact is those policies are not a 50% of the vote. We have many, many more people. If they ever had our policies, maybe there'd be no Republican party, I must be honest with you, because we have not until now. And it started with these incredible people, many of whom are sitting right here. The state senators from Arizona, it started with them.

So we need more than 10. And we have numerous categories, almost all of which are much more than we would need to win the election. If I lost by 10 and we found out that there were only two dead people, okay. There were thousands and thousands of dead people that voted in different states, thousands and thousands. Some even applied for an application to vote. Do you believe that? So not only did they vote, they applied for an application, but if had two dead people and we lost by 10,000, I do not consider that. 74,000 mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent. Other than that, it was very good. The county has refused to disclose how many of these 74,000 were in person, early votes. And how many were magically appearing in a mail-in ballot box near you? How about those boxes where they were coming in and Biden was getting 97% of the vote? In all fairness, we'd come. We came for rallies here. We had 42,000 and 44,000 and he came and he could not fill the eight circles. They had to use the fake news. No, they were calling the news. They are standing with cameras. They could not fill the eight circles. The only thing I liked about his campaign, because he did not really campaign, the cabal campaign. Lots of people campaigned for him. But I did like the, the contractor, and it was not Hunter Biden with his artistry. I am very good at building buildings and painting and all these different things. So painting, I know what a good paint job is, and you are not getting it from Hunter. In fact, I probably will not do it yet, but at some point I am going to find out the name of the contractor that did those circles, because I want to use them for some. But what about Hunter Biden getting a half a million dollars per painting, and he never painted before? Could you imagine if my kids did that? And now they are justifying it. You have good painters.

They are not getting rich from Russia. It is always Russia, Russia, Russia did it. Russia did it again. By the way, I stopped their pipeline. They have a pipeline going into Germany, going into Europe. I stopped it. I put sanctions on all these states and all of these companies who were building it. Biden approved it. Then as you know, you have heard this before he stopped the Keystone XL pipeline. They said 8,000, 48,000 jobs. And they lost all over the country. People sold their home. They were so excited that we are going to be building this pipeline. They were building it, and he stopped it like in the first week he stopped it. Yet he approves the biggest pipeline in the world, going from Russia to Germany. And we are supposed to protect Germany. I said that. I said, By the way, you would have never even heard about that pipeline if it was not for me. Nobody ever heard of that. Nobody ever talked about it until I came along. Look, I get along with Putin because that is a good thing. I got along with him. He got along with me, but nobody was ever tougher on Russia that I was. I asked Angela, and I get along with Angela too, but she is doing what she is doing for Germany.

We are becoming like a third world nation, and it is happening. Then 168,000 ballots were found to be printed on unofficial, very thin, flimsy paper.

Tell me, I wonder who they voted for. Would you say it was a hundred percent for Biden or 97%?

So did Hillary, except in five swing states where Biden wiped him out with the black population. So I think that he is not going to beat Obama, but only of these states. So he did poorly, except in these states, he had massive victories. Yet this is only the beginning of the irregularities the Arizona audit is an uncovering. The authors and the auditors have collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers lowered signature matching standards from 20 points of comparison to 10, to five, and eventually down to zero. In other words, they abolished all signature matching entirely. In other words, you have a bad signature. So the machine was picking up a lot of bad signatures. Let us lower it. Let us lower it. They brought it down to zero. So you had no signature matching. This is why the county has refused to comply with an official subpoena sent out by your great senate to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they counted ballots and whether or not they had signatures at all. Because we think many of them had no signature at all because you cannot sign them all during the night. We think they did not , and you know what else they did not have? They did not have folds. In order to have a ballot counted, it has to be folded. But so many of these pages are laying flat without a crease, without a fold. Cyber security experts have also testified that the logs for the election management system software were wiped under highly suspicious circumstances. This is them saying it, not me.

It was about 125 degrees out, sorry to bring that up. And he has a bad heart. And he said he was playing golf, but actually he was meeting on an airplane with the Attorney General discussing Hillary. I wonder what they were discussing. I was only there, I was only there to discuss my grandchildren and golf. He said he was out there to play golf, but it was about 121 degrees that day, which is a little hot. What is happening to our country has sadly happened to so many others. We are at the beginning of a communist system. Radicals are seizing power and destroying everything we hold dear as Americans and it is happening. They dismantle the rule of law, censor speech, take over the free press, imprison political opponents. Look at what I have been through for years. It was recently revealed that during the hand recount in Fulton County, Joe Biden had batches of ballots go for him. I got nothing. I got nothing. Even Fidel Castro only got 99%. So many of our state and local offices have been overtaken by corruption. The radical left install partisan Democrat prosecutors who are not interested in equal justice, but political justice. It is happening at a level that we have not seen this happen in many, many years. They would wield law enforcement against political opponents, inventing that never had been prosecuted before, while murderers and criminals walk free without prosecution at all, all over the streets of our cities in particular. They have turned our cities into Banana Republics where the innocent are persecuted while crime soars. Just look at what they have done in New York city. Innocent people are beaten in the streets daily. People are shot in Times Square. Rapes and murders are totally out of control. And yet what are the leftists and the attorney general and district attorney's offices working on so diligently? This is what they are working on so diligently and with such passion, it is get ENTITY. They campaign on getting ENTITY. Their campaign, we are going to get ENTITY. We are going to take down ENTITY.

Tomorrow I will be flying out to Illinois and Iowa to see the effects of the drought for myself. But when I heard that you were going to be here in Washington, I decided to take this day to meet with you, you who are in so many ways the leaders of American agriculture. First, let me say our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are necessary to protect America's farmers from excessive losses during this drought. Already we have taken a number of actions. We have formed an interagency drought policy committee to coordinate Federal action. The ENTITY Corps of Engineers is working hard to keep traffic moving on the Mississippi River and elsewhere in spite of some of the lowest water levels in history. And in order to help livestock owners, Secretary Lyng has permitted grazing on set-aside lands. And now is the time to start work on legislation to help the many crop farmers who will suffer substantial losses. At my direction, Secretary Lyng has been working closely with the leadership of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees in an effort to draft timely legislation. We have sought to make this a bipartisan effort, and so far I am pleased by the cooperation that we have received. Permit me to outline the five points we are seeking in this drought legislation. First, relief should go to those who need it most. Second, many of our farmers purchased Federal crop insurance, a sound business decision. They should not be penalized relative to farmers who-did not act with such prudence. Third, this legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable things. No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops. Fourth, drought relief spending has to be considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the Federal deficit; and according to the November 1987 bipartisan budget agreement that we reached with Congress, to put it very simply, we mustn't bust the budget. The automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending triggers would take back from farmers with one hand what we are providing in drought relief with the other. And finally, this humanitarian assistance should not be used as a means to other ends. Extraneous matters, such as rewriting the existing farm bill, will only deter our efforts to provide this much-needed aid.

Secretary Lyng will continue to work with the House and Senate Agriculture Committees as they mark up the drought relief package to ensure that this bipartisan, bicameral cooperation continues. And yet, even as the drought continues, we would do well to look beyond it to the long-range future of American agriculture. We all know that American farmers are more than competitive in world markets-if only those world markets give our farmers the chance to compete fairly. And this is why, under Secretary Lyng and Ambassador Clayton Yeutters guidance, we are working to increase our agricultural exports by making world trade freer and much more fair. Last July we presented at the Uruguay round in Geneva a proposal that I described as-and by the way, that is one of the best parts of this job is that from time to time you get to quote yourself but I described our proposal as the most ambitious proposal for world agricultural trade ever offered. Our proposal calls for nothing less than a total phaseout by the year 2000 of all policies that distort trade in agriculture. The solution to the world agricultural problem is to get government out of the way and let farmers compete. It is true, of course, that getting rid of all export subsidies, import barriers, and the like-all the things that make it harder for our farmers to compete in world markets-is a very tall order; but we are not backing down. At the economic summit in Toronto last month, we were able to persuade the heads of state that, at the Montreal midterm review meeting, their trade ministers must reach agreement on a goal and a timetable for completing the Uruguay round. And I can tell you after nearly 8 years of working with these heads of state, setting a deadline, a time when the talking has to stop and the action has to begin, is a very powerful instrument for getting things done. I know that you support our agricultural proposal for freer and fairer world markets. And I thank you for that support, just as I give you my heartfelt thanks for your support on a host of other things, including the textile bill and the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement.

The times behind us, gentlemen, have been difficult enough; the times before us are likely to be more difficult still, because, whatever may be said about the present condition of the world's affairs, it is clear that they are drawing rapidly to a climax, and at the climax the test will come, not only for the nations engaged in the present colossal struggle-it will come to them, of course-but the test will come for us particularly. Do you realize that, roughly speaking, we are the only great Nation at present disengaged? I am not speaking, of course, with disparagement of the greatness of those nations in Europe which are not parties to the present war, but I am thinking of their close neighborhood to it. I am thinking how their lives much more than ours touch the very heart and stuff of the business, whereas we have rolling between us and those bitter days across the water 3, 000 miles of cool and silent ocean.

We must make up our minds what are the best things to do and what are the best ways to do them. We must put our money, our energy, our enthusiasm, our sympathy into these things, and we must have our judgments prepared and our spirits chastened against the coming of that day. So that I am not speaking in a selfish spirit when I say that our whole duty, for the present at any rate, is summed up in this motto, America first. Let us think of America before we think of Europe, in order that America may be fit to be Europe's friend when the day of tested friendship comes. The test of friendship is not now sympathy with the one side or the other, but getting ready to help both sides when the struggle is over. The basis of neutrality, gentlemen, is not indifference; it is not self-interest. The basis of neutrality is sympathy for mankind. It is fairness, it is good will, at bottom. It is impartiality of spirit and of judgment. I wish that all of our fellow citizens could realize that. Men are even uttering slanders against the United States, as if to excite her. Men are saying that if we should go to war upon either side there would be a divided America-an abominable libel of ignorance! America is not all of it vocal just now. It is vocal in spots, but I, for one, have a complete and abiding faith in that great silent body of Americans who are not standing up and shouting and expressing their opinions just now, but are waiting to find out and support the duty of America. I am just as sure of their solidity and of their loyalty and of their unanimity, if we act justly, as I am that the history of this country has at every crisis and turning point illustrated this great lesson.

It is in that sense that I mean that America is a mediating Nation. The opinion of America, the action of America, is ready to turn, and free to turn, in any direction. Did you ever reflect upon how almost every other nation has through long centuries been headed in one direction? That is not true of the United States. The United States has no racial momentum. It has no history back of it which makes it run all its energies and all its ambitions in one particular direction. And America is particularly free in this, that she has no hampering ambitions as a world power. We do not want a foot of anybody's territory. If we have been obliged by circumstances, or have considered ourselves to be obliged by circumstances, in the past, to take territory which we otherwise would not have thought of taking, I believe I am right in saying that we have considered it our duty to administer that territory, not for ourselves but for the people living in it, and to put this burden upon our consciences-not to think that this thing is ours for our use, but to regard ourselves as trustees of the great business for those to whom it does really belong, trustees ready to hand it over to the cestui que trust at any time when the business seems to make that possible and feasible. That is what I mean by saying we have no hampering ambitions. We do not want anything that does not belong to us. Is not a nation in that position free to serve other nations, and is not a nation like that ready to form some part of the assessing opinion of the world?

And I want to also thank Dawn Sweeny and everyone at the National Restaurant Association for having me here. It is a pleasure for me to be with you all. So today I am going to talk about food, which is something that all of you here today know a little bit about. Together, you represent 40 percent of the nearly one million restaurants in the United States, from the biggest chains to the smallest diners. You know what Americans like to eat and what they do not . You have seen how the ingredients we put in our bodies affect the way we feel and the way we feel about ourselves. And you also understand the unique role that food, and restaurants especially, play in our own lives and in the life of our nation. Restaurants have always been places to celebrate a special occasion or mark an important milestone, to bond with new friends and grow closer as a family. They provide a service to our communities unlike any other. And even as tastes and customs have changed over time, restaurants remain an incredibly dynamic part of our American story. And today, one out of every two dollars spent on food in this country goes towards meals outside the home -- and that is double what it was just 50 years ago. And one-third of all meals today are eaten in restaurants. So it is clear that eating out has become part of our American way of life. And while restaurants are still places where we go to mark a special occasion -- to celebrate a good report card, an anniversary, a job well done -- restaurants are not just for those who can afford to splurge anymore. Instead, they have grown to fit every lifestyle and every budget. And our eating habits have evolved over time as well -- both in restaurants and at home -- but not always in ways that are good for our health. And that is another reason I wanted to talk to you today -- about an issue that is near and dear to my heart not just as First Lady, but as a mother -- and that is the epidemic of childhood obesity in America today. how one in three children in this country is overweight or obese.

{"id": 5157, "text": "So it is clear that we are facing a problem that is really big. And it is also clear that this problem has a whole range of different causes. Our kids are spending less time outside and more time on the couch in front of the TV, video games, the Internet. At school, gym classes, recess, they have been eliminated or shortened. Portion sizes in this country have ballooned. In some areas, families are having a tougher time getting regular access to fresh produce. And kids these days are consuming more calories and eating more fat and sugar than ever before. We want to solve the problem of childhood obesity in a generation, so that kids born today can reach adulthood at a healthy weight. And Let us Move! is about attacking this problem from all different angles. It is about giving parents the information and the resources they need to make healthy decisions for their families. It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice. And the truth is that while restaurants are offering more options and families take advantage of them more often, they are not always the healthiest choices. Research has shown that kids consume more saturated fat and less fiber and calcium when they eat out. And the meals they eat at restaurants have twice as many calories as the ones they eat at home. Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently. But when stores and restaurants do not offer healthy options, or when parents do not have the information to make the best choices for their families, that is easier said than done.

And we need your help now, because when you see research showing that obese toddlers already display some warning signs for heart disease, it is clear that we just do not have the time to waste. And that is why I have been so pleased to hear about what some of you are doing already both in working with us and on your own. Here at the NRA, you have developed the Food and Healthy Living Initiative to give restaurants a strong foundation for making healthy changes. You have launched a website, Healthydiningfinder.com, to help consumers identify healthy menu options in their area. You are keeping your members up to date with the latest information and statistics about efforts to address childhood obesity. And you are working with other groups in the industry to meet the goal of doubling the amount of produce used in the food industry over the next 10 years. And across the country, individual restaurants and chains are also focusing on our children's health -- not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it also makes sense for their bottom line. Right now, many restaurants are making a point to offer fresh produce and healthy choices aimed at kids and adults. Others are serving more low-fat dishes, whole grain breads, fruit on the side. Some are even offering kid-size portions of the meals they serve on the main menu. And chefs across the country are partnering with local schools to help them make healthy choices. Together we have to do more. And we need your help to lead this effort. Now, what I do know is that in the restaurant industry creativity is your lifeblood. It is what sets you apart from the competition, and it keeps customers coming back for more. And today I am asking you to use that creativity to rethink the food you offer, especially dishes aimed at young people, and to help us make the healthier choice the easier choice. First, it is important to reduce the number of empty calories that our families are consuming, calories that have no nutritional benefit whatsoever. And believe me, I know this is easier said than done. After all, we as humans, we are programmed to crave sugary, fatty, salty foods. And as people who work to meet those needs, I know it is tempting to respond by creating products that are sweeter, richer and saltier than ever before. See, feeding those cravings does just respond to people's natural desires, it actually helps shape them.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 5159, "text": "The more of these foods people eat, the more they are accustomed to that taste, and after a while, those unhealthy foods become a permanent part of their eating habits. It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And today, no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is Italian, French, Mexican, American -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. One local survey found that 90 percent of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; 80 percent includes chicken fingers; 60 includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over 1,000 calories, and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for the entire day. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just one token healthy option on the menu, or taking out one problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime. This philosophy also needs to apply to the rest of the food that you offer, because just as we eat out as a family, we also should be able to eat well as a family.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 5160, "text": "And as a mother of two soon-to-be teenagers, I know that many kids, especially tweens and teens, eat off the same menu that their parents do. I am not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love. That could mean substituting wheat pasta for white pasta in your regular recipes, or taking out an existing -- taking an existing dish and cutting the amount of butter or cream -- not enough to sacrifice flavor -- we all like flavor -- but just enough to make a meaningful difference in the amount of calories and fat. It could mean serving 1 percent or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request -- which would hurt me deeply. And no matter what you do, it is also important, truly important, to keep portion sizes in check, because we all know that the size of a meal is just as important as the ingredients it is made of. But your role in helping address childhood obesity is not limited to what you put on your menus and how you label them for parents. It is also about how you market those products to our kids. Our kids do not learn about the latest fast-food creations on their own. They hear about them on TV, advertisements, in the Internet, video games, and many other places. As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids. A study last year found that only a small percentage of advertising aimed at kids promoted healthy foods, while most promoted foods with a low nutritional value. It is not enough just to limit ads for foods that are not healthy. It is also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy. And if there is anyone who can sell healthy food to our kids, it is all of you, because you know what gets their attention. You know what makes a lasting impression. You certainly know what gets them to drive their poor parents crazy because they just have to have something.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}

Again, I know many of you have said that you would offer and promote healthy options in a heartbeat if they were as popular as the healthy -- unhealthy options, because that is how business works, and I understand that. But I have yet to meet a single parent who does not understand the threat of childhood obesity. I have yet to meet a single parent who is not eager to buy healthier products. They just need more information. They need easier access to those products. And I have heard from more companies over the year that the market is starting to move in a healthier direction. Folks are beginning to ask for more fruits and vegetables and for smaller portions. So when it comes right down to it, this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again. That is why we are committed to helping increase that demand and making it easier for you to do what is right. And we have started by requiring chain restaurants to provide calorie counts on their menus and menu boards. And I am grateful for the support we have received from the NRA to get this done. And I want to encourage restaurants that are not providing calorie counts to join us in this effort. And because so many of the calories our kids consume come from school, we are also working to get more nutritious food into our lunchrooms and our vending machines. And, again, the NRA has been playing an important role in these efforts as well. As part of Let us Move, we are setting a goal of doubling the number of schools that participate in the Healthier US Schools Challenge by next year. And we are working with schools and food suppliers to offer more fruits and vegetables and to cut down on that fat, sugar and salt. And, finally, we are working with mayors and other local officials to make our cities and towns healthier and to highlight restaurants that agree to serve smaller portions and promote more nutritious options. So I hope that all of you will join with us in these efforts. Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice. We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "title": "Michelle Obama Remarks by the First Lady in Address to the National Restaurant Association Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-first-lady-address-the-national-restaurant-association-meeting", "publication_date": "13-09-2010", "crawling_date": "30-06-2023", "politician": ["Michele Obama"], "gender": ["F"]}}

Our founders launched not only a revolution in government, but a revolution in the pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity. No nation has done more to advance the human condition than the United States of America and no people have done more to promote human progress than the citizens of our great nation. It was all made possible by the courage of 56 patriots who gathered in Philadelphia 244 years ago and signed the Declaration of Independence.

And yet, as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure. Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children. Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities. Many of these people have no idea why they are doing this, but some know what they are doing. They think the American people are weak and soft and submissive, but no, the American people are strong and proud and they will not allow our country and all of its values, history, and culture to be taken from them. One of their political weapons is cancel culture, driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees. This is the very definition of totalitarianism, and it is completely alien to our culture and to our values and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America. This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty must be stopped and it will be stopped very quickly. We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation's children from this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life.

If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished. It is not going to happen to us. This left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger, and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery, and progress.

Under the executive order I signed last week pertaining to the Veterans Memorial Preservation Memorial and Recognition Act and other laws, people who damage or deface federal statues or monuments will get a minimum of 10 years in prison and obviously that includes our beautiful Mount Rushmore. Our people have a great memory. They will never forget the destruction of statues and monuments to George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionists and many others. The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets and cities that are run by liberal Democrats in every case is the predictable result of years of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism, and other cultural institutions. Against every law of society and nature, our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains. The radical view of American history is a web of lies, all perspective is removed, every virtue is obscured, every motive is twisted, every fact is distorted and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition. This movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on Mount Rushmore. They defiled the memory of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Today we will set history and history's record straight. Before these figures were immortalized in stone, they were American giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men, whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known. Tonight I will tell you and most importantly the youth of our nation the true stories of these great, great men. From head to toe George Washington represented the strength, grace, and dignity of the American people. From a small volunteer force of citizen farmers, he created the Continental ENTITY out of nothing and rallied them to stand against the most powerful military on earth.

They marched through nine miles of frigid darkness, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. In the morning, they seized victory at Trenton after forcing the surrender of the most powerful empire on the planet at Yorktown, General Washington did not claim power but simply returned to Mount Vernon as a private citizen. When called upon again, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was unanimously elected our first president. When he stepped down after two terms, his former adversary, King George called him the greatest man of the age. He remains first in our hearts to this day, for as long as Americans love this land, we will honor and cherish the father of our country, George Washington. He will never be removed, abolished, and most of all, he will never be forgotten. Thomas Jefferson, the great Thomas Jefferson, was 33 years old when he traveled north to Pennsylvania and brilliantly authored one of the greatest treasures of human history, the Declaration of Independence. He also drafted Virginia's constitution and conceived and wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, a model for our cherished First Amendment. After serving as the first Secretary of State, and then Vice President, he was elected to the presidency. He ordered American warriors to crush Barbary pirates. He doubled the size of our nation with the Louisiana Purchase and he sent the famous explorers Lewis and Clark into the west on a daring expedition to the Pacific Ocean. He was an architect, an inventor, a diplomat, a scholar, the founder of one of the world's great universities and an ardent defender of liberty. Americans will forever admire the author of American freedom, Thomas Jefferson, and he too will never, ever be abandoned by us. Abraham Lincoln, the savior of our union, was a self-taught country lawyer who grew up in a log cabin on the American frontier.

He served as commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces during our bloodiest war, the struggle that saved our union and extinguished the evil of slavery. Over 600,000 died in that war, more than 20, 000 were killed or wounded in a single day in Antietam. At Gettysburg 157 years ago, the Union bravely withstood an assault of nearly 15,000 men and threw back Pickett's Charge. Lincoln won the Civil War. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He led the passage of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery for all-time and ultimately his determination to preserve our nation and our union cost him his life. For as long as we live, Americans will uphold and revere the immortal memory of President Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt exemplified the unbridled confidence of our national culture and identity. He saw the towering grandeur of America's mission in the world and he pursued it with overwhelming energy and zeal. As a Lieutenant Colonel during the Spanish-American War, he led the famous Rough Riders to defeat the enemy at San Juan Hill. He cleaned up corruption as police commissioner of New York City, then served as the Governor of New York, Vice President, and at 42 years old, became the youngest ever President of the United States. He sent our great new naval fleet around the globe to announce America's arrival as a world power. He gave us many of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon.

First of all, somebody who I believe is one of the finest governors in this country -- Ted Strickland is here. The lieutenant-governor and soon-to-be junior senator from the great state of Illinois -- or Ohio -- I was thinking about my own home -- Lee Fisher is here. I used to hear that line all the time about senator from Illinois -- that would be me. Outstanding mayor of Cleveland, Frank Jackson is here. The mayor of Parma, Dean DePiero. Somebody who is fighting for working families each and every day, Senator Sherrod Brown is here. It is good to be back in Ohio. You know, in the fall of 2008, one of the last rallies of my presidential campaign was right here in the Cleveland area. It was a hopeful time, just two days before the election. And we knew that if we pulled it off, we'd finally have the chance to tackle some big and difficult challenges that had been facing this country for a very long time. We also hoped for a chance to get beyond some of the old political divides -- between Democrats and Republicans, red states and blue states -- that had prevented us from making progress. Because although we are proud to be Democrats, we are prouder to be Americans ---- and we believed then and we believe now that no single party has a monopoly on wisdom. That is not to say that the election did not expose deep differences between the parties. Cut taxes, especially for millionaires and billionaires. Cut trade deals even if they did not benefit our workers. The idea was that if we just had blind faith in the market, if we let corporations play by their own rules, if we left everyone else to fend for themselves that America would grow and America would prosper. And for a time this idea gave us the illusion of prosperity. We saw financial firms and CEOs take in record profits and record bonuses. We saw a housing boom that led to new homeowners and new jobs in construction. Consumers bought more condos and bigger cars and better TVs. Nobody understands that more than the people of Ohio. Job growth between 2000 and 2008 was slower than it had been in any economic expansion since World War II -- slower than it is been over the last year.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "clevelandcomopen201009transcriptofpresidentobamas1html", "title": "Transcript of President Obama's speech at Cuyahoga Community College", "source": "https://www.cleveland.com/open/2010/09/transcript_of_president_obamas_1.html", "publication_date": "", "crawling_date": "02-07-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Folks were forced to put more debt on their credit cards and borrow against homes that many could not afford to buy in the first place. And meanwhile, a failure to pay for two wars and two tax cuts for the wealthy helped turn a record surplus into a record deficit. I ran for President because I believed that this kind of economy was unsustainable -- for the middle class and for the future of our nation. I ran because I had a different idea about how America was built. It was an idea rooted in my own family's story. You see, Michelle and I are where we are today because even though our families did not have much, they worked tirelessly -- without complaint -- so that we might have a better life. My grandfather marched off to Europe in World War II, while my grandmother worked in factories on the home front. I had a single mom who put herself through school, and would wake before dawn to make sure I got a decent education. Michelle can still remember her father heading out to his job as a city worker long after multiple sclerosis had made it impossible for him to walk without crutches. He always got to work; he just had to get up a little earlier. Yes, our families believed in the American values of self-reliance and individual responsibility, and they instilled those values in their children. But they also believed in a country that rewards responsibility; a country that rewards hard work; a country built on the promise of opportunity and upward mobility. They believed in an America that gave my grandfather the chance to go to college because of the GI Bill; an America that gave my grandparents the chance to buy a home because of the Federal Housing Authority; an America that gave their children and grandchildren the chance to fulfill our dreams thanks to college loans and college scholarships. It was an America where you did not buy things you could not afford; where we did not just think about today -- we thought about tomorrow. An America that took pride in the goods that we made, not just the things we consumed. An America where a rising tide really did lift all boats, from the company CEO to the guy on the assembly line.

It is what led me to run for President -- because I do not believe we can have a strong and growing economy without a strong and growing middle class. Now, much has happened since that election. The flawed policies and economic weaknesses of the previous decade culminated in a financial crisis and the worst recession of our lifetimes. And my hope was that the crisis would cause everybody, Democrats and Republicans, to pull together and tackle our problems in a practical way. Some Republican leaders figured it was smart politics to sit on the sidelines and let Democrats solve the mess. Others believed on principle that government should not meddle in the markets, even when the markets are broken. But with the nation losing nearly 800,000 jobs the month that I was sworn into office, my most urgent task was to stop a financial meltdown and prevent this recession from becoming a second depression. And, Ohio, we have done that. The private sector has created jobs for the last eight months in a row. And there are roughly 3 million Americans who are working today because of the economic plan we put into place. Millions of jobs were lost before our policies even had a chance to take effect. We lost 4 million in the six months before I took office. It was a hole so deep that even though we have added jobs again, millions of Americans remain unemployed. Hundreds of thousands of families have lost their homes. Millions more can barely pay the bills or make the mortgage. The middle class is still treading water, and those aspiring to reach the middle class are doing everything they can to keep from drowning. And meanwhile, some of the very steps that were necessary to save the economy -- like temporarily supporting the banks and the auto industry -- fed the perception that Washington is still ignoring the middle class in favor of special interests. And so people are frustrated and they are angry and they are anxious about the future. I understand that. I also understand that in a political campaign, the easiest thing for the other side to do is to ride this fear and anger all the way to Election Day.

Cut more taxes for millionaires and cut more rules for corporations. Instead of coming together like past generations did to build a better country for our children and grandchildren, their argument is that we should let insurance companies go back to denying care for folks who are sick, or let credit card companies go back to raising rates without any reason. Instead of setting our sights higher, they are asking us to settle for a status quo of stagnant growth and eroding competitiveness and a shrinking middle class. A lot has changed since I came here in those final days of the last election, but what has not is the choice facing this country. It is still fear versus hope; the past versus the future. That is what this election is about. That is the choice you will face in November. Now, we have a different vision for the future. See, I have never believed that government has all the answers to our problems. I have never believed that government's role is to create jobs or prosperity. I believe it is the drive and the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs, our small businesses; the skill and dedication of our workers ---- that is made us the wealthiest nation on Earth. I believe it is the private sector that must be the main engine for our recovery. I believe government should leave people free to make the choices they think are best for themselves and their families, so long as those choices do not hurt others. But in the words of the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, I also believe that government should do for the people what they cannot do better for themselves. investments in education and clean energy, in basic research and technology and infrastructure. That means making sure corporations live up to their responsibilities to treat consumers fairly and play by the same rules as everyone else. Their responsibility is to look out for their workers, as well as their shareholders, and create jobs here at home.

{"id": 5199, "text": "That is what we Democrats believe in -- a vibrant free market, but one that works for everybody. That is our vision for a stronger economy and a growing middle class. And that is the difference between what we and Republicans in Congress are offering the American people right now. Let me give you a few specific examples of our different approaches. This week, I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. One of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in the United States. But for years, our tax code has actually given billions of dollars in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in Ohio, right here in the United States of America. And I am proposing that all American businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in 2011. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like Cleveland and Toledo and Dayton. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. For years, Republicans have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. Boehner was here in Cleveland he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like Ohio keep hundreds of thousands of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. Boehner dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps America strong. And, Ohio, I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in America -- not that create jobs overseas. That is one difference between the Republican vision and the Democratic vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example. We want to put more Americans back to work rebuilding America -- our roads, our railways, our runways.

{"id": 5200, "text": "That is partly why our economic plan has invested in badly needed infrastructure projects over the last 19 months -- not just roads and bridges, but high-speed railroads and expanded broadband access. Altogether, these projects have led to thousands of good, private sector jobs, especially for those in the trades. Boehner and the Republicans in Congress said no to these projects. Though I should say it did not stop a lot of them from showing up at the ribbon-cuttings ---- trying to take credit. And engineers, economists, governors, mayors of every political stripe believe that if we want to compete in this global economy, we need to rebuild this vital infrastructure. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the most modern airports -- we want to put people to work building them right here in America. So this week, I have proposed a six-year infrastructure plan that would start putting Americans to work right away. But despite the fact that this has traditionally been an issue with bipartisan support, Mr. Boehner has so far said no to infrastructure. That is bad for America -- and that, too, is what this election is all about. I will give you one final example of the differences between us and the Republicans, and that is on the issue of tax cuts. Under the tax plan passed by the last administration, taxes are scheduled to go up substantially next year -- for everybody. By the way, this was by design. When they passed these tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, they did not want everybody to know what it would do to our deficit, so they pretended like they were going to end, even though now they say they do not . Now, I believe we ought to make the tax cuts for the middle class permanent. These families are the ones who saw their wages and incomes flat-line over the last decade -- you deserve a break. You deserve some help. And because folks in the middle class are more likely to spend their tax cut on basic necessities, that strengthens the economy as a whole. But the Republican leader of the House does not want to stop there. He and his party believe we should also give a permanent tax cut to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "clevelandcomopen201009transcriptofpresidentobamas1html", "title": "Transcript of President Obama's speech at Cuyahoga Community College", "source": "https://www.cleveland.com/open/2010/09/transcript_of_president_obamas_1.html", "publication_date": "", "crawling_date": "02-07-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5201, "text": "With all the other budgetary pressures we have -- with all the Republicans' talk about wanting to shrink the deficit -- they would have us borrow $700 billion over the next 10 years to give a tax cut of about $100,000 each to folks who are already millionaires. And keep in mind wealthy Americans are just about the only folks who saw their incomes rise when Republicans were in charge. And these are the folks who are less likely to spend the money -- which is why economists do not think tax breaks for the wealthy would do much to boost the economy. We should not hold middle-class tax cuts hostage any longer. We are ready, this week, if they want, to give tax cuts to every American making $250,000 or less. That is 98-97 percent of Americans. Now, for any income over this amount, the tax rates would just go back to what they were under President Clinton. This is not to punish folks who are better off -- God bless them. It is because we cannot afford the $700 billion price tag. And for those who claim that our approach would somehow be bad for growth and bad for small businesses, let me remind you that with those tax rates in place, under President Clinton, this country created 22 million jobs and raised incomes and had the largest surplus in our history. In fact, if the Republican leadership in Congress really wants to help small businesses, they will stop using legislative maneuvers to block an up or down vote on a small business jobs bill that is before the Senate right now. This is a bill that would do two things. It would cut taxes for small businesses and make loans more available for small businesses. It is fully paid for, will not add to the deficit. And it was written by Democrats and Republicans. And yet, the other party continues to block this jobs bill -- a delay that small business owners have said is actually leading them to put off hiring. Look, I recognize that most of the Republicans in Congress have said no to just about every policy I have proposed since taking office. I realize in some cases that there are genuine philosophical differences. But on issues like this one -- a tax cut for small businesses supported by the Chamber of Commerce -- the only reason they are holding this up is politics, pure and simple.

We see a future where we invest in American innovation and American ingenuity; where we export more goods so we create more jobs here at home; where we make it easier to start a business or patent an invention; where we build a homegrown, clean energy industry -- because I do not want to see new solar panels or electric cars or advanced batteries manufactured in Europe or Asia.

And finally, we see an America where we refuse to pass on the debt we inherited to the next generation. Now, let me spend just a minute on this issue, because we have heard a lot of moralizing on the other side about this -- government spending and debt. Along with the tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they will stop government spending. Now, it is right to be concerned about the long-term deficit. If we do not get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it is time for government to show some discipline, too. But let us look at the facts. When these same Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down. These same Republicans turned a record surplus into a record deficit. When I walked in, wrapped in a nice bow was a $1.3 trillion deficit sitting right there on my doorstep. Just this year, these same Republicans voted against a bipartisan fiscal commission that they themselves had proposed. Once I decided I was for it, they were against it. And when you ask them what programs they'd actually cut they do not have an answer. Now, I will be honest -- I refuse to cut back on those investments that will grow our economy in the future -- investments in areas like education and clean energy and technology. I do not want to cut those things. And that is because economic growth is the single best way to bring down the deficit -- and we need these investments to grow. But I am absolutely committed to fiscal responsibility, which is why I have already proposed freezing all discretionary spending unrelated to national security for the next three years.

The turkey's name is Liberty--there he is--and along with his understudy named Peace, he has the distinction of being the luckiest bird on the face of the Earth. Right now he is also probably one of the most confused. Liberty was chosen from a flock of about 30 other contestants for the honor of being here today.

Now, I am told that in order to prepare Liberty and Peace for their big day, the students exposed them to loud noises and flashbulbs so that they'd be ready to face the White House press corps. They also received the most important part of their media training, which involves learning how to gobble without really saying anything. So Liberty is ready for his turn in the spotlight.

He understands if you lower the bar, assign certain kids to failure based upon demographics, that is precisely what you will get in the State of Maryland. So he said, We ought to raise the bar. They understand that high standards will yield high results. And the best place to start in achieving high standards is with the littlest of children. I want to thank very much Congressman John Boehner for coming today. The Congressman is not from Maryland; he is from Ohio. But he is an important figure since he is the chairman of the House Education Committee which is marking up legislation which will help us spread excellence to the Head Start programs all across the country. I look forward to continuing to work with him. He also is one of the authors of what we call the No Child Left Behind Act, which I will talk about a little bit later. But the No Child Left Behind Act essentially says we expect every child to learn, and there is going to be high standards and strong accountability measures to every State in the Union. In return for increased Title I funding and in return for an increase in the Federal budget of elementary and secondary schools act money, we expect results. You see, we are not going to just spend money and hope something positive happens. We are going to spend money and see results. Well, if you believe in high standards and accountability, then it is really important to get the young kids up to the starting line at the same time. And that is why the Head Start reforms we are going to talk about are important, the reforms which John and his committee are carrying to the floor of the House relatively soon. I want to thank Nancy Grasmick, who is the State superintendent of schools in Maryland. I appreciate Andre Hornsby as the superintendent of schools, an even tougher job. Government closest to the people is sometimes government that is the hardest. And I want to thank Guylaine Richard, who is the program director for the Head Start. I appreciate, Guylaine, you opening up this chance for me to come and see a program which works.

I appreciate the-Tonya Riggins, who is the Highland Park Head Start Center coordinator. I want to thank Lisa Dunmore and Alice Williams, the two fine teachers we had to meet. For the teachers who are here, thank you for doing what you are doing. You are a part of a noble profession, an incredibly important profession for the future of this country. You know what I know, that reading is the key to all learning. And the research-I see some of my friends from the National Research Council, National Institutions of Child Health who are here. He understands how the brain works, and he is spent a lot of time analyzing what works and what does not work. He caught my attention when I was the Governor of Texas. I would ask him a question, Are you sure we can teach kids, you know, the so-called impossible-to-teach? He said, Sure, I know it. And so he started doing research to convince the people about the real future. And he says that-he and his fellow researchers-that preschoolers can learn much more than we ever thought possible about words and sounds. In other words, society limited how much a certain-how much a preschooler could learn. It kind of felt like certain things were impossible to-certain knowledge was impossible to impart to our children, particularly the young. And so I want to thank Reid and the good folks who are focusing on science, who have opened up a tremendous realm of possibility now to achieve that which we want, a literate America. Even the youngest child can learn that we read words and letters from left to right or that letters are associated with sounds; even the youngest of toddlers can figure that out over time. In one exercise, children clapped for each syllable in a word. They can trace letters on the page to begin to understand the movements we use to write. They can play word games and learn rhymes and songs that help them to develop their own vocabulary. That sounds like a simple curriculum, but it is research-based, all aimed at laying the foundation for children to become good readers. These are what we call the building blocks, and these building blocks need to be a part of Head Start programs all across America. Research also shows that if children do not develop these skills before they reach kindergarten, they will struggle to achieve success in their lives.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 5210, "text": "Now, we need to listen to that kind of research in America. If the scientists come together and say, If we fail in our mission to give children the foundation necessary for reading, they will fall behind and may not be able to develop the skills necessary, so they have to struggle in life, we got a-this is an opportunity that we better not miss. We cannot let our children down. Now look, Head Start is a great opportunity to provide the foundation for reading. And first, I just want everybody to understand, Head Start does a good job of giving children nutrition and medical care. That has been primarily the focus, and the program needs to be applauded for meeting that goal. And nobody in this room wants Head Start to change that focus. We just want an additional focus to Head Start, and the Head Start focus is teaching the basics for reading and math. That is the new focus, along with health and nutrition. Even though most children in Head Start make some educational progress, most of them still leave the program with skills and knowledge levels that are far below what we expect. Now, in my line of work, if you see a problem, you address it. And I see that as a problem. If we are not meeting expectations, if we are not challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, let us start right now in America. We want Head Start to set higher ambitions for the million children it serves. And so I laid out a plan. Every Head Start center must prepare children to succeed by teaching the basics of learning and literacy. That is the cornerstone of the plan. And every Head Start teacher must have the skills necessary to do so. And so we started last year when we launched the Strategic Teacher Education Program, STEP, to train 3,300 Head Start teachers and supervisors in the C.I.R.C.L.E. program, which is used right here at this school. In other words, it is a go-by. It is not a difficult chore for a teacher to take the basic learning from the C.I.R.C.L.E. program developed by the scientists and implement it at the Head Start program in which he or she teaches. Tonya Riggins, the assistant Head Start supervisor at Highland Park, was one of the teachers in the program. Tonya and thousands of other trained teachers went back to train other teachers at the program. So it is going to-we started with 3,300.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

It is a-and by the way, as new teachers are added, they too will be given the tools necessary to teach the program. Now, in order to make sure that the C.I.R.C.L.E. program is-and other curriculums which work-are being used, is working, I believe there needs to be an evaluation program. And after all, if we are spending a lot of taxpayers' money, which we are, it makes sense to determine whether or not these programs are, in fact, laying the foundation for reading. Now, I fully understand a 4-year-old child is not going to take a standardized test. That we would-we would be defeating the purpose of accountability before we even began if we said, Okay, we will give standardized tests to 4-year-olds. But we can have children assessed by asking simple questions. You know, words go left to right. Are you able to identify certain sounds? Are they developed by-developing the key skills necessary? And I think what needs to happen is- and I hope Congress agrees-that the simple evaluations at the beginning of the year and the end of the year will tell us whether or not progress is being made in developing a curriculum necessary to teach children how to read. And if they are, we ought to be praising the programs, and if they are not, something else ought to happen. We cannot miss the opportunity much longer in America. And so Boehner is here because his committee and the Congress is considering legislation that would put a new emphasis on language skills and literacy skills in Head Start programs. In other words, we are going to codify into law that which we have started through the teacher training program. The legislation will require Head Start providers to teach language, reading, and writing skills, as well as early math skills. In other words, it now becomes a part- when they pass the law that says the Head Start mission is further defined as an educational mission. And those programs that are used must be proven by scientific research. We are going to have high standards. We are going to trust the local people to develop the curriculum, but in return for Federal money, we want you to measure to tell us whether or not children are learning to read and write.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshighlandparkelementaryschoollandovermaryland", "title": "Remarks at Highland Park Elementary School in Landover, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-highland-park-elementary-school-landover-maryland", "publication_date": "07-07-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

And therefore, we are asking people to develop an accountability system without everybody being at the same starting position. And that is why it is so important for preschool programs to be focused on literacy, so that when the accountability systems kick in in Maryland or Texas or anybody else, we can truthfully say that every child has been given the tools necessary to be at the starting line at the same time, so that we have true accountability, true measurement. Now, there is Governors around the State, the country that have said, Look, give us the flexibility to be able to dovetail the Head Start program into our preschool programs so that all students-so we have a better control over whether or not the students are given the skills necessary so that when you hold us to account, we can achieve that which we want to achieve, which is excellence in the classroom. I appreciate the desire for flexibility. I support the Governors' desire for flexibility so long as, one, Federal monies going to the States are used only for Head Start. In other words, what we really do not want to do is say we are going to focus on Head Start; the Head Start money goes for, you know, a prison complex. I know that will not happen with Governor Ehrlich, but there needs to be a guarantee that the Federal money spent on Head Start only go to Head Start. Secondly, States and local governments must put money into the program, which would lock in the Head Start money for Head Start. So, in other words, the flexibility given to the State would not allow the States budget flexibility. It is management flexibility to be able to take the Head Start program, dovetail into the preschool program, then the kindergarten program, and then into the elementary school program. Governors ought to have that flexibility to-hope that Congress will provide that flexibility so that when the accountability systems kick in, fully kick in, that a Governor can truthfully say, Well, I have had the tools necessary to make sure the Head Start program fits into an overall comprehensive plan for literacy and math for every child in the State of Maryland, in Governor Ehrlich's case.

This morning I will be signing a proclamation to implement the terms of the registration act that the Congress recently passed. I would like to say at the beginning that this is a very wise decision that the Congress has made. And I would like to emphasize that the registration act-which has now been passed and will go into effect-is not to threaten war, but is to preserve peace. The action taken by our country and almost all other nations in the democratic world is designed to preserve peace. We are deeply concerned about the unwarranted and vicious invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and occupation by them of this innocent and defenseless country, which is completely unwarranted. We have taken a series of steps-economic, diplomatic, political, military steps-in order to convince the Soviet Union that their action is ill advised and, of course, encouraging them to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and also to prevent further aggression if they should be tempted to do so. All of the action we have taken is peaceful in nature, and we will stay committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes. The freedom-fighters in Afghanistan, who are striving for the liberation of their country, deserve the admiration of the entire world, and their courage and persistence in fighting for freedom is the greatest single deterrent to the Soviet aggression being successful. I would like to emphasize that the registration act is not a draft; I am not in favor of a peacetime draft. This registration act will do a great deal to marshal our own Nation's resistance to succumbing to temptation which might lead to war, and therefore lead to a mandatory draft. The only time that I envision a mandatory draft law being advocated to the Congress would be in time of war or in time of national emergency, and in a case of that kind, when our Nation's security is threatened, separate legal action would be required by Congress, a separate law, to initiate a draft under those circumstances.

He called for fire extinguishers to fight back the flames. He tended to the wounded. He led those survivors down the stairs to safety and carried a woman on his shoulders down 17 flights. And then, he went back, back up all those flights, then back down again, bringing more wounded to safety. Until that moment when the tower fell. They did not know his name.

Those words, spoken by an Italian, are as American as the Declaration of Independence-for that matter, as British as the Common Law and as French as the writings of Montesquieu. They could be called the common credo of every democratic nation across the Earth. Yet if freedom, democracy, and the rights of man are to be preserved through the ages, free men and women must accept the responsibilities that go with their freedoms. And this is why I wanted to take some time out after the summit to meet with you, because as business men and women, as citizens, you have been leaders in taking up the responsibilities of liberty. Again and again, over the years, all of you have volunteered yourselves and your corporations to causes that have helped make life better for the people of both Italy and America and of people all over the world. When you have seen a need to be filled, a job to be done, you have not waited for government to lead the way; you have set out and got the work done yourselves. And let me say that we can see all around us testimony to the strength here in Italy of voluntarism and of private giving, of what we in America sometimes call private sector initiatives. It was a private sector initiative by Fiat that restored this magnificent building, the Palazzo Grassi. And just down the Grand Canal are the noble horses of St. Mark's Basilica, which through an initiative by Olivetti have toured the world, showing something of the beauty of Venice to many who will not have the opportunity to come to this great city. Yes, in country after country, private sector initiatives are teaching children, caring for the sick, helping the poor build better lives for themselves, and searching for ways to cure disease. Whether people are in sickness, sorrow, or in need, private sector initiatives have been created to answer the call. Last November in Paris, at the International Conference on Private Sector Initiatives, men and women from seven nations showed that yours is an international movement. Yesterday in Milan you continued the work you began in Paris with a new exchange of ideas.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheitalianamericanconferenceprivatesectorinitiativesveniceitaly", "title": "Remarks at the Italian-American Conference on Private Sector Initiatives in Venice, Italy", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-italian-american-conference-private-sector-initiatives-venice-italy", "publication_date": "11-06-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We have held productive discussions on subjects ranging from East-West relations to terrorism to economic policy and free trade. These meetings are important, and they have received, as they should, a great deal of attention from the press. And yet I cannot help thinking that any true history of our times will show that your work, and that of millions of free men and women all around the world, has done as much to build the future of our civilization as have all the statesmen in all the summits over the years. History has shown that governments alone cannot possibly meet the challenges of a growing world. I believe that private sector initiatives will provide many solutions to the challenges of the 21st century. They are already giving us lasting symbols of the friendships between democratic peoples and countries on which European and American peace and prosperity have been built over the last 40 years. In this regard, I am pleased to commend the National Italian-American Foundation for their efforts in restoring a magnificent garden here in Venice. This Italian-American Friendship Garden will be a lasting reminder of this meeting in Venice. And Jim Robinson has just announced another step in Italian-American friendship. This innovative program will contribute to the restoration of other Italian national treasures. It is a fine example of private sector initiatives at work. I want to thank all those involved in these projects as well as the members of my board of advisors on private sector initiatives and their Italian counterparts, who have made this conference possible. By shouldering the responsibilities of freedom, you are helping to preserve freedom, to preserve this great hope for all mankind that our countries represent. And the voices that thank you come not just from Italy and America, not just from Europe, but from throughout the world. And Frank, I have to tell you, in giving me this honor, which you have just given me, kind of makes things all right for the industry that I once was in, the motion picture industry. We had an actor there who was only being an actor in Hollywood long enough to get the money to come to Italy, because he aspired to an operatic career. And he went to Milan, and he studied. And then he was asked to sing in Pagliacci, the very spiritual fountainhead of opera.

My voice is gone; I cannot do it again. And a voice from the balcony said, You will do it until you get it right. You know, all that we talked about, I just have to tell you one last little incident here that is really true of what brings us together here-private initiative. I am sure that our people have told you that there in Washington now, we have in the computers some 3,000 programs where some little hamlet or village or town has found a problem and a way to solve it themselves. And we keep this, because then when inquiries come from people that say what could we do about it, we go to the computers and are able to tell them how a program was set up privately by the people and made to work. A little town in Texas had something for several years called Christmas in April. All year long the people of that town kept track and watched for homes of elderly people or homes of people that were handicapped or very poor; and if there were things like leaking roofs and plumbing that did not work and so forth, they made a list during all the year. And then on April 1st the merchants that dealt in the products they needed-building materials and paint and so forth-would donate. But citizens of every calling, as volunteers, would show up on that April 1st, knock on the door, and say we are here to put a new roof on your house or paint your house or fix the plumbing or do what has to be done. That went on in that little town in Texas. Well, a couple of years ago, I was amazed to see some people that did not look like ordinary workmen in Washington, DC, nailing shingles on a roof and others painting a porch and so forth. I recognized a couple of judges among them. Believe it or not, Washington, DC, had discovered from that little town in Texas private initiative, and now had Christmas in April for the people, the poor that might be there in the Capital.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheitalianamericanconferenceprivatesectorinitiativesveniceitaly", "title": "Remarks at the Italian-American Conference on Private Sector Initiatives in Venice, Italy", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-italian-american-conference-private-sector-initiatives-venice-italy", "publication_date": "11-06-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I am delighted to be here with all of you today. I do not want to speak too long because Bobbie Kilberg, I think, is next, and she will kill me. But I might say she is doing an outstanding job -- a friend of longstanding and now in an outreach capacity here, high level at the White House, and performing with the expertise that we have come to expect of her. I understand that Secretary Kemp is coming, or maybe -- has he been, or coming over -- and Dick Thornburgh, I think, and our Chief of Staff. So, you will have a full program. I look at these briefing sessions as a two-way street. I hope that you will have a chance to exchange views, get questions and answers with some -- but in any event, an opinion at a forum for sharing of information and ideas. Certainly, the meeting that we had with Abe and those from the organization of presidents was that kind of meeting. And as I look around the room, I see many familiar faces and am delighted to be here. For three quarters of a century, the Anti-Defamation League has played a central role in preserving and protecting that sacred right of religious freedom. And there is no single greater contribution that one organization can make to the Nation, and for that you have earned our gratitude, certainly my respect. From the time the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, the principle of religious freedom and the notion of America as a haven for those who seek to exercise that freedom has been deeply rooted in the American heritage. And our national conscience must take note whenever that freedom is violated, and all Americans then must rush in to the defense of that freedom. As one of our forefathers wrote nearly 200 years ago, the Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance. May the children of the stock of Abraham sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there should be none to make him afraid.

So, we must continue to work together as we have in the past to zealously protect these rights for all Americans. Rest assured that my administration will work to uphold this principle as the very cornerstone of our freedom. And sometimes they question the power of the President, and I understand that. But they should never question the President's willingness to use the bully pulpit of the White House, as Teddy Roosevelt called it, to speak out for what is just and right. I have concentrated today here on just these brief remarks on antidiscrimination or other subjects of enormous concern. I wish you could have been there yesterday in the Oval Office to hear a representative of the Ethiopian Jews, a man who is living in Israel now, make this plea from the heart to continue the flow of the people there who are still not able to join their families in Israel. We had a fascinating meeting with Mr. Arens yesterday where I reassured him of the United States commitment to Israel as a strategic ally and, of course, a lasting friend. And I think he understands that. I hope that when the Prime Minister of Israel comes here that we can move forward in some way toward the peace that everybody here really hopes that Israel and its neighbors will achieve.

The United States-Japanese alliance is one of the linchpins of our security as well as Japan's, and this gives us an opportunity to continue to deepen that relationship, building off the discussions we have had in Washington. It includes the realignment in Okinawa. I want to congratulate Prime Minister Abe on his recent legislation related to bolstering Japanese defense capabilities, and it will give us a chance to talk about a wide range of threats, both regionally and internationally. I also want to express my appreciation for the hard work that Shinzo has been involved with in building up stronger regional understandings. The trilateral meetings that have been taking place between Japan, China, and South Korea I think are especially important. And Shinzo and I both share an interest in continuing to foster rule of law, supporting international norms in areas like navigation-freedom of navigation and maritime law. And again, this bilateral gives us an opportunity to examine how we can work with some of the regional organizations like ASEAN in order to continue to maintain the stability and-that has been the hallmark of this region and has allowed for extraordinary prosperity and growth. And finally, we will be discussing a wide range of economic issues coming out of our meeting at the G-20. Both of us are interested in ratifying and implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has been a major topic of conversation here at APEC and the G-20. There is a recognition that these kinds of high-standard rules that provide enforceable protections for labor and the environment are the wave of the future and could not have been done without Shinzo's leadership. We will also be talking about the climate change conference in Paris, and the importance of all of us working together in order to achieve a strong agreement that can protect the planet for future generations.

We will have a conflict in registration, because we no longer use the branding iron in our country except as ornaments or in our museums.

I have collected some of the irons dating back to my grandfather's day, when he used to drive the cattle up the trail from Johnson City to Abilene. I do not think there was any particular significance to that in those days. But it is interesting that they went from Johnson City to Abilene and I now go out to Walter Reed to see the gentleman from Abilene a good deal. There is a great deal of iron beneath the gold of your gift and I find that symbolic of the purpose that we all share. All across this Nation of ours, there are people good people, prudent people, patriotic people-who know what it means to work and to save and to get ahead. Those people buy savings bonds and Freedom Shares. They hold on to them, because they know it is good for them and good for their country. For 27 years now, we have seen the people's prosperity and the savings bonds program grow hand in hand. So as we meet here this morning, we see a remarkable total of more than $52 billion outstanding that is owned by millions of Americans in all walks of life. Now, I do have a personal problem. I made a commitment to myself to buy a savings bond every month as long as I could, for my grandson. And I am going to have to make another commitment. That is going to involve some problems, because I am going to be out of a job on January 20. I will be out of a job, but I will have another commitment. So I may have to go see Secretary Fowler, who handled monetary problems so well for me, to get his help and judgment on how I can keep up my commitments. But I am going to keep them up, because I believe that you business and labor leaders and 'professional men who have made your own commitments are delivering a great service for this country.

And so I have learned that my great grandfather took off from the village of Ballyporeen in County Tipperary to come to America. And that is not the limit to all that I have learned about that. Some years ago, when I was just beginning in Hollywood in the motion picture business, I had been sentenced for the few years I'd been there to movies that the studio did not want good, it wanted them Thursday. And then came that opportunity that every actor asks for or hopes for, and that was a picture that was going to be made and the biography of the late Knute Rockne, the great immortal coach of Notre Dame. Pat O'Brien was to play Rockne. And there was a part in there that from my own experience as a sports announcer I had long dreamed of, the part of George Gip. And generously, Pat O'Brien, who was then a star at the studio, held out his hand to a young aspiring actor, and I played Gip. Pat playing Rockne, he himself will say, was the high point of his theatrical career. My playing The Gip opened the door to stardom and a better kind of picture. I have been asked at times, What is it like to see yourself in the old movies, the reruns on TV? It is like looking at a son you never knew you had. But I found out in learning about my own heritage, going back to Ballyporeen that, believe it or not, what a small world it is, Pat O'Brien's family came from Ballyporeen. An historian has informed me that our family was one of the four tribes of Tara, and that from the year 200 until about 900 A.D., they defended the only pass through the Slieve Bloom Mountains. They held it for all those centuries and adopted the motto, The Hills Forever. The Hill Forever.

You know, those were not the only jobs that were open to the Irish. Back in the high day of vaudeville, long before sound pictures drove it out, there were, very popular in this country, comedians who would reach great stardom in vaudeville with a broad German accent. German comedians coming on Ach und Himmel Sic der. What is little known in show business is that almost without exception, they were Irish. I was on a mission to England for our government some 10 years ago. I should say to Europe, to several countries, and finally wound up and the last country was Ireland. On the last day in Ireland, I was taken to Cashel Rock. I did not know at that time that it is only 25 miles from Ballyporeen. But I do know that the young Irish guide who was showing us around the ruins of the ancient cathedral, there on the rock, finally took us to the little cemetery. We walked with great interest and looked at those ancient tombstones and the inscriptions. Remember me as you pass by, for as you are, so once was I. But as I am, you too will be, so be content to follow me. To follow you I am content, I wish I knew which way you went.

Some of you were involved in a campaign for the first time, and some of you got involved for the very first time in a very long time, because you believed that we were in a defining moment in our history and that your voice could make a difference. Not a single day goes by where I do not think about all the time and the energy, the money, the commitment, the unyielding faith that you put into our campaign, because it was not just about winning an election, it was about changing a country. Last year, we asked you to take on something new. We asked you to help us keep the promises that we made in the campaign, help to bring about the changes that we had talked about together. And a lot of you have worked hard to do that. You have continued to be engaged in education policy, in foreign policy, and helping us at a grassroots level and continuing to finance our ability to get our message out. It is made the successes of the last year possible. We upheld the principle of equal pay for equal work. We lifted the ban on stem cell research and restored science to its rightful place in America. We provided health care to 4 million children who now have it who did not have it before. We passed the strongest veterans budget in decades.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraiser11", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Fundraiser", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-national-committee-fundraiser-11", "publication_date": "04-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We are working with Congress to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. Oh, by the way, and in the meantime, we prevented the worst financial crisis from getting even worse, turned the economy from contraction to expansion, made the largest investment in clean energy in history, the largest investment in education in decades, expanded the Pell grant program, dealt with a H1N1 virus on the side. That is what your support has helped us do at home. Abroad, we have begun a new era of engagement. We are working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking a world free of them. We are working with other nations to confront climate change. We are now a leader and not a follower in that critical mission. We banned torture. We are rebuilding our military. We are reaffirming our alliances. We have begun to leave Iraq to its own people, as I committed to doing in the campaign. And we have charted a new way forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are making progress every single day in taking the fight to Al Qaida and across the globe. And I went to Cairo on behalf of the American people to begin a new dialogue with the Muslim world. We are living up to our obligations as a wealthy nation, helping to promote food security around the world, helping to deal with diseases around the world. We are living up to a moment that demands American leadership by standing with the people of Haiti as we speak.

I know that is the habit in Washington, but that is not the obligation I owe the American people, that is not the promise I made to you. And because we took bold and swift and coordinated action, we can stand here today and say we averted another depression. We broke the back of the recession. So the worst of the storm has passed. But, as all of you know, the devastation remains. We have got 10 percent unemployment. Many of you watching at home, as you go around the country and your individual communities, you see the stores shuttered and the foreclosed businesses; friends and neighbors, family members who still cannot find work. This is on top of a decade that had been tough for middle class families all across the country. They had not seen their incomes go up in years. Their costs skyrocketing at the same time as their wages were stagnant. For 2 years, I heard stories all across the country, everywhere I go. I heard stories about people trying their best to hold on; a family sitting around the kitchen table wondering if they were going to be able to retire on schedule, if they were going to be able to finance a college education for their kids, wondering when would health care costs stop climbing, when would their premiums start stabilizing. And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the American Dream, was slipping away. That is the reason I ran for ENTITY. That is the reason you supported me. And that is why we are going to continue to do everything we can to create an economy that has not just recovered back to the status quo, but an economy where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded, and where businesses are hiring and wages are rising, and where our middle class is getting stronger and more secure.

We are going to create incentives for consumers to make their homes more energy efficient, creating jobs and saving families money. And we are going to look at our Tax Code, because it is time we ended practices like giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas instead of investing in companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. But the truth is, these steps alone will not make up for 7 million jobs that have been lost over the last 2 years. They are not going to, alone, provide the economic security that is been dwindling for middle class families over the last decade. The only way we do that is to lay a strong foundation for growth over the long term. And the things that we talked about during the campaign are the things that still need to be done. They have been put off by Washington for too long. Change is easy if you are just talking about tinkering around the edges. Change is harder when you actually dig in and try to deal with the structural problems that have impeded our progress for too long. This is where we run headlong into the lobbyists and the special interests and the bitterness and misinformation that characterizes so much of our politics, which means that some of you may be feeling discouraged, because it feels like things have taken longer than you might have expected.

That is why I went to the House Republican caucus the other day. We had a good discussion-- --about the challenges that are facing the American people, our ideas to solve them. That was good for the country. It is good for our democracy. I had fun. Now, there are some issues that Democrats and Republicans are not going to agree on, and that is okay. We are going to tussle from time to time. There may be some issues that we do agree on, or at least we say we agree on. So I told my Republican friends I want to work together with them where I can, and I meant it, because I do not want to just score political points. I have got time to campaign down the road. In the meantime, there is a lot of work that we have got to get done together.

And I want to be clear--there is a lot of talk about Wall Street, Main Street--we need a financial sector that works. We need businesses that are thriving, and they have got to raise capital; that will help them hire workers. That is part of what this crisis has reminded us. But we have got to ensure that our economy is not brought to its knees by outdated and antiquated financial rules and the irresponsibility of a few. And that is why I expect Democrats and Republicans to want to make sure that we do not find ourselves in this same situation again. That is why we have to have financial regulatory reform. And yes, that is why we are going to fix the health care system, a health care system that too often works for insurance companies better than it does for individual Americans.

I am a amateur historian, so I know that seven ENTITYs, starting with Teddy Roosevelt, could not get this done. But I took it on not for its political value; I took it on because families are dealing with skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and insurance companies that routinely deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or drop people altogether when they get sick. We took it on because the costs were killing small businesses and creating an uneven playing field for our international companies, and it was eating into workers' take-home pay and canceling raises. And we took it on because it is the single best way--in fact, the only way--that we are actually going to get control of our Federal budget.

I have said that this is the defining issue of our time, and I mean it. I have said that this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and I believe it. The decisions we make over the next few years will have an enormous impact on the country we live in, and the one we pass on to our children. Right now we are still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Our businesses have created 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months, but we are not creating them fast enough. And we are facing some pretty serious headwinds, the effects of the recent spike in gas prices to the financial crisis in Europe. We have the answers to these problems. We have plenty of big ideas and technical solutions from both sides of the aisle. That is not what is holding us back. What is holding us back is a stalemate in Washington. Last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill full of the kinds of bipartisan ideas that could have put over a million Americans back to work and helped bolster our economy against outside shocks. I sent them a plan that would have reduced our deficit by $4 trillion in a balanced way that pays for the investments we need by cutting unnecessary spending and by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more in taxes. Since then, Congress has passed a few parts of that jobs bill, like a tax cut that is allowing working Americans to keep more of your paycheck every week. But on most of the ideas that would create jobs and grow our economy, Republicans in Congress have not lifted a finger. They'd rather wait until after the election in November. Just this past week, one of them said, Why not wait for the reinforcements? That is a quote, and you can bet plenty of his colleagues are thinking the same thing. This is not about who wins or loses in Washington. This is about your jobs and your paychecks and your children's future.

Whatever has been done that is useful in the party in the last 5 or 6 months he has played a great part in it.

When I look at a group like this, I have no trouble understanding why Bob McNamara is the greatest Secretary of Defense this country has ever had. With women like you working with him, I do not think he could lose. In fact, I would have never started my Fifty Women in Government campaign if I had known that Bob McNamara already had 50 women on this committee, because it looks like he has the market cornered. Someone asked how it is possible for women to understand politics when they have to depend almost entirely on their husbands for political education. Until recently this same question could apply, I guess, to military science. Women could hardly be expected to know anything about the military because they had to depend almost entirely on their husbands for military education, but the world is changing and the times are changing, and so are the services. I want to thank you for your efforts. Military service is becoming an attractive career to women, and we are mighty proud that it is, because it will be a better service, be a better career. And too many people always think, I have observed, of the military in negative terms. We must quit thinking of it just as a force for destruction, or as an instrument for war. A call prompted me the other day, when we were dealing with all the nuclear weapons and the warheads and the bombs and everything, and I thought that might be a good place to have a woman, to sit on the Atomic Energy Commission, because they bring into the world the men who fight the wars and do the dying. So I was able to persuade Dr. Bunting of Radcliffe to come down and she has already been confirmed by the Senate. You women are going to be represented in that field as you are in the military. Now, I think it is a myth we must destroy-about force for destruction and instrument of war. We do not want that to be universally accepted, for in a democracy the armed services have a creative role to play and that creative role must be as an agent of peace.

I think we need more women to play even more important roles. I think you can help encourage that. The Armed Forces faces serious shortages of nurses and dietitians and therapists. Secretary McNamara and I are counting on you to help us find these women and to recruit them. We want you to go out on the highways and the byways and tell the young women of America that this is no longer a stag Government, this is no longer a stag administration, and no longer is there anything like a one-man's army. Tell them it is their Government, it belongs to them, and it is their army, too. We want and we need them, and we urge them to come in.

Today women have become a greater force in the quality of American life. Military life is no exception, and all of us are in your debt for making this possible.

And I want to thank you very much. As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election. And I will tell you, I never thought I'd say it because we had a great election. We had a great election a little while ago. Four years ago, I never thought I'd say anything could compete with 2016. This election that we are going into is the most important election in the history of our country--because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmakeamericagreatagainrallyyumaarizona", "title": "Donald J.

So, we cannot do it. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left-wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America's borders and boundaries. They want to take the wall down, they do not want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want. Can you believe that? Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and, you know, they want to give it to illegal aliens. You do not get it. You do not get it. This is what they want to do. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before. You get free education, you get free healthcare, why would not they come? Let us go to America. The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen. Biden's plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate. It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd. At last night's Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you. They talk about unity. They want to bring unity. And then you listen to Michelle Obama's speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there. She taped it. No, no, she taped the speech. She must have taped it about three weeks before. She could not even-look, number, I'd like to tape, maybe I will tape-I am speaking next Thursday, maybe I will tape it. That is so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air-conditioned room. And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech-you know, they talk about me as being a divider. I bring people together. We were bringing people together. We were bringing people together like never before. Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together.

By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations--they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone's. And they want to spend much less on our military, we have totally rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars, we have totally rebuilt our military. Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream. But if he did, he is been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know. It will have problems; it will go down. And right now, who has a 401k? Alright, and then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way. And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus. Now, NASDAQ just broke an all-time record. SNP just broke an all-time record. Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it is not the mainstream of America.

And, when it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you do not have the supreme court and if you do not have the courts in your side, you can forget it. The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court. They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years. You pick them young. They could be on there for 40 to 50 years. This is going to be the most important, and I never thought I'd say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life. We need every single vote that we can get because it is probably going to be close. They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have these suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Doug and I were talking about it, and they take out registered voters. They say, Most likely to vote voters. That is what, most likely registered, they are dead, they are old, they are not going to go, they are not going to do anything.

I have to admit, I had to restrain myself because this is such an amazing facility, and just wandering around, I started reading about all kinds of American history and that the Dead Sea Scrolls were here. Staff was saying, ENTITY, you have some other stuff that you have to do. There are a couple of acknowledgments that I want to make. First of all, you have got one of the best mayors in the country, Mayor Michael Nutter is here. You have got a couple of the finest Members of Congress in Bob Brady and Chaka Fattah. And you have got somebody here who is been one of my dearest friends and one of my favorite people who has always had my back, and he and I share a lot in common. We are both--we both pretend to play basketball, even though we are way too old. We both married up and we both have extraordinary daughters. He happens also to be one of the best Members of the Senate that we have. Bob Casey is in the house. So I am here not just because I need your help, although I do. I am here because the country needs your help. When you think back to 2008, a lot of you were involved in that campaign. You did not get involved because you thought ENTITY was the odds-on favorite to become President of the United States. Let us face it. the idea that if you are willing to work hard, if you are willing to take responsibility, that in this country you can make it; that you can find a job that pays a living wage and you can save and buy a home. You can send your kids to college so they do even better than you did. You can retire with some dignity and some respect. The idea that no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, no matter what your faith, no matter who you love, that in America you can make it if you try. It is that idea that builds the broadest middle class in the history of the world--and that was and has been the strength of America, the backbone of America--is that everybody had a shot.

We put two wars on a credit card. Our economy increasingly was built on financial speculation and a housing bubble. Manufacturing was leaving our shores. And although a few people were doing really, really well, that broad-based middle class that built this country, that was the essence of this country, found themselves--you found yourselves--in a situation where wages, incomes were flatlining and job growth was the most sluggish it had been in 50, 60 years and the cost of everything from health care to college education kept on going up and up and up. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Three million jobs lost in the 6 months before I took office, while we were campaigning, 800,000 jobs lost the month that I was sworn into office. And so we had to make a series of tough decisions and decisive decisions and quick decisions, and we had to do it without much help from the other side. But the thing that gave me confidence throughout was what I had learned about the American people as I traveled all across the country--and it is a great privilege just running for President and obviously a greater privilege being President because you meet Americans from every walk of life and they show you their grit and they show you their determination. And it turns out Americans are tougher than any tough times. And so when some people said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, we decided, no, we are going to make a bet on the American worker and American industry. And because of the actions that we took, GM is back on top, and we are seeing the auto industry rehiring and producing better cars than ever. We helped to stabilize the financial system so small businesses could get help again and get credit and financing flowing again. Businesses got back to basics, and we created 4.3 million jobs over the last 27 months, 800,000 this year alone. So we have made progress.

And as a consequence, we have got millions of students who are benefiting from higher Pell grants; more kids are eligible. We are able to make sure that we can cap the amount of money that folks have to pay back each month on their student loans, because we recognized that a higher education cannot be a luxury.

Even after you factor in all the work that we did to prevent us from slipping into a depression, the pace of growth of Government spending is lower under my administration than it has been in the last 50 years. The two Presidents with the least growth in Government spending in the modern era happen to be two Democrats named ENTITY and Bill Clinton. And now you have got Mr. Romney proposing a $5 trillion tax cut. either it is not paid for, in which case, that is $5 trillion that is piled on top of the debt we already have, passed onto the next generation, or it is going to come from middle class families all across this country. And I am running for President because we are not going to let that happen. We are not going to allow another millionaires' tax cut to result in cuts in basic research and science, and cuts in Head Start programs, and less help to States and cities who are putting folks back to work. We are not going to have poor and disabled and seniors who rely on Medicaid having to bear the brunt for another millionaires' tax cut. We are not going to voucherize Medicare. We have got to do something about the debt and deficits, and the way to do it is by making sure that, yes, we go after waste in Government. But what we do have to make sure of is that we do it in a balanced way. So, even as we are paring back on things that do not work--and I have already signed $2 trillion of cuts into law already and have proposed $2 trillion in additional deficit reduction--even as we are making sensible cuts, even as we are reforming our health care system to make sure that the dollars we pay actually make us healthier, what we are not going to do is to make the most vulnerable people in our society, as well as the middle class, shoulder the burden.

America is a much younger nation, but we have made our mark by advancing ideals as old as the pyramids. Those ideals of liberty and justice have sparked a revolution across much of the world. This hopeful movement made its way to places where dictators once reigned and peaceful democracies seemed unimaginable, places like Chile and Indonesia and Poland and the Philippines and South Korea. These nations have different histories and different traditions, yet each made the same democratic transition, and they did it on their own terms. In these countries, millions every year are rising from poverty. Women are realizing overdue opportunities. And people of faith are finding the blessing of worshiping God in peace. All these changes took place in the second half of the 20th century. I strongly believe that if leaders, like those of you in this room, act with vision and resolve, the first half of the 21st century can be the time when similar advances reach the Middle East.

It is capable of a very bright future, a future in which the Middle East is a place of innovation and discovery driven by free men and women. In recent years, we have seen hopeful beginnings toward this vision. Turkey, a nation with a majority Muslim population, is a prosperous, modern democracy. Afghanistan, under the leadership of President Karzai, is overcoming the Taliban and building a free society.

From diversifying your economies to investing in your people to extending the reach of freedom, nations across the region have an opportunity to move forward with bold and confident reforms and to lead the Middle East to its rightful place as a center of progress and achievement. This is a time of strength for many of your nations' economies. Since 2004, economic growth in the region has averaged more than 5 percent. And unemployment rates have decreased in many nations. Egypt, for example, has posted strong economic growth, developed some of the world's fastest growing telecommunications companies, and made major investments that will boost tourism and trade. In order for this economic progress to result in permanent prosperity and an Egypt that reaches its full potential, however, economic reform must be accompanied by political reform. And I continue to hope that Egypt can lead the region in political reform. This is also a time to prepare for the economic changes ahead. Rising price of oil has brought great wealth to some in this region, but the supply of oil is limited, and nations like mine are aggressively developing alternatives to oil. Over time, as the world becomes less dependent on oil, nations in the Middle East will have to build more diverse and more dynamic economies. Your greatest asset in this quest is the entrepreneurial spirit of your people. The best way to take advantage of that spirit is to make reforms that unleash individual creativity and innovation. Your economies will be more vibrant when citizens who dream of starting their own companies can do so quickly, without high regulatory and registration costs. Your economies will be more dynamic when property rights are protected and risk-taking is encouraged, not punished, by law. Your economies will be more resilient when you adopt modern agricultural techniques that make farmers more productive and the food supply more secure. And your economies will have greater long-term prosperity when taxes are low and all your citizens know that their innovation and hard work will be rewarded. One of the most powerful drivers of economic growth is free trade. So nations in this region would benefit greatly from breaking down barriers to trade with each other. And America will continue working to open up trade at every level. In recent years, the United States has completed free trade agreements with Jordan, Oman, Morocco, and Bahrain.

And to break down trade barriers and ignite economic growth around the world, we will work tirelessly for a successful outcome to the Doha round this year. As we seek to open up new markets abroad, America will keep our markets open at home. There are voices in my country that urge America to adopt measures that would isolate us from the global economy. I firmly reject these calls for protectionism. We will continue to welcome foreign investment and trade. And the United States of America will stay open for business. Some analysts believe the Middle East and North Africa will need to create up to 100 million new jobs over the next 10 to 15 years just to keep up with population growth. The key to realizing this goal is an educated workforce. This starts early on, with primary schools that teach basic skills such as reading and math rather than indoctrinating children with ideologies of hatred. An educated workforce also requires good high schools and universities where students are exposed to a variety of ideas, learn to think for themselves, and develop the capacity to innovate. Not long ago, the region marked a hopeful milestone in higher education. In our meeting yesterday, President Karzai told me he recently handed out diplomas to university graduates, including 300 degrees in medicine and 100 degrees in engineering and a lot of degrees to lawyers. And many of the recipients were women. The people of the Middle East can count on the United States to be a strong partner in improving your educational systems. We are sponsoring training programs for teachers and administrators in nations like Jordan and Morocco and Lebanon. We sponsored English language programs where students can go for intensive language instruction. We have translated more than 80 children's books into Arabic. We have developed new online curricula for students from kindergarten through high school.

This is a matter of morality and of basic math. No nation that cuts off half its population from opportunities will be as productive or prosperous as it could be. Women are a formidable force, as I have seen in my own family and my own administration. As the nations of the Middle East open up their laws and their societies to women, they are learning the same thing. I applaud Egypt. Egypt is a model for the development of professional women. In Afghanistan, girls who were once denied even a basic education are now going to school, and a whole generation of Afghans will grow up with the intellectual tools to lead their nation toward prosperity. In Iraq and in Kuwait, women are joining political parties and running campaigns and serving in public office. In some Gulf States, women entrepreneurs are making a living and a name for themselves in the business world. Recently, I learned of a woman in Bahrain who owns her own shipping company. She started with a small office and two employees. When she first tried to register her business in her own name, she was turned down. She attended a business training class and was the only woman to participate. And when she applied for a customs license, officials expressed surprise because no woman had ever asked for one before. And yet with hard work and determination, she turned her small company into a $2 million enterprise. And this year, Huda Janahi was named one of the 50 most powerful businesswomen in the Arab world. Huda is an inspiring example for the whole region. You have a great deal to contribute; you should have a strong voice in leading your countries; and my Nation looks to the day when you have the rights and privileges you deserve.

In Afghanistan, 8 million people defied the terrorist threats to vote for a democratic President. In Iraq, 12 million people waved ink-stained fingers to celebrate the first democratic election in decades. There are people who claim that democracy is incompatible with Islam. But the truth is that democracies, by definition, make a place for people of religious belief. America is one of the most is one of the world's leading democracies, and we are also one of the most religious nations in the world. More than three-quarters of our citizens believe in a higher power. Millions worship every week and pray every day, and they do so without fear of reprisal from the state. In our democracy, we would never punish a person for owning a Koran. We would never issue a death sentence to someone for converting to Islam. Democracy does not threaten Islam or any religion. Democracy is the only system of government that guarantees their protection. Some say any state that holds an election is a democracy. But true democracy requires vigorous political parties allowed to engage in free and lively debate. True democracy requires the establishment of civic institutions that ensure an election's legitimacy and hold leaders accountable. And true democracy requires competitive elections in which opposition candidates are allowed to campaign without fear or intimidation. Too often in the Middle East, politics has consisted of one leader in power and the opposition in jail. America is deeply concerned about the plight of political prisoners in this region as well as democratic activists who are intimidated or repressed, newspapers and civil society organizations that are shut down, and dissidents whose voices are stifled. The time has come for nations across the Middle East to abandon these practices and treat their people with dignity and the respect they deserve.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheworldeconomicforumsharmelsheikh", "title": "George W.

The vision I have outlined today is shared by many in this region, but unfortunately, there are some spoilers who stand in the way. Terrorist organizations and their state sponsors know they cannot survive in a free society, so they create chaos and take innocent lives in an effort to stop democracy from taking root. They are on the wrong side in a great ideological struggle, and every nation committed to freedom and progress in the Middle East must stand together to defeat them. We must stand with the Palestinian people, who have suffered for decades and earned the right to be a homeland of their own to have a homeland of their own. I strongly support a two-state solution, a democratic Palestine based on law and justice that will live with peace and security alongside a democrat Israel. I believe that the Palestinian people will build a thriving democracy in which entrepreneurs pursue their dreams, and families own their homes in lively communities, and young people grow up with hope in the future. Last year at Annapolis, we made a hopeful beginning toward a peace negotiation that will outline what this nation of Palestine will look like, a contiguous state where Palestinians live in prosperity and dignity. A peace agreement is in the Palestinians' interests, it is in Israel's interests, it is in Arab States' interests, and it is in the world's interests. And I firmly believe that with leadership and courage, we can reach that peace agreement this year. It requires action on all sides. Palestinians must fight terror and continue to build the institutions of a free and peaceful society. Israel must make tough sacrifices for peace and ease the restrictions on the Palestinians. Arab States, especially oil-rich nations, must seize this opportunity to invest aggressively in the Palestinian people and to move past their old resentments against Israel. And all nations in the region must stand together in confronting Hamas, which is attempting to undermine efforts at peace with acts of terror and violence. We must stand with the people of Lebanon in their struggle to build a sovereign and independent democracy. This means opposing Hizballah terrorists, funded by Iran, who recently revealed their true intentions by taking up arms against the Lebanese people. It is now clearer than ever that Hizballah militias are the enemy of a free Lebanon.

Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone. Wages in your state, New Mexico, are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago.

We will take $16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number. We are going to give it to the farmers, so that they are even. And I tell you, the farmers do love ENTITY, they do love ENTITY. And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children. Now, if you do not like your children, do not do it. But when it is your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, they are taking care of you. You really love them. If you do not love them, do not even listen to the last line, because it will not matter. If they are not good, leave it to charity. I know a guy who cannot stand his children, they are horrible, horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, Why would you leave them? They do not even like you. But on the assumption that you love your children, you will be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. You will be able to leave them to your children. Your children will not have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They will not be losing it to the banks five years later. We got rid of it.

But in the meantime, we are doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people are not getting through. It is really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another.

You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it is much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for? And we are trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that they are less safe. So, what I want to do is the following.

The National Guard, as my colleague from Virginia was talking about, they kept this place from being burned down. They kept people from getting killed. They lost their lives on that day and in subsequent days because of the trauma that they were exposed to. They suffered racial epithets that nobody in America should have to suffer shouted in the halls of this Capitol. And there are people here, as my colleague from Wisconsin said, who are claiming that they were acting like tourists. I just heard somebody downstairs in the basement walking by and they were pointing out one of those pictures that is down there of newsboys standing in front of the Capitol when they were kids. Because this place, for the people that work here -- I am not talking about the Senate, but the people that work here that are the staff, whose grandparents worked here, whose great uncles are on the pictures downstairs. To them, this is a family. It was assaulted on behalf of people that came summoned here by the president who claimed that the election had been stolen from him, who was perpetrating a big lie about what had happened in the election. And it is tragic that a year later, we still have to come here and say, Joe Biden won the election. And he did by any fair study of what happened that day on election day. He won Arizona by 10,000 votes. He won Georgia by 11,000 votes. He won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes. He won Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes, in Michigan by 150,000 votes. In every one of those swing states, he won by more votes than Donald Trump won in his election against Hillary Clinton. This margin was bigger in those states, except Arizona, than the margin that Donald Trump had won when he won the election against Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden won this election by 7 million votes.

They did not actually vote, they were dead, but people cast ballots on behalf of them. Four people out of 5 million and one of those cast a vote for Donald Trump. But President Trump continues to say that there were dead people voting all over the United States of America. The Associated Press did a review of all those swing states that I was mentioning earlier, and they found that if you just looked at the disputed ballots -- so these are not even fraudulent ballots, because they have not been identified as fraudulent, they are just disputed ballots -- that in all these cases, the disputed ballots came to about .15% of the margin in any one of these races. In other words, in not a single one of these swing states where there is a dispute that President Trump has brought, would it make a material difference, even if it were true, what you are alleging. And he is still doubled down on the big lie. And the result of that is, as my colleagues have said here today, there are more than 400 bills nationwide, in the name of that big lie, making it harder for the American people to vote, making it harder for them to register, making it harder for people to vote early, or to vote by mail. In Texas, they are down to one dropbox per county. In Colorado, I can practically cross my street and vote at a dropbox. This is an effort to subvert elections to cling to power. And it is based on a massive falsehood -- the big lie. I think one needs to ask oneself, even people that support President Trump, what future does the stop the steal movement imagine for our country? What future do they imagine for this democracy where every election is going to be contested? Where political violence replaces the ballot box.

I always have to say, especially when the senator from Minnesota is around, that we are number two in terms of voter turnout, Minnesota is number one, but we are coming for you.

Since August of 1961, more than a dozen labor areas of Illinois have been taken off the list of areas of substantial unemployment -including your own great city of Peoria. I understand that a man who works in the Unemployment Compensation Service is afraid if things keep on going this way, he will be out of a job pretty soon. Yes, you are rebuilding Peoria. You have a positive program. You stand for something. You are not just a bunch of negative aginers. The excitement of rebirth is everywhere in this city. You can see it. You can feel it.

None of this has happened by accident. It has happened because you had the vision to rebuild your city. It happened because your State and National Governments have pursued policies that made progress possible, policies that insured economic growth. Let me give you just one example. The biggest tax cut in American history, recommended by our late beloved, martyred President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and supported by most of the men in the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, was enacted by the Congress. In that tax bill we reduced the tax bill of the average taxpayer by 20 percent. We created 130,000 new jobs in Illinois. We generated an increase in total Illinois income of $2 billion. We boosted State and local tax revenues by $160 million. We cut Illinois withholding tax payments by $500 million. Four years ago the mighty industrial and agricultural center of Illinois was stalled on dead center. Today, Illinois is on the move, and we intend to keep Illinois moving forward.

The Illinois AFL-CIO State convention meeting here in Peoria has fought for social security. He was one of the architects of the Social Security Act of 1935, and through the years he has been its staunchest friend.

And I want to thank you for serving the Red Cross. And speaking about the Red Cross, the International Red Cross is doing heroic work in a part of the world that has suffered incredible, incredible death and destruction. The American people express our sympathy to the victims of the tsunami disasters. Yesterday I spoke to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, who I sent on a delegation with a delegation to assess the relief operations. And they reported in that the devastation is beyond comprehension. They also reported in that they will come back with an assessment about how we can more effectively help. But they also reported that our military is doing heroic work in helping to save life. They are flying rescue missions 24 hours a day. They are making a huge difference in the people's lives over there by delivering supplies directly to those in need. Our Government has not only stepped up with the use of military assets, but we have pledged $350 million in disaster assistance to help the people over there who are suffering. As you know, I tapped a couple of ex-President's number 41 and number 42, to help out. I asked them to help, and they are. My dad and President Clinton have graciously given of their time to help make sure that people know there is a need and to make sure the donations are properly channeled into programs that work. If you want to help, get on the Internet for the USA www.usafreedomcorps.gov. And on that web page, you will find different agencies which are doing the good work. What I do not want is, I do not want people to be sending money to places that are not really doing the job. We do not need to support organizations that are not effectively delivering compassion and help.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

We are going to continue to work with our farmers and ranchers to make sure they can sell the products overseas, in markets where people need food and beef and pork. We are going to work to pass a national energy plan. We are going to work to cut our deficit in half over the next 5 years. And I look forward to working with members of both political parties to do something about our health care system. First, it is important for Americans to understand we have the best health care system in the world. And we need to keep it that way. We have got the best hospitals, both urban and rural. We have got the world's most talented and compassionate doctors and nurses. And we have got the world's and we lead the world in innovative research. We are on the cutting edge of change. We are saving lives through our research. Americans should be proud of our medical system, and we all must be grateful for those who work hard to provide compassion and care.

{"id": 5444, "text": "The cost of health care is rising rapidly, and that burdens our families. It hurts our small businesses. It makes it harder for the job creators to expand the job base. Too many Americans are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we have got to take those steps this year. To improve health care in America, we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It is a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do. To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply 21st century information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our Medicare system still allows seniors to have choice in the system. We have got to make sure we expand community health centers around our country to provide care for the poor and the indigent. And we have got to make sure low-income children are enrolled in government health care programs so they receive the care they need. These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by the Federal Government but by patients and doctors. To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. And that is what the American people must understand and Members of the United States Senate and the United States House must understand. Many of the costs that we are talking about do not start in an examining room or an operating room; they start in a courtroom.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 5445, "text": "What is happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in recent years. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system today. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients. When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern Illinois and the people of America must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine.

{"id": 5446, "text": "In 2003, almost half of all American hospitals lost physicians or reduced services because of medical liability concerns. One-half of all American hospitals lost physicians. Over the past 2 years, the liability crisis has forced out about 160 physicians in Madison and St. Clair counties alone. the patients, the people who live in these good towns in this part of the world. Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose critical minutes in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. America's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains some 60 to 100 billion dollars from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand. This liability system of ours is, what I am telling you, is out of control. And you have people in this area and the doctors in this area understand what I am talking about. A recent study ranked Madison County the number one place in the country for trial lawyers to sue. And those of you traveling in from St. Clair County are not doing much better. Clair is ranked the second county in America where you are likely to get sued. In other words, if you see a team of trial lawyers spending a lot of time in the Collinsville area, you can be pretty sure they are not looking for horseradish.

A few years ago, Chris decided that closing his head trauma part of his practice was the only way he could afford to stay in this area. He told me he loves living here in this part of the world. He likes to raise his family here. He and his wife made a tough decision to stay here, in spite of the fact that his premiums doubled and he got half the coverage. And so the only way he could stay here and to provide a level of care that he wants everybody to have was to cut out part of his practice. He still treats dozens of patients with spinal cord injuries, but now brain trauma victims in southern Illinois have to be airlifted across the river to St. Louis.

This is a story of pregnant moms all over America who are wondering whether or not they are going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, one, I understand the problem and I intend to work with Congress to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of Texas, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. One is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the State that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from one area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from one area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your Federal budget spends $28 billion a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for Medicaid and Medicare and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to Congress with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, 100 percent of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages.

{"id": 5450, "text": "But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, the State of California has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in 1975. Patients in that State see their claims settled a third faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since 1975, insurance premiums for California doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most States. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the Congress ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, Congress needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. 160 docs leave 2 counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on election day about medical liability. The House passed a good medical liability reform bill last year. I want to thank the two Members of Congress for working on it. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the American people. Both Houses will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the House to get the bill moving. It is important for the United States Senators from this State and other States to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in the year 2005.

{"id": 5451, "text": "The lawsuit burden falls especially hard on small businesses. And yet small businesses are the engine of job are the engines of job creation in our country. Seventy percent of all new jobs in America are created by small businesses. The tort costs in America are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for American manufacturers and entrepreneurs. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in Madison County. The number of class actions filed here increased by over 5,000 percent between 1998 and 2003, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from Madison County. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed . I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the Congress this year. I will also work with Congress to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern Illinois and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of dozens of companies and cost tens of thousands of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. Congress has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in 2005. I think we are sent to Washington to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Congresses. I believe we are called to do the hard work to make our communities and quality of life a better place. And it is hard work for some in Congress to stand up to the trial lawyers. I understand that. And most of all, we want the patients and the American people treated fairly.

Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods.

So but I was nice, because we are having a very strong negotiation, which if it were not for tariffs and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position. But in my case, it cannot , because it is true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. We have lost so much money with China $500 billion a year. And on trade, it is such a disaster; it is $507 billion a year. We lose with everybody, almost. I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that have not done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country as it is turned out, because it is now been on there for a long while. Our and I am in no rush because I am fine with it. I am fine with it. Of the 25 points, we have paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. You know, everyone said, Oh, it is a tax on our It is not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate.

We cannot keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. When a tree falls, you cannot let the environmentalist say you cannot take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree. It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he does not mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently let us say four weeks ago or so.

Their radical government-run plan if you call it that would lead to colossal tax increases increases like you have never seen before and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. And we have some great private coverage, and we have initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal.

They went to the bathroom. And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we are now the leader in the world. We are the biggest now in the world because of moves that I have made. And we are trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We need pipeline approval.

We cannot afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that is going to be good for us in 2020. They are embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I do not think I have ever heard, in Virginia, the governor a Democrat stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside. He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he will talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they did not want the child, who is now outside of the womb long outside of the womb they will execute the baby after birth. They will execute the baby after birth. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it.

{"id": 5510, "text": "Today I want to talk to you about our Nation's duty to ensure that all America's seniors can enjoy their golden years as healthy as modern medicine will allow. I want to talk about my plan to strengthen and modernize Medicare and the important steps we can take to encourage older Americans to undergo health screenings that can save their lives and improve the quality of their lives. For 34 years now, Medicare has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. Last month at the White House, I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for the 21st century. The plan will strengthen Medicare by controlling cost, promoting competition, and dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to keeping the Trust Fund solvent until the year 2027. And my plan will modernize Medicare by matching its benefits to the latest advances of modern medicine. Since Medicare's founding in 1965, a medical revolution has transformed health care in America. Once the cure for many illnesses was a scalpel; now, just as likely, it is a pharmaceutical. That is why I made helping seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical care a key part of the Medicare plan. But even as we modernize Medicare with the prescription drug benefit, we also must modernize Medicare's preventive care benefits. Today, doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases earlier and more effectively than ever. And for millions, early detection can mean the difference between a full recovery and a bleak prognosis. For instance, if prostate cancer is caught early, the survival rate is 99 percent; but if it is not , the rate can be a discouraging 31 percent. In 1997 we worked across party lines to expand Medicare coverage for preventive services. But too few seniors still are using this benefit. Last year just one in seven older women received a mammogram covered by Medicare. For many seniors on fixed incomes, who every day must struggle to pay for food, rent, and other necessities, the cost of even a modest copayment can be prohibitive, and that can cost lives. It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its screenings might have avoided. No one should have to undergo a dangerous surgical procedure that could have been prevented by a simple test. No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care they need.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress121", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-121", "publication_date": "10-07-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

It was some sixty-four years ago that this institution was first established under a man of great eminence alike in the work of pedagogy and in other fields- Professor Biggs. At the time when it was started the public-school system of the United States had begun and was in the process of its first development. The development of the high school, especially during the last half century, has been literally phenomenal. Nothing like our present system of education was known in earlier times. No such system of popular education for the people by the representatives of the people existed. It is, of course, a mere truism to say that the stability and future welfare of our institutions of government depend upon the grade of citizenship turned out from our public schools. And no body of public servants, no body of individuals associated in private life, are better worth the admiration and respect of all who value citizenship at its true worth, than the body composed of the teachers in the public schools throughout the length and breadth of this Union. They have to deal with citizenship in the raw and turn it out something like a finished product. I think that all of us who also endeavor to deal with that citizenship in the raw in our own homes appreciate the burden and the responsibility. The training given in the public schools must, of course, be not merely a training in intellect, but a training in what counts for infinitely more than intellect-a training in character. And the chief factor in that training must be the personal equation of the teachers; the influence exerted, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, by the man or woman who stands in so peculiar a relation to the boys and girls under his or her care-a relation closer, more intricate, and more vital in its after-effects than any other relation save that of parent and child. Wherever a burden of that kind is laid, those who carry it necessarily carry a great responsibility. Scant should be our patience with any man or woman doing a bit of work vitally worth doing, who does not approach it in the spirit of sincere love for the work, and of desire to do it well for the work's sake.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthededicatoryexercisesthenewhighschoolbuildingphiladelphiapennsylvania", "title": "Remarks at the Dedicatory Exercises of the New High School Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-dedicatory-exercises-the-new-high-school-building-philadelphia-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "22-11-1902", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Theodore Roosevelt"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The man or woman in public or private life who ever works only for the sake of the reward that comes outside of the work, will in the long run do poor work. The man or woman who does work worth doing is the man or woman who lives, who breathes that work; with whom it is ever present in his or her soul; whose ambition is to do it well and to feel rewarded by the thought of having done it well. That man, that woman, puts the whole country under an obligation.

I especially want to thank these uniformed officers who give their lives to make our lives safer and all the community citizens groups who work with them. Ladies and gentlemen, when I came to California and to San Diego 4 years ago and I listened and attempted to learn what was going on here, I saw an enormous amount of potential and a lot of stress.

Anyway, what we tried to do was to develop a serious approach, to work with you, to help you seize control of your destiny, and to help you do more of what you were already inclined to do.

Because we are building two new ships for our national defense, the San Diego shipyards are busy, securing another 4,000 jobs until the year 2000. Because in 1993 and 1994 the Congress agreed to invest in defense conversion, in high technology research and development and new environmental technologies and biotechnology, jobs are being created here that have a real future to grow in number and to strengthen and diversify the economy of this area.

The Attorney General talked about some of the progress we have made. She gave me a report today which reviews where we are and what we have done. So as we have worked hard to bring the crime rate down all over America, we have made special efforts in our border communities, because we know that we have special responsibilities there. They have to be enforced, and the consequences of their enforcement or their failure to be enforced have to be borne primarily by the National Government. I have done what I could to get more money into California in very difficult fiscal circumstances in Washington to help you deal with the costs of illegal immigration-more than ever before- and I will continue to work on that. I agreed with what the district attorney said when he said there is a difference in being a safer community and a safe community. I agreed with what the sheriff said when he said that we'd never fully solve this problem until both the United States and our friends in Mexico are working together in a long-term and consistent way. But think about how far we have come in the last 3 1/2 years. Three and a half years ago, many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in America would return the very next day to commit crimes again. For a lot of years people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but did not do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words. It is a pretty good practice in a lot of areas of life, and I think it is worked pretty well here. We will work with you to give you the tools you need to patrol your streets, protect your children, secure our common border. And you have to do what you can to help the police to bring the crime rate down and make your community safe. San Diego has the 5th lowest crime rate in the country of the 75 biggest urban areas.

I want to say too, again, I am glad that we are working to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America, that we are putting community policing in every community in the country that is willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it. Today I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the San Diego citizens patrol in the Safe Streets Now program. So I ask you, do not stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you are surprised when you hear about a crime, then you will know you have got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it. The second thing we are doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they do not belong here in the first place, they are being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of January of last year, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem. We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We have added Border Patrol agents, in San Diego alone increasing by 762 the number of agents who are working for you by the end of this year. In El Paso, our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. Here in San Diego, control has been taken back of Imperial Beach from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built miles of new fences, installed thousands of watts of new lighting. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing San Diego residents in East County, particularly with the onset of the fire season.

{"id": 5525, "text": "Let me say one final word of appreciation here to the cooperation between the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials. What they have done here today, over the last several months-I mean, it ought to be something that we all take for granted. It ought to be the rule in every jurisdiction in America. And I tell you, that is what we are trying to create for all the citizens of the United States, wherever they live. And I am very proud of what they have done. They have put aside politics and put the people of this community first, their safety first, their future first. That is why there has been an 84 percent increase in felony drug prosecutions in one year. That is why murders and robberies and car thefts have dropped so much, because they are all working together and working for you, instead of protecting their turf and playing politics. And I say, God bless them, we need more like them all over this country. Let me just say one other thing that affects Americans a long way from you, but I bet you have all identified with them in the past few months. Even as we crack down on illegal immigration and do more than has ever been done before on that, we must never forget that we are all a nation of immigrants and, except for the Native Americans, we all came from somewhere else. Our incredible diversity is a source of our rich potential as we move into this global society. Anybody who is willing to work hard, obey the law, respect their neighbors, and follow the values inherent in the Constitution ought to have a chance in America, and that ought to be the rule here. And because we are people and because we are imperfect, the country will always have problems. But we really fall into a dangerous trap when we start blaming our problems on other people just because they are different from us. I say that because even though I am a long way from there, my heart has been in my native South for the last several weeks as we have dealt with this incredible rash of church burnings. That is just another way of people finding a way-trying to blame somebody else or put down somebody else or put distance between them and someone else in a totally dehumanizing way, forgetting that everybody should be treated equally before the law, in the eyes of our fellow Americans, just as we are before God Almighty. Just 2 days ago, I reported to the American people about what we were doing to deal with the church bombings.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia", "title": "Remarks to the Community in San Diego, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-community-san-diego-california", "publication_date": "10-06-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And thanks to the 11 leaders in this room, I think that the expression will become the story of this incredible initiative. I want to congratulate you on the great job you have done. This region has special significance to me because, as you know, my wife, is from Slovenia. We spoke about it. And she loves Slovenia. Every one of your nations has an inspiring story. You have overcame years of oppression, and you all are united by the hope that your citizens will flourish, your commerce will prosper, and your countries will absolutely thrive. That is what is going to happen, because I know the people. This is the spirit of hope that brings us all together. We are here at this historic gathering to launch a new future for open, fair, and affordable energy markets that bring greater security and prosperity to all of our citizens. We are sitting on massive energy, and we are now exporters of energy. So one of you need energy, just give us a call. On behalf of the American people, let me say that we stand with the Three Seas nations. We support your drive for greater prosperity and security. We applaud your initiative to expand infrastructure. We welcome this historic opportunity to deepen our economic partnership with your region. It is been 28 years since your brave citizens lifted the Iron Curtain and defeated communism, yet much of the infrastructure within Central and Eastern Europe has remained a relic of the old Soviet era. Your people have been held back by the old roads, railways, and pipelines that still operate on restrictive systems. The Three Seas Initiative will transform and rebuild the entire region and ensure that your infrastructure, like your commitment to freedom and rule of law, binds you to all of Europe and, indeed, to the West. The United States also strongly supports the creation of the Three Seas Business Forum so that your countries can build cutting-edge projects with the best talent in the energy industry, and do so under budget and ahead of schedule. under budget and ahead of schedule. New energy infrastructure is essential to this rebuilding effort. We hope that the Three Seas nations will advance the same goals we are working on to achieve for our people in America.

We are adding many billions of dollars of brandnew equipment. We have taken off restrictions, and people are really moving hard. So when I say that the stock market is at an alltime high, we have picked up in market value almost $4 trillion since November 8, which was the election. Four trillion dollars, it is a lot of money. Personally, I picked up nothing, but that is all right. Greater access to energy markets, fewer barriers to energy trade and development and strengthening energy security is what we are looking to do. The Three Seas Initiative has the potential to accomplish all of these essential objectives and very quickly because you have incredible people, and they will get it done quickly. I congratulate your nations for already beginning the critical projects that open us up to greater access, and you will be totally open and have access to energy markets and remove barriers to energy trade, such as floating LNG terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. Did you ever hear of that? You know all about that. I will bet you know all about it. These projects and many others are crucial to ensuring that your nations continue to diversify your energy sources, suppliers, and routes. I also applaud Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Austria for pursuing a pipeline from the Black Sea. We just approved a big pipeline also, the Keystone Pipeline. It was under consideration for many, many years, and it was dead, and I approved it in my first day of office. And it is now under construction. The United States is proud to see that our abundant energy resources are already helping the Three Seas nations achieve much-needed energy diversification. In fact, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and people of Poland for receiving their first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas last month. And you made a very good deal, I understand. The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so.

The United States supports a commonsense approach to protecting natural resources, one that responsibly balances economic growth, job creation, and energy security. We invite all countries to work with us to achieve this objective and to develop innovative technologies that empower nations around the world to be faithful stewards of their natural resources, while lifting millions out of poverty and into great and beautiful futures. The Three Seas Initiative will not only empower your people to prosper, but it will ensure that your nations remain sovereign, secure, and free from foreign coercion.

This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America. Our Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam. Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you. It just must be the center of our concerns. But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people. This Nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home. And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight. I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year. I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty. I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth. I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America. I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins. I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal system from prevention to probation. I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.

Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do. We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it. We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society. Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion. Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years. Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8 billion. On a cash basis which is the way that you and I keep our family budget the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus. That is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government next year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967.

I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans. Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor? Time may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make them.

{"id": 2919, "text": "The major obstacle to peace is the settlement activities. Would you request from Prime Minister Olmert a freeze on the settlements? I think the major obstacle to peace is going to be the politics of both Palestinians and Israelis trying to take advantage of the difficult work that these two leaders are going to have to do to define a state; that is what I think. I think that extremists, in some instances, will try to stop the peace. I believe there is a lot of forces at play in Israel that will try to stop these two men from defining what a state will look like. And my job is to help them stay on the big picture and have the confidence necessary to make tough decisions. But there is a mechanism to deal with that, and that is the roadmap commission, for the best word-is the trilateral commission, which we head, to deal with these roadmap issues. Now, we can solve those-we can work through those problems, but the key is to define a state. And the reason I believe it is because these two men, with whom I have spent a fair amount of time, are committed. The state will come into being subject to a roadmap. But the first step is to define what is possible; here is what a state will look like. And that is very important for both the Palestinians and the Israelis. Well, the key is for me to convince the two leaders to work through the hard issues. I will help them, but in order for there to be lasting peace, they have got to come to the table; they have got to negotiate it. And what ends up happening in this process is that the leaders will commit, and then they will get their committees to work, and it gets stuck. And that is when I will have to work with Condi Rice to unstick it, just to keep it moving. One thing is, is that they know that they have got a good partner in peace in me. They also know that I am not going to be in office a year from now, so there is a certain urgency to get this state defined. And my trip is going to be to just kind of keep momentum. One, it was a chance for the Palestinians and the Israelis to know that the United States is serious about helping them, and equally importantly, it gave the world a chance to come to the table.

And I am going to want to know- and I am going to tell them, yes, I am, but we expect you to be constructive players too. Exactly, but, I mean, can you elaborate a little bit about this? I mean, what more can you do? But you see, to get it to this place-I mean, a visit is important, but I am on the phone a lot, and Condi is on the phone a lot. And there is a reason why the timing of this visit is what it is. I mean, there was an intifada when I first came into office. I mean, I supported it as the first American President ever to support it. The Israelis, under Ariel Sharon, came to the conclusion that this is in their interests.

What would you want to do to win hearts and minds of the Palestinians, to assure them that the United States is a fair broker in the peace process? You know, I have heard that. I have heard that, Well, George Bush is so pro-Israeli he does not -he cannot possibly care about the plight of the Palestinian person. I would hope that my record, one of liberation and-liberation, by the way, not only from dictatorship, but from the disease around the world, like ENTITY/ENTITY or malaria-is one that will say to people, he cares about the human condition, that he cares about each individual, that my religion teaches me to love your neighbor.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnadiabilbassychartersalarabiyatelevision0", "title": "George W.

But they are going to have to be-they are going to have to do some work. They are going to have to have security forces that protect the average person. They are going to have to have institutions that bring confidence for the Palestinians. They have to have the ability to attract investment. The Palestinians are great entrepreneurs, and if just given a chance, I am confident the business community will flourish. And most importantly, though, they are going to have to reject the extremists who murder innocent people. And by the way, we are engaged in a great ideological struggle. I mean, in retrospect, would you regret not being involved earlier in the peace process, 7 years ago? I think that you would find that I have been very much involved in the peace process when you look at the facts. And the reason we have been able to have this successful conference in Annapolis is because people's attitudes lined up in-kind of in the same direction. So this is the right time, you say? --for the couple of years of my administration. It took a while to convince people that the two-state solution was in the security interests of both parties. One was the intifada, which made it awfully hard to discuss peace at that time. It just-it created the conditions that made it more difficult to get people's minds in the right place to begin the process.

If they have had one-a program once, they can easily start a program. And so I view the Iranian regime as a danger. I also believe that the Iranian people are not bad-they are good people-and that they can have a better way forward. Well, what are you going to do about it? It is one thing to define the problem, do you have a strategy? And if you say you can solve it diplomatically, what is your strategy? And I will explain the strategy of economic isolation, that-you know, it is sad; we really do not need to have to be in this position. If the Iranian Government would suspend their enrichment programs, like the international community has demanded, there is a better way forward for them. But they say that they need this program. And my answer is, is that if you need it, then why have not you been transparent and disclosed it and honest about it? And what were you doing with a military-secret military program in the first place? And so I view Iran as a danger; I truly do. And I do not view the people as a danger, I view the Government as a danger. But will it be harder for you to try to convince the Gulf States what-the American position after the intelligence report? The fact that I am having to explain it means it is harder after the report. But I believe I will be able to convince them. What they want to know is whether or not I think they are a danger. They want to know whether I think it is a danger and are we committed to helping people achieve security. And part of the trip is to tell people, yes, we have got-we are engaged to help you, if you want our help to enhance security.

On the other hand, as you have heard me say many times since you cover the White House, that all options must be on the table in order to make sure diplomacy is effective. Secretary Gates told Al Arabiya in an interview recently that the diplomatic option is still 100 percent in focus. Does that mean that you are going to still pressure Iran on the diplomatic front? We will continue to pressure them on the diplomatic front. And it is hard, because sometimes people are more interested in market share for their goods than they are for achieving peace. And so I have spent a lot of time with allies in Europe, for example, convincing them of the importance of working together to send a common message to the Iranian regime. So yes, the diplomatic option is on the table, and it is active, and we are working hard. On the Syria issue-I do not know if I am allowed to ask one-- All you got to do is ask; I will handle it. On the Syria issue, I mean, we already talked about-you actually told me that you-patience with Asad is running out. But we still have no Lebanese election. What does it mean? What can you do? Is it sanction against Syria? What can you do? Well, what we can do is make sure that the world understands our position and try to convince them that we ought to work together to say to the Syrians, let Sleiman go forward. That is the President that the people want there in Beirut, and he ought to go forward. And that is going to be on my agenda when I talk to friends and allies in the Middle East, that-and we can collectively send the message to President Asad. We have sanctioned Syria, and I am looking at different ways to keep sending a tough message because, so far, he has shown no willingness to be constructive on Lebanon or in dealing with a militant Hamas or in stopping suiciders from heading into Iraq- in other words, some reasonable things that we would like to see done in order to improve relations which he has not done.

But some will say they might wait for another year until you leave office, and then-- Well, he could try that. But in the meantime, there will be others around who he will have irritated as a result of his stubbornness. And so yes, I mean, he could try to wait me out, but there is other leaders in the world that are as equally concerned as I am about Syria not letting the Presidency go forward and really hurting this very important democracy in the Middle East. Lebanon's survival as a democracy is, in my judgment, very important for the world. And Syria is-has been-when we passed the resolution out of the United Nations, it worked. And yet as opposed to honoring the notion of staying out of the-and to stop obstructing politics- Syria has just not been helpful at all. So will you impose sanction on Syria? We have already, and we are looking at different options, of course. Well, we are always looking for ways to make sure that we are effective. To show that you actually supporting Prime Minister Siniora, why not visiting Lebanon on this trip? You have to just-I have got only so much time. We have had plenty of high-ranking officials go to support Prime Minister Siniora. I think about Condi, and I think about Admiral Fallon, who I sent over there to help analyze what the Lebanese forces need. Listen, I was very impressed when Prime Minister Siniora made the decision to move Lebanese forces into the extremist stronghold and dealt with them. That is what you are supposed to do. And in order to have a safe and secure society, the state has got to show that it can provide security for the people and not tolerate pockets of extreme radicals who are murderous in their intentions, and he did. And right after that, I sent Admiral Fallon in to say, look, we need to help strengthen this man. He showed courage and leadership, and he needs to have a military that is able to function at the behest of a state to provide security.

You can hang out with a limited number of friends, like Iran, or you can have better relations in the neighborhood and in the world. Step one is to get out of the way of these Presidential elections. They have got a good candidate. A lot of people agree that this is the person, and now Syria needs to get out of the way. Sir, on the Iraq issue, the security has improved. Does that mean you are going to withdraw troops by the end of the year? Our troops decisions will be made based upon the considered recommendations of our commanders. And success in Iraq is essential, and therefore, I will make the decisions along with those recommendations based upon success. There is still a lot of work to be done, however, and I am-you know what thrills me the most is that the average Iraqi's life is becoming more hopeful. Here is what I tell people. the chance for that child to grow up in peace and to realize dreams; a chance for the child to go outside and play and not fear harm. There is still too many suiciders, but the level of violence is declining. I did not see this, but I was told that the celebrations at New Year's Eve in Baghdad were festive. And life is coming back, and it is -that is exciting to me. And just to follow up on that, the generals were saying that Iran and Syria actually has been playing a role in stopping the suiciders of coming to Iraq. Would you credit them for that at least? I am not willing to credit the Iranians yet. I do not have enough evidence. One general said that, then he corrected his story. I think so long as we are finding sophisticated IEDs-that could only have been manufactured in Iran, that are killing innocent people inside Iraq-that is cause for concern. I am willing to have dialogues with the Iranians about Iraq in Iraq, but our message will be, if we catch you providing arms and trained-training people, then we will -we are going to hold them to account.

I take it you are not calling it illegal. What I am saying is that companies thrive in the United States in part because they benefit from the best university system in the world, the best infrastructure -- although I'd like to see us do a little better on infrastructure. You know, there are a whole range of benefits that have helped to build companies, create value, create profits. For you to continue to benefit from that entire architecture that helps you thrive, but move your technical address simply to avoid paying taxes, is neither fair nor is it something that is going to be good for the country over the long term. And this is basically taking advantage of tax provisions that are technically legal , but I think most people would say if you are doing business here, if you are basically still an American company, but you are simply changing your mailing address in order to avoid paying taxes, then you are really not doing right by the country and by the American people. Some people would respond that, you know what, these guys are hired to maximize profit. And they are doing basically what they were hired to do. And in fact, it is plenty American for them to try to make as much profit as they can, hire as many people as they can as a result. Well, keep in mind that what we are trying to do is to say that if you simply acquire a small company in Ireland or some other country to take advantage of the low tax rate, you start saying we are now magically an Irish company, despite the fact that you may only have a hundred employees there And you have got 10,000 employees in the United States. You are just gaming the system. You continue to benefit in all kinds a ways from being an American company. It is true that, you know, there are a lot of things that may be legal that probably are not the right thing to do by the country. People are paid to maximize profits. They are also paid to make sure that they are thinking about, in addition to shareholder value, how do you grow a company over the long term?

Your critics suggest that you have not put the presidential muscle behind this issue, certainly the way you did health care or the way you did stimulus early on in your presidency. Well, we reached out repeatedly to both Democrats and Republicans. If we lower corporate tax rates and close loopholes, there is going to be more certainty in terms of what corporations pay. They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance. It would allow us potentially to have companies who have profits overseas to start bringing some of those profits back and reinvesting in the United States. So there is a whole bunch of good reasons why we should do it. I will be honest with you ENTITY. And they have trouble getting stuff done right now even when they say they want to do something. And I have said to the speaker, I have said to Majority Leader Reid, that we are prepared and we have put forward very specific proposals in terms of how we can get this done. Invariably, it takes some time to work through a big tax reform piece of legislation. When Ronald Reagan last did it back in '86, '87, it was about a year-and-a-half-long process. And I think that the people should expect that this administration will be foursquare behind it as long as the goal of tax reform is to simplify the system, make it fair, as opposed to simply slashing corporate rates while maintaining a bunch of loopholes that are not productive and are not creating jobs and value here in America. Well, let us move from talking about the guys in the C suites to average Americans here. What will you tell average American viewer about the outlook for the economy? Your former economic advisor, Larry Summers says we may be in for a period here in America of lower growth for a protracted period of time. Do you believe in that forecast? And are you concerned that that means we are not going to be able to meet the entitlement promises that we have made without cutting those entitlements and/or raising taxes?

We are now producing more oil than we import, first time in a couple of decades, even as we are massively increasing clean energy. And when it comes to deficits, we have cut them by more than half. And when it comes to health care, we are slowing the growth of health care inflation to the lowest levels in 50 years. So there are a lot of things there that I will - that give me confidence we are poised to take off. But there are some things that are holding us back. The main thing that is holding us back is inaction by our federal government on things like infrastructure, on raising the minimum wage, on doing some things that would help middle-class families feel a little bit of relief. If we do those things, then we are going to be in pretty good shape. It is true, coming out of a financial crisis - historically, when you look at worldwide trends, it is hard when you have a big financial crisis that precipitates a recession. The good news is, because of the resilience of the American people, but also in part because of some good policies and quick action on our part, we have recovered faster and stronger than most counterparts around the world. I can confirm most of your data as the economics reporter for CNBC. And I think you have heard me on the stump talk about this is the source of anxiety for the American people. Now these are 20-, 30-year trends that we have been seeing, a larger and larger portion of increased productivity and increased profits accruing to the very top of the economic pyramid, and the vast majority of middle class folks and folks who are trying to work in the middle class, not seeing higher incomes, higher wages. There are policies we can put in place that can help that. Some of it has to do with globalization. Some of it has to do with technology. Some of it has to do with what some have called a shift to a more winner-take-all economy, because capital's mobile and workers are not and they have less leverage.

It is now at near-record levels almost every day. Are you concerned there is a bubble out there like we had in '01 and '08? Well, you know, I try to avoid commenting on the day-to-day trends in the stock market. I think what is true is that the Federal Reserve has properly focused on the need for us to bring unemployment down. The cost of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, as well as unemployment for young people just getting started in their careers, that is something that has devastating effects on the economy for generations, or for decades to come. So I think Janet Yellen has said this is a focus of ours right now. What that does mean is when you have got low interest rates that there is a lot of money looking for returns. And that is probably boosted the stock market significantly. My estimation is that, you know, you have got a lot of savvy investors out there. You have got people who recognize that what goes up can come down as well. I will leave it up to them to make determinations about whether valuations and stock prices are too high. I am more concerned about the day-to-day fundamentals. And if we get those fundamentals right, then I am pretty confident that we can do very well in the next decade. You have said a bunch of times that getting the wealthy to pay a little bit more. And you have succeeded in raising that top tax rate to 39 percent, or rolling back the tax cuts. Is there a limit to how much you believe the government should take from an individual in terms of a top tax rate? You know, I do not have a particular number in mind, but if you look at our history, we are still well below what, you know, the marginal tax rates were under Dwight Eisenhower or, you know, all the way up even through Ronald Reagan.

And if we close some of those loopholes, not just carried interest but a range that we know are not economically productive, then sure, some folks do not get to take advantage of stuff they should've been taking advantage of anyway. But that also means we can finance government, keep our deficits under control, and invest in the things that we need to grow over the long term. There is no doubt that the economies of Russia and Europe have intertwined, primarily around the energy sector. And it makes some Europeans more concerned about a robust response to the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity that Russia's been conducting when it comes to Ukraine. The good news is that, despite some of those commercial concerns, we have seen Europe move with us - not always as fast as we'd like, but they get there. And sadly, tragically, the shooting down of this Malaysian Airlines airliner and the recognition that it is likely it was shot down and it is also likely that it was conducted by non-state actors that were provided incredibly powerful weapons by the Russian government - all that, I think, may stiffen the spine of my European partners moving forward. I want to ask you about Israel. What do you make of these - the FAA banning these flights and then lifting it? Do you think it is safe for Americans to fly to Israel? You know, we have not made decisions when it comes to airline safety based on not just politics, but even our strong alliance with Israel. We have to just look at the facts. The initial ban that was imposed by the FAA was based on Israel needing to show us that, in fact, it was safe for commercial airlines to fly in.

My name is ENTITY, and I am ENTITY of news and politics at YouTube. We had a chance to do this before I was elected and had a great time, so I am glad we can do it again. Well, let us tell people a little bit about how this works. Five days ago, as you were delivering your State of the Union address, we opened up our Moderator platform on YouTube, where thousands of people have been submitting and voting on both video and text questions. Some of them, as you will see, were hard-hitting. But all of the questions you will see here today were voted into the top tier of the thousands of questions we received.

He submitted this video to remind us of where things were a year ago. Marcus writes, ENTITY, I know there have been political setbacks to getting health-care reform done, but the 40 million people who have no insurance cannot wait. Will they be able to get insurance this year? We now have a bill that is come out from the House, come out from the Senate. And if you look at the core components of that legislation, what you have is 30 million people who get coverage, insurance reform so that people who have health insurance are going to be able to be protected from not being able to get it because of preexisting conditions, or suddenly losing their health care because, you know, the insurance company has some fine print that they did not read. It makes sure that we actually start bending the cost curve, controlling the rising premiums by instituting better practices in terms of how we reimburse doctors and how we ask hospitals to work together. We have already invested in electronic IT, electronic medical records, things that can help make the system more efficient. So we have this enormous opportunity. But the way the rules work in the United States Senate, you have got to have 60 votes for everything.

And the number-one question we got in health care came from Mr. Anderson in Texas, who asked, why are the health-care meetings and procedures not on C- SPAN, as promised? And then one of the top questions in the government reform category was Warren Hunter in Brooklyn, who said, how do you expect people in this country to trust you when you have repeatedly broken promises that were made on the campaign trail, most recently the promise to have a transparent health-care debate? Well, I -- I guess -- first of all, I would say that we have been certified by independent groups as the most transparent White House in history. We are the first White House since the founding of the republic to list every visitor that comes into the White House online so that you can look it up. People know more about the inner workings of this White House, the meetings we have. We have excluded lobbyists from boards and commissions. But we also report on any lobbyist who meets with anybody who is part of our -- part of our administration. So we have actually followed through on a lot of the commitments that we have made. And so Warren's mistaken in terms of how he characterized it. What is fair to say is that as the health-care process went forward, not every single aspect of it was on C-SPAN. Now, keep in mind, most of the action was in Congress. So every committee hearing that was taking place, both in the House and the Senate, those were all widely televised. The only ones that were not were meetings that I had with some of the legislative leadership, trying to get a sense from them in terms of what it was that they were trying to do. I have acknowledged that. And that is why as we move forward, making sure that in this last leg, these last five yards before we get to the goal line, that everybody understands exactly what is going on in the health care bill -- that there are no surprises, no secrets -- that is going to be an imperative.

{"id": 2945, "text": "You know, the central focus of your State of the Union was obviously jobs. And a lot of people wrote in asking for some clarity around some of your plans for small businesses. I want to play you two video questions in a row. One year ago today, my wife and I were both let go from our jobs in corporate American within 48 hours of each other. We have since started a small business. And we employ a couple of people around us. What is being done to free up funding and encourage the growth of all the small businesses that have such a tremendous impact on our economy? how exactly are you planning on helping small businesses grow and prosper, besides simply providing tax breaks? Well, let me start with some specific issues that confront every small business all across the country. And it is absolutely true that if we can get small businesses back on their feet, then that is going to go a long way towards bringing the unemployment rate down, because that is the fastest generator of jobs across the country. Number one, small businesses really are still struggling with financing. You hear stories everywhere you go that even profitable, successful businesses are having trouble getting financing, because banks frankly just do not want to take the risk. After having taken way too many risk before, now they are taking no risk. And small businesses are punished for that. So we have expanded the SBA loan, the Small Business Administration loan, portfolio by about 70 percent. We have been waiving guarantees and fees, trying to streamline the process, just to get more capital into the hands of small businesses. It is important to see if we can give more incentives to small business. So, for example, we are just eliminating capital gains for small businesses, which is particularly important if you have got a start-up. Ten years from now, you may end up being successful with your small business, but suddenly you have got to pay taxes on it. If you can take that money and, instead of paying Uncle Sam, reinvest it in your business, you can grow it further. So we think that that is the kind of strategy that makes a lot of sense. We want to also make sure that we are providing tax credits for hiring of small businesses -- small businesses that are hiring new employees. And so we have got a whole range of proposals there. Now, in addition to the tax credits, in addition to the financing, one of the other things that, frankly, small businesses need is just a economic environment that is growing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

That 12-percent swing offers greater opportunities for small businesses to prosper and thrive. One of the biggest burdens on small businesses is health-care costs. And probably nobody benefits more from our health-care proposals than small businesses, because what we are doing is we are saying that not only will you get tax credits to buy health insurance, but we are also going to let you pool, buy in to a big exchange so that you have the same purchasing power as a big company like -- Ford or, you know, Google is able to negotiate with insurance companies and get a good deal. Well, now small businesses, by pooling together in this exchange, are going to have that same leverage. That will help lower their costs. And for a lot of small businesses, it is not just a matter of giving health insurance to your employees; it is also just being able to buy health insurance for yourself. That will cut down on small businesses' costs and they will be able to, again, invest more in their business. You know, a lot of Americans saw what happened on Wall Street this past year, and they wrote in saying, you know, When are we going to get OUR bailout?

I have a question about your -- program and why the banks are reluctant to modify loans of homeowners who can afford to stay in their homes. Now that taxpayers bailed them out, they refuse to help us out. And I would like to know what say you, ENTITY. Well, look, this is something that we have been dealing with since the beginning of this financial crisis. We set up a program for loan modification that so far about 4 million people have taken advantage of across the country. You have got about 800,000 people who have gotten loan modifications that are saving them an average of $550.

We are now pushing the banks as hard as we can to make sure that not only do they do the most with the resources that we have been giving them, but that they also do a much better job of customer service with people who are coming to them. I get letters all the time of people who've gone through all kinds of hoops, filled out forms; the bank does not call them back, or after they have gone through a trial period, the bank says, Well, you know, we now think we should not give you a home modification. What we are trying to do is to increase transparency and force all the banks to tell us exactly what are you doing with your customers who want to stay in their homes, can afford to pay a mortgage but need something a little bit more limited. And I am -- I am hopeful that we are going to continue to see more and more people take advantage of it.

You say whether you think it is good or bad, and maybe just a few sentences about why you think that. First one comes from Aloha Tony in your home state of Hawaii. He says, ENTITY, our deficit is higher than ever, at $12 trillion. Will you consider allowing the private sector to buy and take over the most troubled government-run agencies, such as the U.S. Postal Service?

Those companies would not want to provide universal service. My car-insurance company will allow me to take driver's ed classes to reduce my monthly premiums. Can we do the same thing for health insurance -- take classes in cooking, nutrition, stress management, communication, parenting, stopping smoking, maybe even exercise classes, and get a reduction on our monthly premiums? Well, I -- I think that the idea is a good one, and that is that if people are being healthy, that they should be able to get some incentives for that. And a lot of companies are starting to do that. We probably do not want the insurance companies, though, making those decisions, because insurance companies have every incentive to take the youngest, healthiest people and insure them, since they are less likely to have to pay out, and then leave older, sicker individuals out of their insurance pools. So it is important in any health-care program to make sure that the young and the healthy and the older and -- and the sicker are in a single pool. But what we should encourage are individual companies who provide incentives for wellness programs, smoking-cessation programs -- you know, that they are going to get a workout once in a while.

Well, let us move back to the questions. And I have got to tell you, the number-one question that came in, in the jobs and economy category, had to do with the Internet. And it came from James -- Indianapolis. He said, an open Internet is a powerful engine for economic growth and new jobs. Letting large companies block and filter online content and services would stifle needed growth. What is your commitment to keeping Internet open and neutral in America? Well, I am a big believer in net neutrality. I campaigned on this. I continue to be a strong supporter of it. My FCC chairman, Julius Genachowski, has indicated that he shares the view that we have got to keep the Internet open, that we do not want to create a bunch of gateways that prevent somebody who does not have a lot of money but has a good idea from being able to start their next YouTube or their next Google on the Internet. We are getting pushback, obviously, from some of the bigger carriers who would like to be able to charge more fees and extract more money from wealthier customers, but we think that runs counter to the whole spirit of openness that has made the Internet such a powerful engine for not only economic growth, but also for the generation of ideas and creativity. Well, you know, to get good jobs, I think many Americans realize they need a higher education. Here is a video question from Saginaw, Michigan. Dear ENTITY, as ENTITY who has 14 credits and three part-time jobs, just was wondering, what are your plans for -- plans to lower college tuition costs? You know, I know we are in a struggling economy right now, but any little bit that you can help would be appreciated. Well, ENTITY is right that, you know, college tuition costs are just crushing on a lot of folks. And this is something I remember from my own experience, because Michelle and I, we had college loans we kept on paying off for a decade after we had graduated from law school. We have already done a huge amount to increase Pell grants, to help increase the accessibility of college loans and grants at the college level, but we want to do more.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2950, "text": "And so we have put forward an initiative that is being debated in Congress and we hope to get passed this year, where if you have student loans, that you will not have to pay more than 10 percent of your income on those loans; that after 20 years, they will be forgiven; and if you have gone into public service, they will be forgiven after 10 years. That would provide a huge amount of relief for people. We still need to expand more the Pell grant program, make it both accessible to more people and raise the amount of tuition. In order to pay for this -- the best part of this is we can actually figure out how to pay for it, because right now you have got a lot of banks and financial-service companies who are still middlemen in the federally guaranteed loan programs. And if we can cut those middlemen out, then you have got several billion dollars that you can invest in the programs that I just described. This is something that I have made a top priority. I want us to once again have the highest college-graduation rates of any country in the world by 2020. Colleges and universities also, though, have to figure out how can they cut their costs. Because even if we are putting more and more loans in -- more and more money for loans, if the inflation in higher education keeps on skyrocketing, over time it is still going to gobble up all that extra money, and we will be right back where we started. So we have got to show more restraint at the college and university level in terms of ever- escalating costs. Well, let us back up a bit just from the specifics of education policy, and ask a more fundamental question, which comes from ENTITY in Ohio. As a math teacher, I want to know what you think it means to be an educated person. We know that if you have got a college education, you are going to make multiples of what you would make as a high school graduate, much less a high school dropout, over the course of lifetime. But its absolutely true that a high-quality education is not just a matter of being a good worker, it is also a matter of being a good citizen, it is also a matter of being able to think critically, evaluate the world around you, make sure that you can process all the information that is coming at us in a way that helps you make decisions about your own life, but also helps you participate in the life of the country.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I think that that requires more than just rote learning, although, you know, it certainly requires good habits and discipline in school. It also requires that in the classroom, they are getting the kind of creative teaching that is so important. And that is why our administration's initiated something called Race to the Top, where my secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, has helped to design a competition among states so that they can foster the kinds of excellence in learning everywhere, not just in some schools, not just in some states, but in every school in every state. If states want money, we are going to reward excellence. And if -- and we will show them, you know, what has been proven to work in terms of encouraging the kind of critical thinking that all of our children need. ENTITY, the number-two category after jobs and the economy that people submitted to you was national security and foreign policy. And the number-one question came from a concerned conservative in Georgia, who asked about your plans for the war on terror. And then Sean from Pennsylvania followed it up with, Dear ENTITY, if we remove our troops from the war on terror, how will you continue to combat the threat of terrorism? al Qaeda and its extremist allies that have metastasized around the globe; that would attack us, attack our allies, attack bases and embassies around the world and most -- most sadly attack innocent people regardless of their backgrounds, regardless of their religions. You know, al Qaeda is probably the biggest killer of innocent Muslims of any entity out there. Now, they employ terrorist tactics. And we have to fight them on all fronts. We have to fight them in very concrete ways in Afghanistan and along the border regions of Pakistan, where they are still holed up. They have spread to places like Yemen and Somalia.

And I think we have not done as good of a job on that front. We have to project economically, working in countries like a Yemen that is extraordinarily poor, to make sure that young people there have opportunity. The same is true in a place like Pakistan. So we want to use all of our national power to deal with the problem of these extremist organizations. But part of that does involve applications of military power. And that is why although it is the hardest decision that a commander in chief can make, to send our troops into battle, I thought it was very important to make sure that we had an additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan, to help train Afghan forces, so that they can start providing more effective security for their own country, in dealing with the Taliban, and ultimately allow us to remove our troops but still have a secure partner there that is not going to be able to use that region as a platform to attack the United States. Well, another central issue in the war on terror now is Guantanamo. And a lot of users wrote in about this. I think that question's actually about Sudan, which you did not actually address in your State of the Union, but it was actually the number-one-voted question, and it is a video from the Enough Project here in D.C. ENTITY, more than 3 million Darfuris fear returning home because of instability. Many fear that Sudan may be on the brink of war. What will you do to galvanize the international community to ensure that widespread violence does not occur in Sudan this year? Well, the situation -- Sudan has been heartbreaking, but also extremely difficult, and something that we started working on the day that I came into office. Our first task was, at that time, making sure that people who were in refugee camps in Darfur had access to basic water, food, other necessities of life. And this was after the Sudanese government in Khartoum had kicked out a whole bunch of nongovernmental organizations that were providing assistance there. We were able to get that assistance back in to help at least initially stabilize the situation. The next step in the challenge is to broker a lasting peace agreement between rebels who are still in the Darfur region and this -- this government.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2953, "text": "And I have got a special envoy who has been very active in trying to bring together the international community to get that deal brokered. Part of what makes it complicated is, you also have a conflict historically between northern Sudan and southern Sudan. They finally reached a agreement after a lot of work, but the Sudanese now -- the southern Sudanese now have an option where they may be seeking to secede from all of Sudan. That is another potential conflict that could create additional millions of refugees. And so what we are doing is trying to work with not only the regional powers, but the United Nations and other countries that have shown a great interest in this to see if we can broker a series of agreements that would stabilize the country, and then allow the refugees who are in Darfur to start moving back to their historic lands. Sadly, because of the genocide that took place earlier, a lot of those villages are now destroyed. And so thinking about how to resettle these populations in places that are viable economically, that have the resources to support populations, is a long-term development challenge that the international community is going to have to support. We continue to put pressure on the Sudanese government. If they are not cooperative in these efforts, then it is going to be appropriate for us to conclude that engagement does not work. And you know, we are going to have to apply additional pressure on Sudan in order to -- in order to achieve our objectives. But my hope is, is that we can broker agreements with all the parties involved to deal with what has been an enormous human tragedy in that region. Another question we missed from the deck, but it was about Guantanamo. And essentially, a user's saying, why is it taking so long to close down Guantanamo? Number one, you have got a whole bunch of individuals in Guantanamo, some of whom are very dangerous, some of whom were low- level fighters, some of whom the courts have determined should never have been put there in the first place. We have had to evaluate each of those cases -- hundreds of cases -- one by one to determine what these various categories are, and do it in a way that stands up to our standards of due process and legal scrutiny.

But unfortunately, there has been a lot of political resistance, and you know, frankly, some of it just politically motivated; some of it people being legitimately scared about, Well, if we have got somebody who we have been told is a terrorist in our backyard, will that make us a target? One of the things that we have had to try to communicate to the country at large is that historically we have tried a lot of terrorists in our courts. We have them in our federal prisons. But it is been one of those things that is been subject to a lot of, in some cases, you know, pretty rank politics. And you know, we have got to work through that process because Congress ultimately controls the purse strings in creating new facilities. If Congress makes a decision that they are going to try to block the opening of a new facility, it potentially constrains what our administration can do. And so this is something that we have got to work through both in Congress but also with public opinion, so that people understand that ultimately this is the right thing to do; by closing Guantanamo, we can regain the moral high ground in the battle against these terrorist organizations. There is been no bigger propaganda weapon for many of these extremists than pointing to Guantanamo and saying that we do not live up to our own ideals. And that is something that I strongly believe we have to resist, even if it has some costs to it and even if it is not always the most politically popular thing to do. ENTITY, we do not have much time left, but I want to make sure we get to the issue of energy, the environment. One of the rare moments where you were able to get applause from your friends on the Republican side of the aisle in Congress the other night was when you mentioned nuclear energy. And just today your budget announced tripling the loan guarantees for nuclear reactors. A lot of people had questions about just how this will work and why you did that. ENTITY, record numbers of young people elected you, in support of a clean-energy future. If money is tight, why do you propose wasting billions in expensive nuclear, dirty coal and offshore drilling?

{"id": 2955, "text": "Well, you are not going to get any argument from me about the need to create clean-energy jobs. I think this is going to be the driver of our economy over the long term. And that is why we put in record amounts of money for solar and wind and biodiesel and all the other alternative, clean-energy sources that are out there. In the meantime, though, unfortunately, no matter how fast we ramp up those energy sources, we are still going to have enormous energy needs that will be unmet by alternative energy. And the question then is, where -- where will that come from? Nuclear energy has the advantage of not emitting greenhouse gases. For those who are concerned about climate change, we have to recognize that countries like Japan and France and others have been much more aggressive in their nuclear industry, and much more successful in having that a larger part of their portfolio, without incident, without accidents. We are mindful of the concerns about storage of spent fuel and concerns about security. But we still think it is the right thing to do, if we are serious about dealing with climate change. With respect to clean-coal technology, it is not possible at this point to completely eliminate coal from the menu of our energy options. And if we are ever going to deal with climate change in a serious way, where we know China and India are going to be greatly reliant on coal, we have got to start developing clean-coal technologies that can sequester the harmful emissions; because otherwise, countries like China and India are not going to stop using coal, we will still have those same problems, but we will not have the technology to make sure that it does not harm the environment over the long term. So I know that there is some skepticism about whether there is such a thing as clean-coal technology. What is true is right now, that we do not have all the technology to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from a coal -- coal-powered -- power plants. But the technology is close, and it makes sense for us to make that investment now, not only because it'll be good for America, but it will also ultimately be good internationally. We can license and export that technology in ways that help other countries use a better form of energy that is going to be helpful to the climate-change issue.

How does this bill specifically target them? Well, first of all, I think it is important to remember that we are going through the worst financial crisis and subsequent economy that we have seen since the Great Depression and so the challenges for everybody out there is tough. You are right; it is especially tough for the African-American community. The steps we took in the first two and a half years made a difference. It made sure that a lot of folks were still on the job that otherwise would not be. It made sure that states were able to stabilize their budgets, so they were not laying off as many teachers or fire fighters or civil servants that are providing services every day. But, you know, what we realized over the last couple of months is that because of a whole range of issues, including what is happened overseas in Europe, that the economy needs another boost, and we have got to focus more on putting people back to work now. So the Jobs' Bill, overall, is designed to make sure that we are rebuilding schools and bridges and putting construction workers back to work. It makes sure that we are putting teachers back in the classroom. It makes certain that we are providing incentives to hire veterans who have been out of work, but also the long-term unemployed who are out of work. And it makes sure that we are providing tax breaks and tax credits to just about every family and every middle class person and every small business around the country. Now, with respect to the African-American community, they benefit from all of that, but in addition, we are making sure that summer jobs for youth are included in the package. Making sure that we reform our unemployment insurance so that, in addition to 1.4 million African-Americans getting unemployment insurance, we are also providing them a pathway so that they start getting some on-the-jobs training. All those things are going to have a huge impact in the African-American community. Why not say then, This is for you. This is for African-Americans?

There are a whole bunch of folks all across the country who need help. And we are going to help every single person who needs help. Were their expectations way back when in 2009 too high?

But the other thing I want to make sure that you do not just kind of slip in there with this notion that African-American leaders of late have been critical. There have been a handful of African-American leaders who have been critical. They were critical when I was running for ENTITY. There is always going to be somebody who is critical of the ENTITY.

And right now, the economy has been bad for a long time. It was bad before I got elected, and it has continued to be very tough for a lot of folks.

I do not want that to happen. I want to be on the same wavelength as much as we can. So, I would say the meeting is designed to see that the two ships do not pass in the night for lack of light. But what specifically will you bring up first? Well, as I say, we have not ever set an agenda. Clearly, I will be interested in getting his views on the dynamic changes taking place in Eastern Europe. We will have detailed conversations about his economy, and I will be glad to talk to him about ours. And so, I think along those two areas you will see a lot of discussion. problems in this hemisphere, support for Nicaragua, for example; Afghanistan; other areas where Soviet interest and the United States do not parallel each other. You sent him a message in reply to his earlier cable, again saying that you support the reforms going on in his country and in Eastern Europe. Do you support them to the extent that you'd put your money where your mouth is, so to speak, and grant the Soviets some sort of economic assistance to spur those reforms? Well, I am perfectly prepared to discuss economic reforms and what the Soviets would like to see in terms of interest from the West. But I noted with great interest Mr. Shevardnadze's view when asked a similar question. We are not looking for aid. We are not wanting somebody to bail us out. They are a sovereign state, have a high degree of pride but clearly, there will be a discussion of economic matters as they affect the Soviet Union. When you say, as you did in a speech this week, that the Malta summit the Malta meeting, as you all here prefer to call it will not be used to negotiate the future of Europe, what does that mean? Are you taking something off the table there? What I am saying is we are not going to have a Yalta. To the extent that it is not the role of the United States of America and the Soviet Union to divide up things or alter borders or do some of the things that took place at the meeting I have just referred to. We are not going to get into that.

So, I will not confirm or deny anything of that nature. Now, if you'd like me to state would we like to see Noriega out of office absolutely. I know you want him out of office.

No, not on this matter specifically, and if there were to be a plan and I think we have a pretty good understanding with the Intelligence Committee at this point, in the Senate and in the House. Is reunification of the two Germanys is that inevitable? I gave my view on that, and I said that that was a matter for the people of the Germanys to determine. And it is a highly sensitive matter as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, and it is better to leave it right there. But when you look at the way events are going there, is it inevitable in your opinion? And I would say it is a matter for the determination of the German people. Well, many people look at the history books, and they worry about that prospect. Well, we have had discussions with countries that express concerns in this regard because of certain historical precedents, but I do not think that history need repeat itself if there evolves a single German State. But that is down the road, and it is not something that is being pressed. That is a matter for the determination of the German people.

The Soviet Union has there is no great debate on the principles of the reductions that we have proposed.

That is not going to take place at Malta because the details have not been worked out in the multilateral forum where they are being discussed in Vienna.

I have made very clear that I they can test me all they want; they can package it any way they want, but if it expands the use of federally appropriated funds for abortion, I am not going to sign it.

I have tried to be a good President for the farmers of this country. And our Agriculture Department, our Agriculture Secretary has done a very good job not only in the flood but afterward. I am sure you know that there was an announcement today that the Agriculture Department will give export enhancements to seven states of the former Soviet Union to try to increase the export of livestock, particularly the pork exports to those countries. And we supported ethanol production; we still do. And we are doing a number of other things that I believe will really help the farm economy in Iowa.

President Clinton, unemployment is the lowest now it is been nationwide in years, you know this, and the economy is strong. And yet your approval rating is under 50 percent here in Iowa. Now, with that in mind, how do you think that your visit tomorrow will influence Iowa's undecided voters? Well, what we have to do is get the record out there. the family and medical leave law; the Brady bill; the crime bill; immunizations for all the kids in the country under 2; middle class college loans; apprenticeships for people who are not going to college; an expansion of Head Start. But the people do not know it because this has been a contentious 2 years. The Republicans have been more partisan than any party has against a President of the opposing party since World War II.

You saw some reports I did in the morning paper about testimony about the condition under which some of these guests I mean, hostages are being held. That worries me.

But whether there is been a direct contact from Mr. Howell in our Embassy in Kuwait, I do not know about it, and I'd be inclined to doubt that because of the inhumane way in which our Embassy is isolated. If the Iraqis refuse to allow the Embassy to be resupplied, would the U.S. then ask that all the Americans, including the civilians, be permitted to evacuate the Embassy? I'd request that right now. Anybody should have free access to come or go where they want to.  They ought not to have to go be marched off as prisoners. And so, clearly, I'd call on them, and so is the United Nations. This is in keeping with the United Nations condemnation. Are you going to keep them there now that the U.N. has at least given you the right to resupply them? I think we have to look at that. And the main thing is, at this juncture, there are priorities to be sure people have enough to eat and that they are not put under continued duress there. Well, have you made your point? Is it necessary to have them there anymore? There are other Americans there, and always your Embassy has kind of a consular service to try to service the concerns of other citizens. But as others are brutalized and thus sent into hiding, why, that function becomes a little more blurred. So, I just do not know the answer to that. If they blocked resupply, would that be the sort of provocation you have spoken about earlier? Either it would be directly contravening a mandate from the United Nations, and we would view that very seriously, yes. I cannot go into hypothesis.

We understood, I think all of us understood, what we had to do as a country when communism rose at the end of the Second World War and took over Eastern Europe. And basically there was nothing we could do about it. I think everybody knew there was nothing we could do about that. But we were able to draw a line in the sand in Europe; we were able to limit the expansion in Korea. Maybe we made some mistakes in overreacting not perhaps just in Vietnam but in Central America because we were so worried about communism. But at least we did do that. We contained communism until it could collapse of its own failures and the truth reaching in to all these Communist countries. And even when we erred, we did so with-in good faith I think.

And whether they will or not in the future is up to Mr. Greenspan. It is an independent part of our Government. But nevertheless, I can safely say to our partners, we are taking steps necessary to make sure our economy recovers, and that includes, by the way, addressing energy. And needless to say, we had a very frank discussion about energy in my last trip to Europe, and I suspect we will have another frank discussion about energy. One of the things-the Prime Minister of Canada and I have had a very interesting relationship, and one that will continue to grow, is over energy. He knows full well- and Canada, by the way, is now the largest supplier of energy to the United States, and there are some great opportunities for us to enhance natural gas deliverability into our country by cooperating in our own hemisphere . My only point is that I will assure my friends and our trading partners that we are doing our part to strengthen our economy, but we have got to work to make sure we reduce trade barriers in order for prosperity to continue. The dollar is what it is based upon market. And the reason I say that is, our Government will not artificially enter markets. The market decides the strength of the dollar. And I would urge other countries, now, to do the same thing. A strong dollar has got, obviously, benefits and problems for us. One, it is harder to export, but it also helps attract capital. And much of our economy relies upon investors investing in the U.S. because of the dollar. And so we understand the pluses and minuses and, therefore, let the market determine the float of the dollar. I do not know if that answered your question properly. My question is-I tried to follow up his question. So, ENTITY, you met Prime Minister Koizumi last month, and it was a very good meeting.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-7", "publication_date": "17-07-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

So, President, are you concerned about such a weak yen? And may I-President, my second part of the question is on Kyoto Protocol issues. And President, you know the Japanese Government have been trying to persuade the United States to participate in Kyoto agreement, but the U.S. is still reluctant to join. So my question is, what will be the U.S. reaction if Japan move forward to sign the Kyoto agreement without U.S. commitment to join the agreement? Well, first I did have a great visit with your Prime Minister. He is tackling a very tough economic situation, a huge amount of debt. And he is willing to work hard to restructure and reform the economy so that there is, in fact, transparency and reality in the assessment of the Japanese economy. And I appreciate that a lot. I said in my statement with him at Camp David that we firmly stand with him on his reforms. And of course there may be a consequence as to the yen and dollar relationship, but the market ought to make that decision. I believe Japan-and we hope that Japan does restructure her economy and fully address the loans and the debt overhang in a very constructive, forthright manner. I believe the Prime Minister intends to do that, and I urge him and continue to encourage him to do so. And I appreciate his willingness to take on this very difficult issue, and I think the Japanese people appreciate that as well. Secondly, we also had a long discussion about Kyoto, as I have with many of the leaders around the world, and I made it clear to all the world leaders that our country supports the goals. We just have differences on the methodology. I reminded the people that we spend a lot of money on understanding global warming, that we approach the issue from a science-based perspective, that the goals are unrealistic, however, and that the United States Congress-Senate made it very clear that they were unrealistic with a 95-to-nothing vote and that my assessment of the situation was upfront.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-7", "publication_date": "17-07-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

You know, some leaders were more sympathetic than others, I must confess. Nevertheless, I do believe that people appreciated the frank assessment, and I believe they are going to appreciate the strategy that we lay out over time to help meet the needs. Each country has to make its own mind up as to how to proceed with this issue. Each country must-the parliaments of these countries must deliberate. The governments must be straightforward, it seems like to me, about the consequences. And we will see how other nations-I know how other nations have accepted my declaration; we will see how they handle it with their own internal politics regarding this issue. But we can continue to cooperate and will cooperate on technology transfers. You know, a new generation of nuclear power and the capacity to be able to handle the waste in a technologically feasible way makes a lot of sense. And our Nation is more than willing to invest in new technologies and to look at how to make the world more clean. I reminded the ministers and the leaders that this also relates to energy. And as one of the trading partners, significant trading partners for many countries, it seems like the nations would want our economy to continue to grow. And yet, in order to do so, we must address our energy needs. But make no mistake about it, when you import nearly 60 percent of your product from overseas, that is a dependency upon foreign sources that can create instability. Secondly, we have got to find-and the State of California was the best in conservation in the Nation. They are the best at putting conservation practices in place, but they ran out of energy. And so on the one hand, we have got to do a better job of conservation, and we will. The Vice President has spent a lot of time talking about that. But we have got to find more energy. They had not built a powerplant in 12 years in the State of California.

I talked very frankly to leaders around the table about the need for us to continue to come up with safe alternatives, safe disposal practices for nuclear energy. But our Nation needs to look into it, and so does the developing world, by the way, it seems like to me. And you know, some in Europe have a different perspective about nuclear energy. It is an important discussion, and we will continue to consult with our friends. First of all, I wanted to thank you for inviting us all in-it is a high-working in my life. President Putin yesterday suggested that he wants a new security structure in Europe that would either involve Russia in NATO or NATO disbanded and a new infrastructure with Russia in it. I wonder whether you think such integration can really be on the table. And also, the Russians and the Chinese have just concluded a new treaty on friendship. And both of those countries are firmly opposed to NMD, so I wonder if you are concerned about that issue. I can understand nations that share a large border wanting to work on a friendship agreement. It makes sense to me. First, let me say, we did have a very constructive meeting in Slovenia. It was a very forthright, very straightforward, very open discussion about issues. And I made it very clear to Mr. Putin that Russia is no longer our Nation's enemy. And therefore, I do not think-the therefore of that is that we should not view each other with suspicion, that we ought to think seriously about working together to get rid of a document that codified a cold war distrust. It was a document-when Russia and America divided the world into armed camps and we stared each other down with missiles. I have spoken very clearly to the President that it is time for new leadership to develop a new strategic framework for peace. The threats that the ABM Treaty addressed no longer exists-no longer exists. cyberterrorism, fundamentalist extremists, extremism that certainly threatens us, threatens Israel, who is our strong ally and friend, threatens Russia.

It is a defense, as opposed to relying on peace-but with offensive weapons, why do not we think about developing defensive systems. So I have read with interest the statements-I have been reading with interest the statements by a lot of people. But this Nation, I am committing this Nation to a more peaceful world by a realistic assessment of the threats. And we have got to address them, and I am going to. And I continue to consult with our allies and friends, which I am confident this topic will come up with Tony Blair. I look forward to explaining him my position. I did so with the Prime Minister; I have done so with the leaders of every nation represented here. I did so with Jean Chretien right here at this table during my first working dinner as the President of the United States. He sat right there, and we had this discussion. I explained to him the philosophy behind my attitudes. I firmly believe it is the right thing to keep the peace. And I look forward to a continued dialog starting next-whenever-Sunday, I guess it is, with Mr. Putin, on this very subject. I am not going to speak for him, but I will tell you, he listened very carefully, and I appreciated that. Can both sides belong to the same structure? Well, first of all, his vision, he mentioned this in our press conference in Slovenia, as well. He talked about a NATO that might at some point include Russia. I think that is what he was saying. In the meantime, however, there is a round of NATO expansion-the practicality is, there is a round of NATO expansion next fall, a year from this coming fall, and I will reiterate what I said. It is not a matter of when-I mean, it is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.

You have expressed a strong desire to get at the natural gas that is in the Northwest Territories. How do you reconcile that with the very intense political pressure to bring the gas south, through Alaska, bypassing the Canadian resources? And secondly, you have talked about a continental energy policy, energy pact. You have got free trades with NAFTA. Would a logical next step, given the United States' great need for water, be a water pact? Let me start with the energy. One, an Alaska pipeline; and secondly, a Canadian pipeline-or perhaps a combination of the two. We have got a debate here in America about whether or not America ought to be exploring for natural gas in parts of our State of Alaska. It is very similar to the Northwest Territories in Canada. The Canadian Government has made- along, I might add, with the tribes in that part of the world-have made the decision that exploration for natural gas would not only be economically beneficial but can be done in a way that does not harm the environment. I agree with their assessment. Whether or not the United States is willing to think along the same lines is an open question that is still going to be debated in the United States Senate. Nevertheless, my attitude is, we need supply. And therefore, I have committed myself to working with the Canadian Government to figure out how to get natural gas into the United States. And we are willing to work with your Government to figure out a way that can expeditiously move gas. He is referring-you know, obviously, to the extent that it would be an American pipeline, a pipeline on American soil would make it easier for me politically. Nevertheless, I am a practical man; I want the gas here. We will continue to work on the Alaska pipeline. I know there is enough reserve to justify a Canadian line. It is conceivable we could have both, that would both feed the midwestern market and the western market. The second issue is hemispheric energy, and that really pertains to-I do not know if you know this, but Mexico is a net importer of gas.

And we have got to encourage Mexico, and I know that President Fox thinks this way, about enhancing exploration for what he calls dry gas in the country of Mexico. As well, we are working on electricity hookups. And one of the things that the Prime Minister and I have talked about, the possibility of hydroelectric power generating in Canada, moving down through to particularly the Midwest. It requires a significant amount of capital outlay, but nevertheless, it is really worth the discussion. Water is-I am from a part of the world where-where I grew up, there was no water. And at one time, when the price of international crude oil got down to around $10 a barrel, water was more valuable than oil, at least where we live. Water will forever be an issue in the United States, particularly the Western United States. I do not know exactly what you have in mind in terms of importation of water. I presume it is -perhaps some have suggested abandoned pipelines that used to carry energy. I would be open to any discussions. Our Nation must develop a comprehensive water strategy as we head-particularly as these Western States continued to grow. You know, one big debate we have in America is whether or not we build more reservoir space, more water storage, aboveground water storage. It is a battle, needless to say, that pits local conservationists versus those with agricultural interests, for example. And I have looked forward to discussing this with the Prime Minister, should he want to bring it up, at any time, because water is valuable for a lot of our countries. A lot of people do not need it, but when you head south and west, we do need it.

Patrice, I think they realize that, one, my Nation is firmly committed to NATO, the expansion of NATO. Our commitment to NATO is real. One of the big issues- that is important for people's vision of the American role-very important. You know, during the course of the campaign, I made it clear that I thought that our military should be used to fight and win war-that is what I thought the military was for-and that I was concerned about peacekeeping missions and that we have got to be very clear about-to our friends and allies about how we use our troops for nation-building exercises, which I have rebuffed as a-basically rebuffed as a kind of a strategy for the military. And as a result of that, some in Europe were very concerned about our presence in the Balkans, for example. We came in together. That is an important statement for people to understand, that our Nation will continue to work with our European friends-in this case, to bring stability to the Balkans and Macedonia. We have got an Ambassador on the ground there working with the EU Ambassador to bring peace. Having said that, it is important, however, to continue to work, though, to replace troops in a responsible manner with civil institutions, civil structures that can do the same thing the troops are doing. We have got to work for a police force and security arrangements that are run locally, so that the NATO troops at some point in time will no longer serve as peacekeepers. Now, that is obviously more opportunistic to do that in Bosnia than it is in Kosovo at this point in time, but nevertheless, we must do so. In terms of the EU, I believe that we can have a very constructive relationship with the EU. Obviously, there are some concerns where we differ, but we should not allow these differences-like biotechnology, for example, which I talked about today in my speech regarding developing nations. The U.N. came out-this is kind of an aside-the U.N. came out with a very interesting study that made it clear that biotech and biotechnology will enhance the ability of poor nations to grow more plentiful amounts of food.

If they are trying to undo trade, it seems like to me, their strategy and their philosophy will lock people into poverty. And I strongly disagree with them, and I made that clear in a speech today. You need to get the exact wording in the transcript. There should be no question about my view, about what these voices of isolationism and protection are doing. They can couch it in any words they want, but they are condemning people to poverty, as far as I am concerned. They need to go and ask the people. Ask the African nations; ask what their hope is.

Thank you, Dr. Koop, and members of the public community who are here. To Members of Congress, the attorneys general, the representatives of plaintiffs in the private litigation and we have one of the injured parties here representing all of them we thank all of them for coming today. This is a time of prosperity and hope and optimism for America, with our economy improving, making progress on our social problems, our efforts to lead the world to a more prosperous and peaceful future making headway. But I think we all know that this country still has some significant challenges, especially in the health field. And if we think about what we want America to be like in the 21st century, the health of our people and especially the health of our children must be paramount in our thinking, in our vision, and in our efforts. That is why a year ago I worked with the FDA and we launched this nationwide effort to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco by reducing youth access to tobacco products, by preventing companies from advertising to our children. The purpose of the FDA rule was to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent within 7 years. Earlier this year, a Federal judge in North Carolina said that the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect the health of our children. There have also been other examples of litigation progress, as you know, brought by private plaintiffs and by the attorneys general. Now, these victories for public health drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table. They extracted concessions that would have been literally unthinkable just a short time ago. I want to say a special word of thanks to the attorneys general and the other parties who worked hard to negotiate this settlement. Everyone knows we would not be here had it not been for their foresight, their determination, and their relentless efforts. Now we have this unprecedented opportunity to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation, working with all the parties involved, the Members of Congress, the attorneys general, the representatives of injured parties, the public health community, the tobacco farmers, and others. We have moved from confrontation and denial and inertia to the brink of action on behalf of our children, and that is all to the good. the dramatic reduction of teen smoking.

{"id": 3039, "text": "There are five key elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. That is why I believe the first thing any tobacco legislation must include is a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. These penalties should be non-tax-deductible, uncapped, and escalating to give the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting children as new customers. One of the surest ways of reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Today I call for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next decade, as needed, to meet our youth reduction targets. And I call upon the House to follow the lead of the United States Senate and repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a $50 billion tax credit. Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. I believe the FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as strong and effective as its authority over drugs and devices. In particular, legislation cannot impose any special procedural hurdles on the FDA's regulation of tobacco products. Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable, especially in any efforts to market products to children, while insisting on changes in the way it does business. I ask the industry again to make a voluntary commitment to stop advertising to children. And I call upon Congress to pass legislation providing for broad document disclosure so that the public can learn everything the tobacco companies know about the health effects of their products and their attempts to market to our children. Fourth, Federal tobacco legislation must aim not only to reduce youth smoking but to meet other health goals as well. These include the reduction of secondhand smoke, the expansion of smoking prevention and cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other important health objectives. We must build on the bipartisan agreement to fund children's health care in the recent balanced budget. And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities. We know that tobacco farmers are honest, hardworking people, most of whom live and work on small, family owned farms. In some States, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must protect these farmers, their families, and their communities from loss of income.

And finally, let me say again, we would not be here if it were not for all the people in this room and the countless others they represent around the country. To me, this is not about money. It is not about how much money we can extract from the tobacco industry. It is about fulfilling our duties as parents and responsible adults to protect our children and to build the future of this country. We are doing everything we can in this administration to give parents the tools they need to raise their children, but parents have to be our partners as well. If this is not just about money, we have to recognize that even beyond the tobacco companies and all of us in this room, every parent in America has a responsibility to talk to their children about the dangers of tobacco, illegal drugs, and other things that can hurt them. We know if we have strong parental responsibility here, they can make a great deal of difference in protecting our children as well. If we take responsibility, if we pass this legislation, if we do what we should here, if the tobacco industry will work with us, if other Members of Congress in both parties will work with us, we will have gone a very long way toward creating the state of health for our children that will make America an even greater nation in the new century. ENTITY, what are the chances of the Congress adopting your policy? Well, first of all, I was encouraged by some of the comments that were made by some industry representatives. I think that they know that they have to have Federal legislation. They have an interest in that as well. And I would hope that they would be willing to work with us. But we cannot have the FDA crippled here, and we have to have real and meaningful penalties if the targets for youth smoking are not met. And so I feel very good about that. I think the Congress I think it is highly likely that they will take action. When they take action depends, I think, upon when they can work through the issues for themselves and how they decide how to divide up the work among the committees.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedtobaccolegislationandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Tobacco Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-tobacco-legislation-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "17-09-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

ENTITY, you have not said what you are willing to agree to for the tobacco industry. Are you willing to agree to immunity from future liability? Well, I do not think they have asked for future liability, I think they have asked for immunity from liability for past suits. And the question there would be, what are they willing to agree to? They need to come and meet with us. We need to discuss it, and we need to see whether we can embody these five principles. To me, I will say again, this is not primarily about money. This is about changing the behavior of the United States, both the behavior of the tobacco companies, the behavior of the American people, the future behavior of our children. I am trying to create an environment here with these five principles that I believe would achieve that. And if they want to be our partners in it, I think we can get there. Are you willing to put your prestige on the line to ensure that this becomes law? Well, I think my personal prestige on this has been on the line for more than a year now. There for a while, I thought more than my prestige was on the line. You know, for a person involved in public life in Washington today, personal prestige may be an oxymoron. But at least you still have your neck most days. What do you say to the people ENTITY, how do you protect the well-being of tobacco farmers sounds like you are going to take away their livelihood. Well, there are a number of things which can be done, and I do not want to get into the details. Secretary Glickman can talk about it. But we have had farmers in various sectors in our agriculture society facing constricted incomes before, and we have done things which helped them. There was a for example, I remember a few years ago something that affected dairy farmers in my State. There was a massive buyout program for dairy farmers, and in a lot of States like Arkansas, there were any number of small farmers that were having a very difficult time who had a chance to start their life on a different basis. I do not want to minimize this. Tobacco has a very high return per acre.

Everybody was heard in this review process. And secondly, they all recognize, too, that this agreement has to be ratified by Congress. The tobacco companies recognize that. That means that all of us who are part of that process are, in effect, parties to this case, too. And that is the way you need to look at this. We are building on their deal. We are not rejecting their agreement. We are building on it. We are not rejecting what the attorneys general did. We are building on it. Look, if it had not been for what they did, we would not be here. I realize that there were two great things that started this. One is what Dr. Kessler and what we did at the FDA, and the fact that our administration was the first one ever willing to take this on. The other was the actions by the attorneys general and the private lawsuits that got the disclosure of the documents that created a total change in the public attitude and the public efforts here. And then long before that, there were the efforts of all of these people here from the public health community who have been telling us all this for years. And they had the public primed for it.

I noted one that I learned about this morning involved Air National Guard planes, for example. That may or may not have anything to do with any problem with planes or anything like that.

Do you believe that? Keep in mind -- if you are a Republican -- and we have heard some Republicans make this argument -- some of those who are leading the charge on this make this argument -- and essentially, what they are saying is, once this is fully implemented and millions of people who currently do not have health care have health care at reasonable prices and protections are in place for consumers across the board, that it will be sufficiently successful and popular that people will not want to repeal it. So the notion is we have got to stop it before people like it too much. Well, part of the argument is sometimes, people come to like things that the government cannot afford anymore. Well, this is -- this is the argument that was made with respect to Social Security; this is the argument that was made to Medicare. It turns out, actually, people liked it, and we could afford it. And unlike the prescription drug plan that was passed by Republicans, which now is very popular with seniors, although at the time that it was passed was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls -- we paid for the Affordable Care Act. It does not add to the deficit. If the assumptions in current law held. Well -- but the assumptions so far not only have held, they have actually exceed expectations. Health care costs have gone up slower since we passed the Affordable Care Act. There were great predictions coming from the Republicans that health care costs would go up even faster; that has not happened. There were predictions that the market places that we are setting up -- essentially, the group plans where people buy health insurance -- would not offer a good deal to consumers. And so far, the bids have come in from insurance companies, and lo and behold, they have actually come under the estimates that the government had so far. So the truth is that every prediction about how bad the Affordable Care Act would be for individual consumers out there has not proven to be true.

I asked ENTITY if he was prepared for significant glitches as the exchanges open. In the first week, first month, first three months, I would suspect that there will be glitches. This is 50 states, a lot of people signing up for something, and there are going to be problems. And I guarantee you, there will be problems because we have got precedent. When Massachusetts, just one state, set this up, it took quite a long time. It took several months before everything was smoothed out. Of course, the same was true with Medicare and Social Security and every other social program that we have set up -- the Children's Health Insurance Program.

You have talked a lot during your time in office about the widening gap between the rich and everybody else. This is a decades-long trend, but a good part of that trend has now taken part -- taken place on your watch. Overwhelming majority of the increase in income in this country went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Why is that happening on your watch? Well, it is one of my biggest concerns. And part of it has to do with the fact that these long-term trends have accelerated. Globalization, combined with technology, have stripped away a lot of the basic security that middle-income people had because a lot of those middle-income jobs have left. Either they were moved overseas, they were replaced with technology -- whether you are talking about a bank teller, a travel agent, a high-level administrator in a lot of companies, if you go to many manufacturers, it is all roboticized. So some of the -- that is part of the trend. Are your efforts not helping with this? The law was passed under a Democratic Congress. Well, no -- there are no doubts that what we have done has helped.

Well, I do not accept that. America is, always been, at its best when everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to succeed. I mean, we are seeing the same trends in Scandinavian countries that historically were -- prided themselves on great equality. We have seen it magnified in less developed countries and emerging markets. So these are global trends that we are going to have to fight against. But if we are educating a workforce that has the skills they need to compete, if we have a tax system that is fair and not rewarding those who can afford high-priced accountants and lawyers, if we are rebuilding our infrastructure in this country, not only to make us more competitive but because those create jobs that cannot be exported, if we are increasing a minimum wage so that it is reflective of the same purchasing power that existed many years ago, if we are creating more ladders of opportunity for people who are locked in neighborhoods that have been abandoned and small towns where factories have closed, if we do those things, then we can lessen the impact of these broader market forces. On the one hand, they create a situation in which consumer goods are cheap and they create a situation in which we can have access to goods and services that we would never have had before. On the other hand, it does create a situation in which a lot of the jobs that are created are at the very top, high-skilled, you know, creative work that cannot be replicated, or at the bottom, low-skilled jobs.

At that point, any president -- not just me -- any president is subject to that kind of blackmail continuously. If you had a Republican president in here and a Democratic speaker said, we are not going to raise the debt ceiling unless you pass background checks on guns; we are not going to pass the debt ceiling unless you raise the corporate income tax by 30 percent, you know, that Republican president would find him or herself in a similar position. Raising the debt ceiling is not raising the debt, it is simply saying Congress is authorizing the Treasury to pay for those things that Congress has already approved. So a potential debt-ceiling crisis approaches, even as the president tries to manage ordinary business. He had hoped to name a new Fed chairman by now, giving Congress time to act this year to find a successor to Ben Bernanke. As he pondered that decision, I asked if the president wants the next Fed chair to change course for the Fed. He began by noting that the Fed is a dual mandate, one part is protecting the currency. Part of that mandate is also full employment, making sure that the economy is growing in such a way that people have the chance to succeed. Should the Fed be doing more in that department? Well, I think that the Fed has to constantly monitor where the economy is moving, but we cannot put the entire burden on the Fed. And this brings us back to the original point about potential government shutdowns or potential default because we are not paying our bills. The -- we have dug ourselves out of a deep hole, and the economy now has grown. We have created jobs for 42 consecutive months. We have created 7.5 million new jobs.

And therefore, in a very profound sense in the modern world, it is more important that people be striving for the kind of spiritual presence of mind and peace of mind that will lead you to use words to build up and to unify, instead of to divide and tear down. And I really do believe that. I think that it is clearly different from any previous time. Words have always been able to wound in letters or speeches or whatever. But the omnipresence of information today and the fact that we are buried in it, it seems to me, imposes an even greater responsibility on people in positions of respect and trust and power to use those words more carefully. The moral crusade elements of the State of the Union Address, teenage pregnancy, as an example, sits well, except that there are investigations into your own conduct which some people say leaves an impression. Is this interfering with your ability to lead that type of crusade? But the one thing that I would say today we live in an age where anybody can say anything and, unlike in previous times, it gets into print. And even if they admit they took money to say it which is what happened in my case a couple of times it still gets wide currency. So there is not much I can do about that. The work I have tried to do to reduce teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births generally is something I have been involved in for many years. The life of these young people was very, very different than my life was when I was their age. Their temptations, their travails, it is very, very different and much more difficult for them. And I think we have got to try to find a way to help them walk back from what is now happening.

Related to that, some people suggest that both your welfare reform proposals and the Contract With America's welfare reform proposal takes such Draconian measures against these unwed teen mothers in terms of limits that what it is likely to do is to drive up the abortion rate, not stop the unwanted pregnancy rate but drive up the abortion rate. Well, I do not agree with that in my proposal, and obviously I do not know what would happen in the others, but let us look at that. The abortion rate has been going down in America. And I think it is been going down for maybe because of all the protest against abortion. But I also think that most Americans have deeply ambivalent feelings. That is, I believe that a majority of Americans are pro-choice and anti-abortion. That is, they do not believe that the decision should be criminalized because there are too many different circumstances where most of us feel that decisions should be left to the people who are involved rather than having a totally legal prohibition. On the other hand, most people think in most circumstances that abortion is wrong and that it should not be done. So the abortion rate is going down in America. It is still very much too high, and we have tried to do some things to make adoption more attractive. And there was a law signed last year, that is gotten almost no notice because it was part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to try to remove the prohibitions or the discriminations in courts across the country in cross-racial adoptions to try to do whatever we could to just encourage more adoptions. But let me back up to your question and to explain, if I might, why I do not agree that our position would cause more abortions. There is the Contract approach which is deny benefits to the second welfare child born out of wedlock. And then this extreme version is deny benefits to any teenager who has a child out of wedlock and to that child for up to 18 years.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreligiousaffairsjournalists", "title": "Interview With Religious Affairs Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-religious-affairs-journalists", "publication_date": "02-02-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Our position is give the States a lot more flexibility, but do not punish the children; take care of their basic needs. And we say do not cut the parents off of public assistance unless, number one, they are bad parents or, number two, they do things which will undermine their ability to either be successful workers or successful parents. So for example, the way our plan works is if you are a teenager and you have a baby, in order to draw the public assistance in a normal way you'd have to stay in school, you'd have to live at home with your parents, and if you lived in a bad home you'd have to live in some other supervised setting. You'd have to cooperate and help identify the father so we could attempt to get the father to pay child support and support the child. If at the end of your education period and training, if 2 years have elapsed and you have not gone to work, then you would have to go to work if there were a job available. And if you turned down a job, you could lose your benefits. Under their proposal, the second problem is, you'd be cut off after 2 years whether there is a job there or not. So the two differences are, I say cut people off after a limited amount of time if there is a job there. They say cut them off altogether. I say only take benefits away from people if they misbehave as parents or in their own responsibilities. They say if you have a child out of wedlock and you are a teenager, you should never get benefits and neither should your child. I will leave it to you to conclude what impact that might have on the abortion rate; I do not know. You have to have more requirements on people; you cannot just continue to perpetuate the present system. But I do not think you should punish the children or punish people for their past mistakes. You should deal with their present conduct. What about the suggestion that, particularly of Speaker Gingrich, that the churches and the charities should be able to take over much of the responsibility, including the financial responsibility that the Government now has for foster children and various other tough social situations?

For example, I think that you might and one of the things that I want to do is to give more flexibility in how to implement welfare reform to State and local government. If they want to involve the church, particularly, for example, in developing supervised settings for young girls and their children who cannot , and should not , be living in their homes because of the problems in their homes, that is the sort of partnership that I would certainly not oppose. But I do not think you can say from that that there is no national interest which should command some taxpayer support to make sure that these children have minimal levels of nutrition and medical care and just the basic things that it seems to me we have got an interest in doing, because we do not want to lose any more of these kids than we have to. The welfare benefits themselves, by the way, are not a problem. So nobody goes on welfare for the check. It is the child care; it is the food stamps; it is the medical care for your children. Therefore, nearly anybody who can will get off and go to work if they can take care of their children and their children will not lose their health care. But do I think the churches should do more? And one of the things that we want to do is to give more operational control of this program to the States and let them use churches or community organizations or others to do whatever they can to repair the families. Much of what the churches already do for instance, Catholic Charities, their money comes from contracts through Federal agencies. In essence, what some of the Republican proposals are asking them to do is to continue doing the sort of work but without those contracts, without the money. Well, it will just be harder for them, will not it? The Government does not we are not a particularly generous country in terms of social welfare. The thing I do not think the American people object to spending tax money on poor people. I think what they object to is spending tax money on a system that perpetuates destructive conduct and irresponsible conduct. I think that the issue is for example, I do not think most Americans really think that it would be a great idea to cut out all spending on poor children in order to afford a capital gains tax cut.

Are you including that in I said today at the prayer breakfast, I do not think anybody in public life, including me, is blameless. I think it is that there are general excuse me, genuine differences that people have on issues, and they ought to express them. But our public life needs more of the spirit of reconciliation, it needs more civility, it needs more humility. Sometimes we think we know things we do not . And I think on debates over public issues, that is true as well. The American people very much want us to they respond to these negative things, but they do not like it. The reason it keeps happening is because they respond to it. The politicians read polls, you know, and they know very often that the negative campaigns work and elect people.

I think the the book that Stephen Carter wrote on that, he makes a better statement about that than I can make, in terms of why they do not accept that about me. I think it is hard to make a case that I have tried to use this. I have never tried to say that for example, I never tried to say that there was a Christian coalition behind anything I did, you know, that God had ordained us to do these following things and I knew it, and anybody that did not was seized by the Devil.

Now, the thing I do think they have to be careful about with their credibility is the very, very hard hits they put on office holders who do not do as they believe.

But at the same time there is this difference that with our tax cuts and the increase in savings, which has already begun, you know it does not take much more than a 1- or 2-percent increase in savings to add billions and billions of dollars to the capital pool. The person that either buys an insurance policy or puts the money in a bank, in a savings account that money is subsequently loaned, then, by the banks or the insurance companies, invested in industry, in growth, in mortgages, and so forth.

Those people who were advocating a tax increase as a method of trying to hold down the deficit and remember, it never has-in all the years past we have had nothing but tax increases and the deficits, and the deficits grew bigger.

We are going to transfer the funds that are necessary to perform the programs. And the trade that we proposed, of the Federal Government taking Medicaid and in return them taking food stamps and the Aid to Dependent Children, was because the increase, annual increase in spending on Medicaid is several times greater than the increase in those other programs. So, the Federal Government, by taking that program on, is going to relieve the States of an increased burden that will begin to be reflected in them having more of their own tax revenues as well as what we give them than they would have had, had they continued participating in Medicaid.

And as a matter of fact, I do not believe it was a purely political position. I know the conventional wisdom is that the Vice President's position was purely political, but he talked to me-I do not know, a day or two after Elian Gonzalez's case became public, weeks and weeks and weeks ago, and said, You know, I am very worried about this process. I am afraid we are going to have a lot of problems with this process. So you know, he personally and privately said that to me long before this bill was introduced and long before it became a matter of big public debate.

He is out there now making his own case to the American people.

That is what he told me a long time ago, purely privately, and long before he ever said anything publicly about it.

Let us talk about guns. Next week, is it fair to say you are dedicating the week to doing what you can to get increased, at least, handgun control? You are going to Maryland to be seen with the Governor as he signs a new handgun control law into law. Then you are going to Colorado, where there is a State ballot initiative that you are backing, and this initiative contains many of the provisions that you seek in Federal law. Question, why no focus on getting new State laws passed, rather than press forward with Federal legislation? And because if you have Federal laws, they can be more efficiently administered. I think gun control is still sort of an explosive term to the American people, because they think we are going to take somebody's guns away from them. And the truth is, all we have tried to do is to take preventive measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. And I think that on the specific measures, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people support us. And Colorado, which is a predominately Republican State, I believe this initiative will pass because they have had experience with it. And I think that it is unconscionable for Congress to hide behind the fact that there are States taking action. Maryland required child trigger locks this week, for example, and required safety training courses and things of that kind for handgun purchases. The State of Massachusetts applied its consumer protection laws to handguns, and Colorado has got this initiative to close the gun show loophole, which I think is very important. But it will take forever and a day for all the States to do that, and the Federal Government ought to do it. You know, it is simply an extension of what we did with the Brady bill.

Gun crime is at a 30-year low in America, not just because we have increased gun prosecutions, which we have, but because we have done more prevention. That is what this is about. You are in a fierce fight on Capitol Hill to get Federal additional gun safety legislation passed. And you set April 20th, the anniversary of the Columbine, Colorado, high school shootings as the goal. Is there any chance that it would get passed by that time? We have a majority for it in both Houses, I think. But the Republican leadership in the Senate may be able to keep it from coming to a vote. They cannot really keep things from coming to a vote in the House, so I think there is a majority for closing the gun show loophole, a majority for banning the importation of large scale ammunition clips. Who could be against that? We have got an assault weapons ban in the country, and then we turn around and make a mockery of it by letting people import these big ammunition clips which they can put on the guns and convert them into assault weapons. Most manufacturers do it anyway. But I think we are making progress. I think the action in these States indicates it; the initiative in Colorado, with the support of many Republican officials in Colorado; the incredibly brave action that Smith & Wesson has taken to try to improve the way it markets and distributes guns and the way those handguns are sold. I hope they will find some resonance among other gun manufacturers. So we are making progress. The interest behind it, the status quo, are very strong. Do you suppose, if I may-I do not mean to interrupt-you say the interest behind this is very strong. As Butch Cassidy said to the Sundance Kid, Who are these guys? Well, the NRA and other groups even to the right of them, and a lot of people in the Congress, in the Republican Party, really agree with them. A handful of Democrats do.

So we ought to close the gun show loophole and do a background check. There are some minor details of adjustment that would have to be undertaken to do these background checks, to make it work when you do these one-day shows out in rural areas. But they can easily be taken care of, and we ought to do it. You mentioned the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate. What I and other reporters talk to them, they say, basically, Look, the President could get a lot of what he wants. He could get the trigger locks for children on handguns. He could get the ban on importing the extra long clips-if the President would simply compromise on the criminal background checks for gun shows. Well, first of all, we already offered a compromise. John Conyers has offered a compromise to Representative Henry Hyde that we were hoping could prevail in the conference. You know, the bill is in conference now. We got a good bill out of the Senate on this gun show loophole because the Vice President broke the tie. The bill is in conference, and Mr. Conyers offered a compromise. Let me say, if you look at the gun shows, they want insta-check. When you do these background checks-let us just look at the facts-when you do the background checks, you can get over 70 percent of the background checks done in the first hour. You can get 95 percent of them done-or over 90 percent in the first day. So they say, Well, just agree to a 24-hour background check or an insta-check system. The real difficulty is, of the roughly 10 percent you cannot finish in one day, the rejection rate in that 10 percent is 20 times higher than the rejection rate in the 90 percent. So what we tried to do was to work out an agreement where we let everybody who would be cleared, be cleared, but we did not have an automatic release for the others, because they are 20 times more likely to have background problems which would not enable them to purchase these guns.

So we have offered a compromise. John Conyers offered a good compromise to Representative Henry Hyde, and I hope and pray that they will take it or something like it. I am willing to compromise, but I do not think that we ought to gut the main purposes of the background check. And again, you know, they say, Well, we have these shows out in the country. They occur on the weekend. They are not all basically at big-city convention centers. But the gun could be deposited with the local sheriff's office for the weekend while the background check is completed, for example. You could deposit the gun and the check and return one or the other or both. It would be easy to work through this if they really wanted to. I just think it is important-I think the child trigger locks are important because the accidental death rate in America of the children are so high, 9 times higher than the next 25 biggest countries combined. But we ought to close the loophole in the Brady law. I am willing to compromise, but I do not want to destroy the purposes of the background check. Our correspondent Maureen Maher has been doing some investigation of some of the loopholes in the Brady law, which turn out to be pretty extensive. If you could close one loophole in the Brady law, what would it be? There are some other loopholes in the Brady law, but if you look at the numbers, it is been quite successful. For all of its problems, it is been quite successful. And when you do the insta-check, you know, we have to do instant checks whenever we can-when you do the insta-check, you actually-you lose some people, because if you cannot wait 3 days, there are some records that have not been logged in, for example, that will not be picked up on the insta-check. But when we passed the Brady bill, that is the best we could do. We had to take a bill that would say a 3-day waiting period, but insta-check whenever possible when it became possible.

Punish people that violate the law; throw the book at them; but in this area alone, let us do not have much prevention, because we are worried about the second amendment or a slippery slope or whatever. I think that we can save so many more lives by sensible prevention and not interfere with legitimate gun owners. ENTITY, did you ever own a gun? I have owned a shotgun. I had a .22 when I was little kid. I had a couple of handguns when I was a Governor. I suppose I was 12 the first time I had target practice, you know, shooting cans off fenceposts.

Not that I know of. I do not know that-if it is true, I do not know it. Any agreement that you know of, the Federal Government has agreed to supply Federal law enforcement officers with Smith & Wesson weapons? No, that was not a part of the agreement. Since then, we have looked into the question of whether we-as have many local jurisdictions looked into the question-whether they can give any kind of preference or consideration to Smith & Wesson in their purchases because they have taken this action. But obviously, whatever they do will have to take account of the need to get the best possible weapons for their law enforcement officials.

So the main thing, when you strip away everything else Smith & Wesson did, what they are really trying to do is to stop providing weapons to people who obviously are careless in enforcing the Brady bill or have a criminal clientele or otherwise just are not taking care of their business. I would have thought when Smith & Wesson came forward, since this had nothing to do with the Brady bill or anything else-this was about having gun dealers clean up their act and gun manufacturers putting the hammer on them to do it, rewarding those that are good, punishing those that are not .

You recently said at a meeting that the First Lady, in her bid for a Senate seat in New York, faces-I think this is your direct quote- a right-wing venom machine that is collecting double tons of money to defeat her. Was that too strong, on reflection? Well, it depends on how you interpret the facts. Richard Viguerie is doing Mayor Giuliani's mail. Mayor Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York, basically said, I am not a Reagan Republican anymore. I am for the Brady bill. I am for the assault weapons ban. I am for the President's crime program. We had a good relationship.

And I think if he is going to do it and get the benefit of it, he can raise a lot of money, because a lot of us folks see beating Hillary or beating the Vice President as another way of going after us for what we have tried to do here on issues like gun safety and vetoing the big tax cuts to keep a balanced budget and the surplus and other things we have fought for. They see that as a way of continuing the battle. He can raise a lot of money that way, but I do not think he should be able to raise it for free. That is, I think he ought to have to be accountable for the rhetoric being used in his behalf and the money that is coming in as a result of that kind of inflammatory right-wing rhetoric. Would you be surprised if I told you that tonight's CBS poll indicates the First Lady is up by 8 points now in the race with Giuliani? She knows what she wants to do for New York. I am really proud of her, and I just-I think these polls will change a lot between now and November. You do not think that what one newspaper has called the wealthy hate Hillary campaign will, in the end, sink her? I think the main thing that she is got to think about is not what they are saying about her but what she is going to say to the people of New York. I think a lot of that is-when you have opposition in politics, a lot of times what they are trying to do is distract you from doing your main job, which is to communicate with the people and to serve the people.

No, I do not think we are losing, and I just talked to our CENTCOM commanders and the folks on the ground. There is no doubt there was a tactical setback, although Ramadi had been vulnerable for a very long time, primarily because these are not Iraqi security forces that we have trained or reinforced. They have been there essentially for a year without sufficient reinforcements, and the number of ISIL that have come into the city now are relatively small compared to what happened in Mosul. But it is indicative that the training of Iraqi security forces, the fortifications, the command-and-control systems are not happening fast enough in Anbar, in the Sunni parts of the country. You have seen actually significant progress in the north, and those areas where the Peshmerga are participating. Those predominantly Shia areas, you are not seeing any forward momentum by ISIL, and ISIL has been significantly degraded across the country. You have got to worry about the Iraqi forces I am getting to that, ENTITY.

What is this conversation actually about? You are under virtually no pressure correct me if I am wrong but you are under virtually no pressure domestically to get more deeply involved in the Middle East. That seems to be one of the downstream consequences of the Iraq invasion 12 years ago. As you said, I am very clear on the lessons of Iraq. I think it was a mistake for us to go in in the first place, despite the incredible efforts that were made by our men and women in uniform.

I know that there are some in Republican quarters who have suggested that I have overlearned the mistake of Iraq, and that, in fact, just because the 2003 invasion did not go well does not argue that we should not go back in. And one lesson that I think is important to draw from what happened is that if the Iraqis themselves are not willing or capable to arrive at the political accommodations necessary to govern, if they are not willing to fight for the security of their country, we cannot do that for them. I think Prime Minister Abadi is sincere and committed to an inclusive Iraqi state, and I will continue to order our military to provide the Iraqi security forces all assistance that they need in order to secure their country, and I will provide diplomatic and economic assistance that is necessary for them to stabilize. But we cannot do it for them, and one of the central flaws I think of the decision back in 2003 was the sense that if we simply went in and deposed a dictator, or simply went in and cleared out the bad guys, that somehow peace and prosperity would automatically emerge, and that lesson we should have learned a long time ago. How do we find effective partners not just in Iraq, but in Syria, and in Yemen, and in Libya that we can work with, and how do we create the international coalition and atmosphere in which people across sectarian lines are willing to compromise and are willing to work together in order to provide the next generation a fighting chance for a better future?

There has been no indication from the Saudis or any other countries that they have an intention to pursue their own nuclear program. Part of the reason why they would not pursue their own nuclear program assuming that we have been successful in preventing Iran from continuing down the path of obtaining a nuclear weapon is that the protection that we provide as their partner is a far greater deterrent than they could ever hope to achieve by developing their own nuclear stockpile or trying to achieve breakout capacity when it comes to nuclear weapons, and they understand that. What we saw at the GCC summit was, I think, legitimate skepticism and concern, not simply about the Iranian nuclear program itself but also the consequences of sanctions coming down. We walked through the four pathways that would be shut off in any agreement that I would be signing off on. Technically, we showed them how it would be accomplished what the verification mechanisms will be, how the UN snapback provisions might work. They were satisfied that if in fact the agreement meant the benchmarks that we have set forth, that it would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and given that, they understand that ultimately their own security and defense is much better served by working with us. Their covert presumably pursuit of a nuclear program would greatly strain the relationship they have got with the United States. I just want you to help me square something.

And yet, you have also argued that the regime in Tehran a regime you have described as anti-Semitic, among other problems that they have is practical, and is responsive to incentive, and shows signs of rationality. So I do not understand how these things fit together in your mind. Well the fact that you are anti-Semitic, or racist, does not preclude you from being interested in survival. It does not preclude you from being rational about the need to keep your economy afloat; it does not preclude you from making strategic decisions about how you stay in power; and so the fact that the supreme leader is anti-Semitic does not mean that this overrides all of his other considerations. You know, if you look at the history of anti-Semitism, ENTITY, there were a whole lot of European leaders and there were deep strains of anti-Semitism in this country  They may make irrational decisions with respect to discrimination, with respect to trying to use anti-Semitic rhetoric as an organizing tool. At the margins, where the costs are low, they may pursue policies based on hatred as opposed to self-interest. But the costs here are not low, and what we have been very clear to the Iranian regime over the past six years is that we will continue to ratchet up the costs, not simply for their anti-Semitism, but also for whatever expansionist ambitions they may have. That is what the sanctions represent. That is what the military option I have made clear I preserve represents. And so I think it is not at all contradictory to say that there are deep strains of anti-Semitism in the core regime, but that they also are interested in maintaining power, having some semblance of legitimacy inside their own country, which requires that they get themselves out of what is a deep economic rut that we have put them in, and on that basis they are then willing and prepared potentially to strike an agreement on their nuclear program.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjefferygoldbergtheatlantic", "title": "Interview with Jeffery Goldberg of The Atlantic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jeffery-goldberg-the-atlantic", "publication_date": "19-05-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

To me that sounds like a little bit of wishful thinking that is going to want to get paid, Hezbollah is going to see, among other groups, might see a little bit of a windfall from these billions of dollars that might pour in. I am not assuming something completely in the other direction either, but I just do not know where your confidence comes from. Well I do not think Jack or anybody in this administration said that no money will go to the military as a consequence of sanctions relief. The question is, if Iran has $150 billion parked outside the country, does the IRGC automatically get $150 billion? Does that $150 billion then translate by orders of magnitude into their capacity to project power throughout the region? And that is what we contest, because when you look at the math, first of all they are going to have to deliver on their obligations under any agreement, which would take a certain period of time. Then there are the mechanics of unwinding the existing restraints they have on getting that money, which takes a certain amount of time. Then Rouhani and, by extension, the supreme leader have made a series of commitments to improve the Iranian economy, and the expectations are outsized. You saw the reaction of people in the streets of Tehran after the signing of the agreement. You have Iranian elites who are champing at the bit to start moving business and getting out from under the restraints that they have been under. And what is also true is that the IRGC right now, precisely because of sanctions, in some ways are able to exploit existing restrictions to have a monopoly on what comes in and out of the country, and they have got their own revenue sources that they have been able to develop, some of which may actually lessen as a consequence of sanctions relief. So I do not think this is a science, and this is an issue that came up with the GCC countries during the summit.

They are not a threat to the region because of their hardware. They have a missile program. We have to think about missile-defense systems and how those are integrated and coordinated. But the big problems we have are weapons going in to Hezbollah, or them sending agents into Yemen, or other low-tech asymmetric threats that they are very effective at exploiting, which they are already doing they have been doing despite sanctions. They will continue to do unless we are developing greater capacity to prevent them from doing those things, which is part of what our discussion was in terms of the security assurances with the GCC countries. You know, if you look at a situation like Yemen, part of the problem is the chronic, endemic weakness in a state like that, and the instability that Iran then seeks to exploit. If you had GCC countries who were more capable of maritime interdiction, effective intelligence, cutting off financing sources, and are more effective in terms of working and training with allied forces in a place like Yemen, so that Houthis cannot just march into Sana'a, well, if all those things are being done, Iran having some additional dollars from sanctions relief is not going to override those improvements and capabilities, and that is really where we have to focus. Hezbollah has a certain number of fighters who are hardened and effective. If Iran has some additional resources, then perhaps they are less strained in trying to make payroll when it comes to Hezbollah, but it is not as if they can suddenly train up and successfully deploy 10 times the number of Hezbollah fighters that are currently in Syria. That is not something that they have automatic capacity to do.  You could buy more rockets and put them in south Lebanon. Well, and the issue though with respect to rockets in south Lebanon is not whether enough money to do so. They have shown a commitment to doing that even when their economy is in the tank. Are we able to interdict those shipments more effectively than we do right now? And that is the kind of thing that we have to continue to partner with Israel and other countries to stop.

There are obviously Jews in America who are immune to the charms of this argument, led by Sheldon Adelson but not only him. All the steps he is taken he meaning you against the State of Israel are liable to bring about the destruction of the state. I have my own theories about why there is this bifurcation in the American Jewish community, and we have discussed this in past interviews, but what is going on? Is this the byproduct of well-intentioned anxiety about Iran, about the explosive growth of anti-Semitism in Europe? Let me depersonalize it a little bit. I consistently received overwhelming majority support from the Jewish community, and even after all the publicity around the recent differences that I have had with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the majority of the Jewish American community still supports me, and supports me strongly. It was 70 percent in the last election. I think that there are a lot of crosscurrents that are going on right now. There is no doubt that the environment worldwide is scary for a lot of Jewish families. You have mentioned some of those trends. You have a Middle East that is turbulent and chaotic, and where extremists seem to be full of enthusiasm and momentum. You have Europe, where, as you have very effectively chronicled, there is an emergence of a more overt and dangerous anti-Semitism. And so part of the concern in the Jewish community is that, only a generation removed from the Holocaust, it seems that anti-Semitic rhetoric and anti-Israeli rhetoric is on the rise. What I also think is that there has been a very concerted effort on the part of some political forces to equate being pro-Israel, and hence being supportive of the Jewish people, with a rubber stamp on a particular set of policies coming out of the Israeli government. So if you are questioning settlement policy, that indicates you are anti-Israeli, or that indicates you are anti-Jewish. If you express compassion or empathy towards Palestinian youth, who are dealing with checkpoints or restrictions on their ability to travel, then you are suspect in terms of your support of Israel.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjefferygoldbergtheatlantic", "title": "Interview with Jeffery Goldberg of The Atlantic", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jeffery-goldberg-the-atlantic", "publication_date": "19-05-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I think that some of those folks may sincerely believe that the Jewish state is consistently embattled, that it is in a very bad neighborhood and either you are with them or against them, and end of story. And they may sincerely believe it. My response to them is that, precisely because I care so deeply about the State of Israel, precisely because I care so much about the Jewish people, I feel obliged to speak honestly and truthfully about what I think will be most likely to lead to long-term security, and will best position us to continue to combat anti-Semitism, and I make no apologies for that precisely because I am secure and confident about how deeply I care about Israel and the Jewish people. I think it would be a moral failing for me as president of the United States, and a moral failing for America, and a moral failing for the world, if we did not protect Israel and stand up for its right to exist, because that would negate not just the history of the 20th century, it would negate the history of the past millennium. And it would violate what we have learned, what humanity should have learned, over that past millennium, which is that when you show intolerance and when you are persecuting minorities and when you are objectifying them and making them the Other, you are destroying something in yourself, and the world goes into a tailspin. And so, to me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I have been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics. These things are indivisible in my mind. But what is also true, by extension, is that I have to show that same kind of regard to other peoples. And I think it is true to Israel's traditions and its values its founding principles that it has to care about those Palestinian kids.

You are not known as an overly emotive politician, but there was a period in which the relationship between you and the prime minister, and therefore the U.S. government and the Israeli government, seemed very fraught and very emotional. Yeah, and I have to say, ENTITY, I completely disagree with that assessment, and I know you wrote that. And I objected to it. I mean, the fact of the matter is that there was a very particular circumstance in which we had a policy difference that should not be papered over because it goes to the nature of the friendship between the United States and Israel, and how we deal government to government, and how we sort through those issues. Now, a couple of things that I'd say at the outset. In every public pronouncement I have made, I said that the bedrock security relationships between our two countries these are sacrosanct. Military cooperation, intelligence cooperation none of that has been affected. I have maintained, and I think I can show that no U.S. president has been more forceful in making sure that we help Israel protect itself, and even some of my critics in Israel have acknowledged as much. I said that none of this should impact the core strategic relationship that exists between the United States and Israel, or the people-to-people relations that are so deep that they transcend any particular president or prime minister and will continue until the end of time. But what I did say is that when, going into an election, Prime Minister Netanyahu said a Palestinian state would not happen under his watch, or there discussion in which it appeared that Arab-Israeli citizens were somehow portrayed as an invading force that might vote, and that this should be guarded against this is contrary to the very language of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which explicitly states that all people regardless of race or religion are full participants in the democracy.

Now that makes, understandably, folks both in Israel and here in the United States uncomfortable. But the one argument that I very much have been concerned about, and it has gotten stronger over the last 10 years ... it is less overt than the arguments that a Sheldon Adelson makes, but in some ways can be just as pernicious, is this argument that there should not be disagreements in public. So a lot of times the criticism that was leveled during this period including from you, ENTITY was not that you disagreed with me on the assessment, but rather that it is dangerous or unseemly for us to air these disagreements You did not make that argument I did not make that argument. I spend half my life airing those arguments. But you understand what I am saying, ENTITY. I would get letters from people saying, Listen, ENTITY, I completely support you. I agree with you on this issue, but you should not say these things publicly. Now the truth of the matter is that what we said publicly was fairly spare and mild, and then would be built up it seemed like an article a day, partly because when you get in arguments with friends it is a lot more newsworthy than arguments with enemies. Well, and it is the same problem that I am having right now with the trade deals up on Capitol Hill. The fact that I agree with Elizabeth Warren on 90 percent of issues is not news. That we disagree on one thing is news. But my point, ENTITY, is that we are at enough of an inflection point in terms of the region that trying to pretend like these important, difficult policy questions are not controversial, and that they do not have to be sorted out, I think is a problem.

But the most important thing, I think, that we can do right now in strengthening Israel's position is to describe very clearly why I have believed that a two-state solution is the best security plan for Israel over the long term; for me to take very seriously Israel's security concerns about what a two-state solution might look like; to try to work through systematically those issues; but also, at the end of the day, to say to any Israeli prime minister that it will require some risks in order to achieve peace. How do you weigh those risks against the risks of doing nothing and just perpetuating the status quo? My argument is that the risks of doing nothing are far greater, and I ultimately it is important for the Israeli people and the Israeli government to make its own decisions about what it needs to secure the people of that nation. But my hope is that over time that debate gets back on a path where there is some semblance of hope and not simply fear, because it feels to me as if ... all we are talking about is based from fear. As a Jewish-majority democracy. We talked about this once. Kibbutzim, and Moshe Dayan, and Golda Meir, and the sense that not only are we creating a safe Jewish homeland, but also we are remaking the world. We are repairing it. We are going to do it the right way. We are going to make sure that the lessons we have learned from our hardships and our persecutions are applied to how we govern and how we treat others. And it goes back to the values questions that we talked about earlier those are the values that helped to nurture me and my political beliefs. It is interesting, when I spoke to some leaders of Jewish organizations a few months back, I said to them, it is true, I have high expectations for Israel, and they are not unrealistic expectations, they are not stupid expectations, they are not the expectations that Israel would risk its own security blindly in pursuit of some idealistic pie-in-the-sky notions.

The same values that animate our discussion on human rights and our concern that people on the other side of the world who may be tortured or jailed for speaking their mind or worshipping the same values that lead us to speak out against anti-Semitism.

Those are decisions that I have to make every time I deploy U.S. forces. Those are choices that we make with respect to drones, and with respect to our intelligence agencies. And so when I spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu, for example, about can we come up with a peace plan, I sent out our top military folks to go through systematically every contingency, every possible concern that Israel might have on its own terms about maintaining security in a two-state agreement, and what would it mean for the Jordan Valley, and what would it mean with respect to the West Bank, and I was the first one to acknowledge that you cannot have the risk of terrorists coming up right to the edge of Jerusalem and exposing populations.

I think that is an indication of my great feeling for Clayton Yeutter. I happen to believe that Earl Butz has done an excellent job of defending the interests of agriculture across the board. He has been a great exponent of the free marketplace. He has fought Government restrictions so that farmers can run their farms as they see fit.

In addition, we can use discretely and properly our surpluses for other reasons-and I do not want to expand for other reasons but it is better to put it that way than to come out and say, yes, we are going to do it as a hard-line bargaining principle. We can use it effectively, and we have and will. ENTITY, you voiced your support for Secretary Butz and pointed to his support among the farm community. There has been some concern among farm people in connection with that, that the Secretary has not been sufficiently involved in these grain negotiations as compared to State Department people. What input does Secretary Butz have? We have a grain subcommittee of the Economic Policy Board, and on at least three occasions where I have attended those meetings, Secretary Butz has been present, and I have had several meetings.

Is this being taken into consideration in your planning? We keep a daily check on world grain supplies. And from our point of view, fortunately, we are about the only grain supplier left in the world.

Now, this is a mammoth Federal intervention in the capital marketplace, which is the exact opposite, really, of what you have always said-as a governmental policy, you wanted hands off. Now, does this mean you have given up on the idea that the oil companies can come up with alternate sources if you decontrol oil prices? Well, that authority is primarily for the purpose of undertaking the financing of the synthetic fuel programs which are new, where there could be some failure, where there is a certain degree of uncertainty as to whether they will be productive, whether they will be financially responsible. You have to have, in my opinion, this kind of authority to get those synthetic fuel programs underway. And there are some other areas in addition to synthetic fuels, but it is basically an instrument like the RFC back in the '30s and '40s for example, the synthetic rubber program which was financed by RFC. This is not an attempt to take over the private financing of ordinary and regular programs and projects, but it does aim at helping us exploit breakthroughs in the scientific world so that synthetic fuels can be more readily made available to the public.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersomaha", "title": "Interview With Reporters in Omaha.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-reporters-omaha", "publication_date": "01-10-1975", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

ENTITY, you have been urging the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to report out on the Sinai agreements by Friday. The problem there is that the two parties Israel and Egypt had agreed by, I think, early next week to sign the necessary documents and start the implementation of the withdrawal and the change of lines and so forth. Israel has said that it will not start the implementation until the Congress approves the utilization of up to 200 American technicians. So, we want it through by the time of the signing so that Israel and Egypt will both sign. Egypt has already signed, but Israel has this reservation. So, time is of the essence, so we can get both of those parties to move toward the actual implementation. You have said that you would like to see the orderly development of nuclear power, and this would certainly be a help in gaining our independence as far as energy is concerned. What do you see in the future for getting it straightened out so that we can look at it as a hopeful sign? We have had too many plant cancellations of nuclear power in the last 12 months very few if any for safety reasons, most of them for financing reasons. We expect there will be a resurgence of these projects in the months ahead. In the meantime, of course, we are spending vast amounts of money in the Federal Government to make even more certain the safety of nuclear powerplants. It is interesting to point out, however, of all of the nuclear powerplants in operation today in the United States, there has never been one fatality not one. But that does not mean we should not continue to find safer and better ways for the development of nuclear power.

We have always said the answer to the energy problem for the United States is, one, stimulation of new sources and conservation of the energy we have. Every document I have ever sent to the Congress, every statement I have ever made, emphasizes both new sources of energy and conservation of those that we have. In my energy program that I submitted in January of this year, we put a considerable amount of emphasis on conservation. The United States has squandered energy; we squander energy today.

I set that forth in a crime message to the Congress where I said, Our concern today ought to be for the victims of crime. The crime message that I sent to the Congress calls for mandatory sentences for those that participate in a crime of violence using a gun, and we have urged the courts to increase their confinement of convicted criminals. Too many criminals today, after they have been convicted, are put off on probation. There ought to be a penalty for the committing of a crime, and that means confinement. Whether it is 6 months or some other term, I believe mandatory sentences are required in certain crimes.

See, I have a degree in economics myself. But I do remember that when I was getting my degree, it was more or less a standard acceptance in economics that the business cycle, so called, and the lean periods previous to that are-what we now call recessions and depressions-when they did occur, that usually it was when the government had gone beyond a certain point in the percentage of gross national product that it was taking.

I have been held up as eating my young, that we have been hostile to the poor and our tax program benefits the rich. How can a program that cuts taxes evenly, percentagewise, across the board-thus leaving the same rate of progression in our progressive tax system-how can that be beneficial to the rich and detrimental to the others? How can it be unfair to the people of lower income or the poor to reduce inflation from double digits-12.5 percent when we came here-down to a third of that or less, less than a third of that. When the people with the least-let us take someone with $10,000 of income between-through 2 years, 1979 and 1980-before we got here. By the end of 1980 that $10,000 would only buy $8,000 worth. He was getting $5,000 a year. He got a $1,000 cut in his ability to buy each year. That was probably the worst tax on the elderly with fixed incomes, the worst tax on the poor who have to spend most of their earnings on subsistence, on the necessities. The person with luxury income who spends a minor portion of it on necessities and the rest on luxuries, they were not really penalized as much by inflation. So, I think everything we have done has been beneficial to everyone at every level. You mention the elderly. If I could ask about that.

Again, this was-if you will remember, that was the issue of the 1982 campaign. We were guilty of trying to tell the Congress and our opponents that social security was facing financial disaster and it could hit it as early as July 1983. They denied that. I remember hearing the Speaker of the House, himself, deny that that was true. And then after the election was over, we all got together in a bipartisan group and without any animus, came up with a plan to save social security because it would be broke by July of 1983.

Well, that is what the enterprise zones are all about, picking those hard-hit spots, both rural and urban, and generating employment through the use of tax incentives. And so far, a number of States have gotten tired of waiting for the Congress to act and do it at a national level, and have put in their own enterprise zone programs. And every one of them is proving tremendously successful. But, knowing that you might get around to unemployment, I just decided some figures might be of interest to you. You represent two, four, six, eight States-and all in the same region.

I will be very interested in seeing what it comes out as from February.

Maybe-and, you know, all of your States, particularly there in the Sunbelt, you are going to have to recognize also that your reduction in unemployment may be a little slower because of the migration to the Sunbelt. And that means that newcomers coming in, without jobs and looking for jobs, are temporarily going to distort the figures. Back on the economic issue for just 1 minute, back to the budgetary thing-when you campaigned for ENTITY, one of your promises, of course, was to balance the budget by 1984. I wonder what you look at as the main reason for that. What happened to Reaganomics that made it not work like you wanted it to? Nothing happened to Reaganomics. And I am glad you asked this question. Yes, I had the help of some of the finest economists in the country in working on the program that I call the economic recovery program. And toward the end of the summer, 1980, I announced that plan, and based our projections-that, yes, it could balance the budget by '83, based on all the projections that those economists at that time-before the election. Between that announcement and November, that projection was no longer valid, because the economy in 1980 was deteriorating so fast, and had not been projected to do so by any of these notable economists. So, it continued to worsen, and by the time of the Inaugural-then even a later time-was beyond any prediction; it had continued to get worse. Inflation, then, for '79 and '80 had been double digit both years. Now, when I started-you have got to remember that the ENTITY comes in not with his own budget. You are still bound until the following October by the budget of the previous administration. Nor was my program in effect. We were still trying to get it. And in July of 1981 was when the further big dip came. Now, some economists have said, well, we had a 1979, '80 recession, and then the thing that happened in July was another-a different recession. And the bottom fell out with the interest rates that stayed high, the automobile industry, the housing industry-either one of which can start a recession by itself.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsoutheastregionaleditorsforeignanddomesticissues", "title": "Interview With Southeast Regional Editors on Foreign and Domestic Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-southeast-regional-editors-foreign-and-domestic-issues", "publication_date": "12-03-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3128, "text": "So, nothing of what happened and the great surge to 10.8 percent in unemployment-none of that could be attributed to our program, because our program had not started. And then, as our program was implemented-and remember, it was only implemented in stages. It took 3 years to get the 25-percent tax cut. Other things that were implemented-and we never got all of the spending cuts. As a matter of fact, we got a little less than half of what we asked in spending cuts. And that is to this day. Now, I could turn around and say that maybe the recovery might have been even better if we had gotten-remember that one stage of our tax cut-10 percent of it-was going to go into effect retroactively to January of 1981, and we did not get it then. And when we did get it, after the drop had occurred, it was only 5 percent, and it did not go into effect until October, which meant that it was about 1 1/4 percent when it only went on for 3 years-or 3 months. And so, I have to say that all of the recovery has taken place after our program went into effect, and none of our program was in effect when the bottom fell out. ENTITY, I want to get clear on one thing. Are you-your comments earlier about this bipartisan-bipartisan meetings over the deficit-when you said you are now pursuing your own plan with other Republican leaders. Are you saying that you have abandoned altogether any hope of reaching any kind of compromise with the Democrats? Are you through talking with them? I hope that maybe when we come forth with this plan and say, Look, here is something now, we will tell you, we are ready to go with; here is a plan -I would like to have, because we cannot get such a plan unless we have bipartisan support. I would like to think that they would do it. But what I meant was that to sit down with them and start from scratch to negotiate, they were very unwilling. We had great difficulty getting them to even meet. And, finally, one meeting they just simply walked away on one issue and refused to talk. And it was not very encouraging to us. Can you still-you do not have any idea about how soon you might have a plan ready to put forward? I am hoping- -before the elections, though.

And some of the economists-and some of them, I think, are trying to scare the Congress into recognizing that we should be dealing with it. Not scare you, but the Congress. Not scare me, no, because, look, I am not one to underestimate the deficits. I have been talking about them for 30 years. Is it impossible for us to-well, no, you cannot remember; all of you are too young, so it would have to be history for you-but for almost half a century the other party has been in control, as I said earlier, of both Houses of the Congress. And Congress is the only one that can deal with these things. A ENTITY has a veto power, but ENTITY cannot spend a single dime. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives ENTITY the right to spend anything. But for almost this half-century we have every year run deficits. It was almost a trillion dollars by the time we came here. And there were many of us who opposed this. And we were told at the time that the national debt did not matter because we owed it to ourselves. We were told the deficit spending and a little inflation was necessary to maintain prosperity. Well, some of us did not think that added up. And I can show you speeches I made 20, 25 years ago in which I said inflation cannot continue without going out of control eventually. You cannot go down this road. The deficit spending and the piling up of the debt that-it has never worked in history; it never will. Well, now, suddenly, with the big dip that came in July in that recession, with millions more people added-the unemployed, who became wards of the government, which increased the spending, but who were no longer paying the taxes, which decreased that; the very fact that we improve the inflation figure also militated against government revenues, because inflation is a source of tax increase.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsoutheastregionaleditorsforeignanddomesticissues", "title": "Interview With Southeast Regional Editors on Foreign and Domestic Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-southeast-regional-editors-foreign-and-domestic-issues", "publication_date": "12-03-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, all of this, for them now to suddenly become aware of deficits-and yet, when you try to talk to them, what is the only answer that they have for curbing the deficit? Well-and they will also agree to cut defense spending. Well, defense spending right now is down to a little more than a fourth of the budget. Defense spending, historically, the days of Jack Kennedy, was virtually a half of the budget. Under Jack Kennedy, it was 47.8 percent. So, the-and the increase in taxes-they doubled taxes in the 5 years before we got here. And the deficits increased, because when you increase taxes, they increase spending. And may I point to the 1983 budget resolution passed by the Democratic majority in the House. And they really did not think that it would ever amount to anything or be passed by anyone else. But, if you will remember, they described it as a reaffirmation of Democratic principles. And it did call for somewhere around $70 billion in increased taxes. But it also called for that much increased spending for new programs, social programs. So, this was where we philosophically just were in complete disagreement-that they think you can solve the budget deficit by increasing taxes. They do not even pay attention to the fact that this could subvert the recovery that we re now having and put us back where we were. But beyond that, they have made it plain, and, indeed, their own candidates talk of new spending programs. When you are oh the campaign trail, how much of an issue are you going to make of the school prayer issue and the abortion? Well, I am hoping that before I get out there that we will have the school prayer amendment passed in the Congress. And here again, the effort that is being made to portray that as someway, somehow we are talking compulsory prayer; we are going to compel the schools. I am sure there would be some schools-all we are asking is that they have the right to if they want to. But I think it is a right that we had for the bulk of our entire history in this country.

There is a lot of reports, including administration reports, that there are more illegal drugs coming into this country than ever, especially cocaine-much of it coming through Florida-despite intensified enforcement in Florida and elsewhere. Would you say that that represents a failure of that drug strategy?  Well now, wait a minute-I am going to have to ask, but-you know, I have to tell you something about this room. I do not know whether you have noticed it or not-out there in that center of the room under the dome, you kind of disappear a little on me. I am having so much fun. I was asking about the illegal drug shipments into the country. And the evidence is that there is more illegal drugs coming in than ever before-at least in recent years and despite intensified enforcement in Florida and other places. And what I am wondering is whether you think that because of that that there is going to be a need to change the drug enforcement strategy, and whether the drug enforcement strategy that you have employed has been a success? Then this-if this is a new figure that I have not obtained-our task force in Florida, which is the first time that we have ever put the Federal Government, the State government, and the local authorities, the drug enforcement authorities, and the military involved in trying to head this off-this shipment from out of the country coming in-was so successful in Florida that this is where, why we went to 12 such task forces all around the country on our borders to try and have the same success. When you have got the coastlines that we have got and the borders that we have, I do not think you will ever solve the problem totally by intercepting the drugs. The answer is going to be the kind that has Nancy down in Houston. To really be successful, you are going to have to take the customer away from the pusher. And this we are embarked on also, as you know, with great efforts all through the country. But the figures that we have is that-and the reason for the rest of the other 11 task forces were-that we so slowed it down in Florida and reduced it in Florida, that they began seeking new entry points around the country.

It is not just a fellow on a corner with something in his pocket to sell. It is coming in in freighters. It is coming in in airplanes and everything else. But we have stepped up our efforts and have been tremendously successful. Do you think the military can be used to stop, like, particularly some of the drug smuggling that is coming in on that Mobile corridor? What we used was we used their radar facilities; also their air surveillance for information that we needed. I do not think they actually participated in any of the arrests, but they provided the surveillance and the information for us. If they can see an enemy coming in, I can see that. I had just one final question for you related to defense. This year for the third year now you are requesting in your defense budget funds for chemical weapons production. And of course, Congress has narrowly defeated these proposals for the last 2 years. There is been a suggestion made in the last week by some Democratic House Members that any proposal for funding for chemical weapons should be tied to legislation requiring the administration to make a new initiative on talks with the Soviets on chemical weapons control. So, my question is, first, do you think that the United States is doing all it can in this area? Would you agree to a proposal like that? And also, do you see any reasons now why Congress might be willing to pass the chemical weapons appropriation when they have not been? If they were responsible, they would, because the very thing that they are talking about we are going to be ready very shortly to table a treaty for discussion of banning chemical weapons. But the reason why they would be more of help if they would okay the spending is, how better to get the other side, then, to agree to a treaty with us banning this; how much better able we will be if they know that if they do not do that, they will have to face the fact that we have chemical weapons that we can use against them.

I do believe that the Federal Government has an obligation to do more to try to help California deal with the problems of illegal immigration. And I have worked hard on that, along with Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. We have almost doubled the border guards in southern California; we have increased our sending the illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crimes back home. We have given money to California for the very first time to deal with the costs of imprisonment. I have tried to get much more money for education and health care costs of immigration to California. But 187 operates primarily against children. It says, kick the children out of the health clinics. That could cause health problems for the general population. It says, kick the children out of the schools, which means teachers are turned into police officers. It means that the kids can be on the street causing problems for themselves and for others. We have already got too many children on the street. So I believe we have to do more. I found a big immigration mess when I became ENTITY 21 months ago. But this is not the answer, in my opinion, and I hope the voters will turn out and vote and reject 187. It is a way of dividing our people, it is clearly unconstitutional, and it is looking for easy answers to a tough problem. After all, some of the people that are for 187 are part of the problem. When Governor Wilson was Senator Wilson, he responded to the powerful forces in California that wanted more illegal immigrants in California to do work. He sponsored legislation to make it more difficult to remove illegal immigrants from the workplace by going easier on the employers. Now he, all of a sudden, has turned 180 degrees on this issue. But this is a complicated issue without a simple solution. I am committed to working with you to find a solution. I hope that our listeners, our viewers, will turn out and vote on Tuesday and vote against 187, and I hope they will come to the Kaiser Center in Oakland tomorrow where I am going to have a rally at 2 o'clock. if 187 is approved, do you think it will affect the NAFTA treaty with Mexico?

And you know, I think it is certainly a positive development when the Russians and the Syrians both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons. This is what we have been asking for, not just over the last week or the last month, but for the last couple of years, because these chemical weapons pose a significant threat to all nations and to the United States in particular. That is why 98 percent of humanity has said we do not use these. That protects our troops and it protects children like the ones that we saw on those videos inside of Syria. I have to say that it is unlikely that we would've arrived at that point, where there were even public statements like that, without a credible military threat to deal with the chemical weapons use inside of Syria. But we are going to run this to ground. And John Kerry and the rest of my national security team will engage with the Russians and the international community to see, can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious. You know, one reason that this may have a chance of success is that even Syria's allies, like Iran, detest chemical weapons. Iran, you know, unfortunately was the target of chemical weapons at the hands of Saddam Hussein back during the Iraq/Iran War. And so we may be able to arrive at a consensus in which it does not solve the underlying problems of a civil war in Syria, but it does solve the problem that I am trying to focus on right now, which is making sure that you do not have over 400 children gassed indiscriminately by these chemical weapons. Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general, says not only control the stockpiles of chemical weapons, but then go ahead and destroy them. He is ready to take that to the U.N. Security Council. That is a lot better than deterring the Syrians from going ahead and using these chemical weapons. Absolutely, and that is why we are going -- we are going to take this seriously, but I have to consistently point out that we have not seen these kinds of gestures up until now.

We have to maintain this pressure, which is why I will still be speaking to the nation tomorrow about why I think this is so important. Well, you know, I think that it is important for Assad to understand that, you know, the chemical weapons ban which has been in place is one that the entire civilized world, just about, respects and observes. It is something that protects our troops, even when we are in the toughest war theaters, from being threatened by these chemical weapons. It is something that protects women and children and civilians because these weapons, by definition, are indiscriminate; they do not just target somebody in uniform. And you know, I suspect that some of Assad's allies recognize the mistake he made in using these weapons and it may be that he is under pressure from them as well. You know, again, this does not solve the underlying terrible conflict inside of Syria, but if we can accomplish this limited goal without taking military action, that would be my preference. On the other hand, if we do not maintain and move forward with a credible threat of military pressure, I do not think we will actually get the kind of agreement I'd like to see.

That can be accomplished and it does not solve the broader political situation. I would say to Mr. Assad, we need a political settlement so that you are not slaughtering your own people and, by the way, encouraging some elements of the opposition to engage in some terrible behavior as well. You know, what I am thinking about is right now, though, how do we make sure that we can verify that we do not have chemical weapons that can be used, not only inside of Syria, but potentially could drift outside of Syria? He said in an interview with Charlie Rose that if you, United States, attack, launch military strikes, he said he will respond anythinghe said expect anything, not only from him, but from his allies. That sounds like a threat to the United States. Assad does not have a lot of capability. He has capability relative to children. He has capability relative to an opposition that is still getting itself organized and are not professional, trained fighters. He does not have a credible means to threaten the United States. His allies, Iran and Hezbollah, could potentially engage in asymmetrical strikes against us, but frankly, the kind of threats that they could pose against us are typical of the kinds of threats that we are dealing with around the world that I have spoken of recently, which is embassies that are being threatened, you know, U.S. personnel in the region. Those are threats that we deal with on an ongoing basis. They are always of concern. Obviously, we saw the situation in Yemen just a few weeks ago where we wanted to respond by getting some of our folks out of there.

Well, as you saw on the President's statement yesterday and as you have seen all week from the President and the rest of us, we have been encouraged by bipartisan progress on this very important package of proposals. This was simply -- while very important -- a first stage in an effort to get sensible, common-sense legislation that would reduce gun violence in America while protecting Americans' Second Amendment rights signed into law. But we certainly welcome this development. And now that everybody has their cards out on the table in terms of the budget, is there going to be -- do you think that there will be some kind of push for negotiations in the short term on a grand bargain? Or will this kind of linger until this summer when we have to raise the debt ceiling again? Well, the President is interested in reaching a bipartisan compromise built around the principles that are clear in his budget proposal as soon as possible. The House has passed a budget. The Senate has passed a budget. The President has presented a budget. The President has been engaged in a process of having conversations with lawmakers of both parties; in this case, reaching out directly to Republican lawmakers to find out if they are open to the general principle that we should approach our deficit challenges in a balanced way so that we can protect seniors, secure the middle class, allow our economy to grow, and reduce the deficit in a responsible way. That is the President's approach that is embodied in the budget that he presented yesterday. So whose court is the ball in now? Is it incumbent upon Republicans to -- he said in the Rose Garden yesterday that he wants to see Republicans in the coming days show that they are serious about deficit reduction. So do they have to take some action now to get things going? I would refer you to what the President said. We believe that the President's budget proposal, which incorporates the offer that he made to Speaker Boehner at the end of the year -- which by any definition represents a good faith effort that meets the Republicans at least halfway -- that therefore the Republicans ought to examine that and let the American people know whether or not they are too interested in finding common ground rather than embracing ideological purity.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney241", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-241", "publication_date": "11-04-2013", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It is an attempt to find common ground so that we can deal with our fiscal challenges on behalf of the whole country and move forward. And the immigration Gang of Eight has agreed that before anybody that is here illegally can be on a path to a green card, that we need to have 100 percent surveillance of our border in Mexico, and I think it is 90 percent apprehension rate, which seems like a pretty high bar to meet. Is that requirement in line with the President's vision for what a real path to citizenship is? Well, the President believes, as he made clear in his blueprint that has been available publicly for a long time now, that there has to be a clear pathway to citizenship available; that comprehensive immigration reform must include both that and must continue the focus that he is placed on border security. I would note that there are a variety of ways to measure improvements and progress when it comes to security. And we can point you to a number of facts, which are that apprehensions are down by nearly 80 percent since 2000 and down 50 percent since 2008. And, at the same time, we have increased boots on the ground along the border to more than 21,000 personnel. That is more than at any time in our history. This is progress that has been broadly recognized by Democrats and Republicans, and demonstrates the President's commitment to border security. When it comes to the actual legislation, we wait for that legislation to be produced, and we will assess it when it is. We absolutely commend the progress that has been made, but the President remains committed to the proposition that the result has to be a bill that can earn bipartisan support as well as his signature. ENTITY, you saw the reaction yesterday, probably from many reporters, on the chained CPI inclusion in the budget. Even one Republican congressman called it an attack on seniors. Is there any concern at the White House that this is something that will make it -- that Republicans will use to avoid the grand bargain and even to hurt Democrats politically? The President's budget represents a compromise.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney241", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-241", "publication_date": "11-04-2013", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3148, "text": "The inclusion of entitlement reform, specifically chained CPI and means testing of Medicare, comes at the specific behest and request of Republican leaders, as you know. Back in December of 2012, Speaker of the House Boehner said that he wants to use a new method of calculating benefits for entitlement programs known as chained CPI. Again, a Republican congressionalist is citing another news source, Bloomberg. A Republican congressional aide said that Boehner is pressing harder for the CPI revision than for other entitlement changes. Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader -- this is quoting the Wall Street Journal -- said bipartisan agreement on higher Medicare premiums for the wealthy and increase in the Medicare eligibility age, and slowing cost-of-living increases for Social Security could move both parties closer to a budget deal. And by that, a budget deal he meant and everyone meant in December of last year, a budget deal that would be balanced and include revenues, which obviously was part of the President's approach. Mitch McConnell said again that chained CPI was something that he wanted as part of a broader deal. And cynical attempts to make it otherwise by some represent I think dissonance within the Republican Party, and we have seen plenty of condemnation from conservatives and Republicans of that sort of flagrantly ridiculous and cynical attempt to disown a proposal that emanated from Republican leaders. It is the responsible thing to do to try to find common ground. To find common ground you need to meet the other side halfway. You need to accept you are not going to get everything you want. You need to accept things that the other side wants. The three proposals I mentioned that Republican leaders said they wanted as part of a bipartisan deal that would include revenue as well as entitlement reforms -- of those three, the President has included two in his budget. By definition, two out of three is more than halfway. So the President expects and hopes that members of the common-sense caucus will recognize the common-sense nature of his proposal, how it demonstrates as a seriousness of purpose that should infuse everyone's efforts here in Washington when it comes to addressing our budget challenges, and that we can move forward. This is the spirit in which the President had dinner with a dozen Republican senators last night, the second such dinner in recent weeks. And it is the spirit in which he will approach his conversations with Republicans going forward.

Well, there is a meeting, a roundtable, that is being held with other members of the administration, and that is part of our ongoing engagement with the financial sector and with the business community. As you know, we engage with the business community all the time. I would have to take the question. Not that I am aware of. The President met yesterday with the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who today expressed their opposition to the forced feeding of hunger strike inmates in Guantanamo. What reaction did the President give to that opposition in their meeting yesterday? First of all, what I can tell you is that you know our commitment to close Gitmo. It is a commitment shared by the former President, by military leaders, and other Republicans, including Senator McCain. And we continue to be committed to closing that facility in our national security interests. I do not have any specific response to what is happening now, except to say that the President remains committed to closing Gitmo for national security reasons. But is he aware of this hunger strike? Is he following it? The President obviously is updated on a number of issues. I have not had a specific conversation with him about this. In the 2008 campaign, the President, then-candidate Obama, issued a statement saying, I will not touch Social Security. So a number of Democrats are now accusing the President of breaking his word. You just said it was a Republican proposal, so why is a Democratic President issuing a Republican budget? Because he is President of the whole country, and he believes we need to reach a budget compromise that is balanced, that allows the economy to grow, that secures a rising and thriving middle class, and invests in the economy of the future while reducing our deficits in a responsible way. His budget is proof that you can do that; that you do not need to take the path embodied by the House Republican budget, which would dramatically slice investments in education; would block grant Medicaid, cut it dramatically, harming families who have children with disabilities; would voucherize Medicare, shifting costs onto seniors at an average of thousands of dollars per year, all the while giving a massive tax break to wealthy individuals and the most well-connected.

But is this who he really is, and progressives are misunderstanding what he truly believes in? The President believes that it is in the overall interest of the nation's economy and middle class that we reach a budget deal of the kind the he presented yesterday. And the reason that is, is because we need to continue to grow the economy and create jobs. That is the best thing we can do for middle-class families and for the people he fights for every day. In order to achieve that deal, he recognizes he will have to make some tough choices and that Democrats will have to accept things that they would not otherwise want to do; but so, too, will Republicans. Republicans who suggest that the only way to move forward in deficit reduction is to put the burden entirely on seniors and the middle class are wrong, and it will not be accepted and it is not an approach that this President will accept. And it is an approach that, by the way, was the center of debate for an entire year in a presidential election and the American people roundly rejected it. He has accepted as part of his offer to the Speaker of the House, which is included in his budget proposal, a compromise position and entitlement reforms that he can accept as part of a broader deal that asks everybody to participate in the effort and that invests in our economy, and secures and enhances the middle class. The cloture was invoked with a pretty strong margin. Does the President have any sense of whether the voices from Newtown, whether public attitudes really did make any impact on the Senate?

{"id": 3151, "text": "The President has no doubt whatsoever that the voices of the Newtown families and the voices of Americans across the country that were raised this week as part of an effort to urge the Senate to move forward, and not block procedurally the progress on this legislation, had a positive effect and may well have been decisive. The President has said all along, and you heard him in Hartford on Monday, that Congress will do the right thing if the American people speak up, if they raise their voices, if they make their views known. And as he said then, it is not about him; it is about the American people and what the right, common-sense thing is to do when it comes to taking action to reduce gun violence. On the second part, as I said to Josh, this is an important milestone, but it is an early milestone. And there is no question that challenges will continue to be placed in the way of making progress on passing common-sense legislation that would reduce gun violence. But we are obviously very pleased with today's vote. Does the President have real concerns about the assault weapons ban, the size of ammunition clips, as being things that will not be able to move forward? Reinstatement of the assault weapons ban makes eminent sense. Making sure that military-style assault weapons are not available on the streets of the United States is a common-sense approach. It does not infringe upon Americans' Second Amendment rights. Limiting the size of ammunition clips will save lives, and it is not an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of the American people. The President strongly supports Second Amendment rights. So he insists -- as the American people insist, as the families of the victims of Newtown and Tucson and Aurora and Oak Creek and Virginia Tech, and so many other places across the country insist -- that the United States Senate on each of these holds itself to account, that senators vote on these aspects of the legislation, that they do not filibuster or use other procedural measures to avoid being held to account. And if they have to vote no, they should vote no and explain why, rather than hide behind procedure and other parliamentary tricks to obscure what is really happening.

The President's commitment to border security is evident not just in his blueprint, which makes clear that border security -- So you do not want to weigh in one way or the other, whether they should include it or not? Again, border security absolutely must be part of comprehensive immigration. If you have legislation that demonstrates what is in it, I'd be interested in seeing it. They are still working on it. When it emerges, we will evaluate it. What is a take-away from the dinner last night? A different group of senators -- do you think this is something that is gaining momentum? The President feels like it is a worthwhile exercise and it is not just a sort of for-show thing? Well, it is certainly not for show in the President's mind. The President believes that both dinners and all of his engagements with Republicans have been constructive and useful. He is very much of the mind that exploring the possibility of finding common ground is in the interest of the American people and the American economy, and it is in the interest of trying to find bipartisan solutions to a whole range of issues, not just our budget and fiscal challenges -- but immigration reform, reducing gun violence, taking steps to enhance America's energy independence and security, making sure that we continue to invest in education and research and development. So there are a variety of arenas here where the possibility of bipartisan compromise exists. In spite of the polarization that does pertain here in Washington, it is also the case that whether it is on gun violence and the vote that we have talked about that happened today, or on immigration reform, or within the context of at least the discussions that the President has been having, there is at least evidence of the potential for bipartisan cooperation. Did either one of the dinners in of themselves propel what we saw on the Senate floor today on gun control or the progress being made on immigration?

As the President made clear when he talked about it from the beginning after the election, he wanted to see progress emerge from the Senate through the Gang of Eight process because he believed that would produce the best opportunity for bipartisan legislation that reflected his principles and that he could sign. So the credit is widespread, but we should not be assigning credit yet. We are not at the finish line in any of these areas yet. We need to keep pressing so that Congress keeps moving and hopefully produces legislation that the American people will support, that Congress will vote for, and that the President can sign. I want to talk to you about North Korea before I let you go. Has it been the President's intention -- because we have not heard him speak to this issue directly for some weeks -- to not, by staying out of public eye and staying out of this in an audible sense, avoid anything that can be either misinterpreted or just not engaged to suggest to the North Koreans that he is rising to their level? I mean, even analysts who are very accustomed to this cycle of provocation and rhetoric do feel that this looks, sounds, and appears different than other cases. And the average American, they are hearing a lot of things that may unnerve them, and yet they have not heard from the President of the United States. Is he intentionally staying out of this for some strategic communication reason? The President has been directing his national security team to take necessary precautionary measures that will ensure that we can both defend ourself and our allies -- defend ourselves and our allies, defend the homeland. And I think that represents the fact that he is concerned about the stepped-up rhetoric and the provocative behavior by the North Korean regime. It is also the case that what we have seen of late from Pyongyang represents a familiar pattern of behavior. And as you refer to it as cycles, and I think that is an appropriate way to describe it, we have seen this kind of cycle in the past.

I think the President has made clear through the actions of his administration and this government, through the variety of means that have been reported on and the steps that we have taken, the seriousness with which we take this. It is also important to note, as I said, that we have seen a pattern of -- this is reflective of a pattern of behavior that has been going on for quite some time from North Korea. Is this a top issue with Ban Ki-moon later on today? I believe there will be a number of issues discussed with the United Nations Secretary General. This is certainly one of them. It is an issue that the Security Council took up not very long ago, passing a resolution condemning North Korean behavior and sanctioning North Korea that was unanimous, that included affirmative votes from both the Russians and the Chinese. And we are working with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, as well as with Moscow and Beijing to try to bring about a change in behavior from the North Koreans, asking especially the Russians and the Chinese to use the influence they have, the unique influence they have with the North Koreans to prevail upon Pyongyang to ratchet down the rhetoric and the behavior, because it is in the interest of every nation in the region that there be stability in the region, and that there ultimately be a Korean Peninsula that is denuclearized. On another topic, Syria, which obviously is likely to come up -- been a lot of reports the last couple days suggesting that the U.S. is increasing its aid to the rebels. Can you be direct with us about how significant you see this increase in aid? And what does it mean? I appreciate the question. The President himself has said that we are constantly reviewing possible options that could help end the violence and accelerate a political transition in Syria.

So I think that addresses your question.

And we will continue to step up that assistance. The President has directed his team to identify additional measures that we can take to increase that assistance, and we will have a decision to announce in the future. I do not have an announcement to make today. DNI Clapper was on the Hill today, and in some important testimony he said directly that if Assad falls, he said, it is a tough call whether or not the chemical weapons stockpile can be secured. How worried are you about that? It sounds like a pretty dramatic statement from the DNI.

We do have a threshold beyond which we respond to We the People= petitions, and if that threshold is crossed, I am sure we will respond. But I do not have a specific comment on this case. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said of North Korea that it is skating very close to a dangerous line. Does the President share that assessment? And has he identified a red line, a line by which North Korea crossing that would be unacceptable? Well, I will not engage in hypotheticals about what red lines there are. It is unacceptable to flagrantly violate your international commitments, as North Korea continues to do. And the result of that behavior has been increasing international consensus around the proposition that North Korea's flagrant violations of its obligations must stop. That has resulted in increased isolation and sanctions. It has resulted in all the range of actions that we have taken in response to the recent series of provocative acts and statements. There is no question that North Korea -- because of its development of a nuclear weapon, because of its violation of its commitments, its development of missile technology -- represents a danger and a threat. And that is why we address it the way that we do. So I think that the words of Secretary Hagel are reflective of the administration's view of this problem. It is why we have taken the actions that we have taken to ensure that we can enhance both the security of both the homeland and our allies.

And we will continue to work with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon North Korea to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to North Korea. There is an opportunity for North Korea to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for North Korea, and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that North Korea takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with Republicans. The American people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The American people expect their leaders in Washington to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for America's children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future. The President's budget is a common-sense document that represents a sincere attempt to compromise with Republicans on behalf of the whole country. The fact is it is not an la carte menu, as I think Gene Sperling said yesterday in our briefing.

And it allows for the guarantee that those programs represent to our seniors to continue into the future. So the Republicans have to decide -- and there are rank-and-file Republicans who believe this already, but Republicans including leadership has to decide whether they want to find compromise or they would rather stick to positions that are at odds with where most of America is, and are certainly at odds with where the President is. Is the President confident he can get his own party on board with this, given the backlash? Does he need to start having dinner with them? The President is confident that -- as he was during the fiscal cliff negotiations, as he was in previous negotiations with the Speaker of the House -- that Democrats will support a bipartisan compromise that ensures that our assistance programs to our seniors are safeguarded, and that that guarantee is provided; that ensure that investments in education are made, and investments in innovation and research and development and infrastructure are made. The budget represents tough choices, there is no question. But it also expects from the other side that they make tough choices.

I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury. Because Treasury offers and gives licenses for travel, as you know, and the White House has nothing to do with it. So are you saying that he did not -- the President did not have a conversation with Jay-Z? I am absolutely saying that the White House, from the President on down, had nothing to do with anybody's personal -- anybody's travel to Cuba. That is something that Treasury handles. You cannot rhyme that? The President did not communicate with Jay-Z over this trip. ENTITY, do you have something? Let me read this while I have it, which is in answer -- or part answer about our response to the cloture vote. I wanted to let you know that following the Senate's cloture vote, President Obama spoke by phone with family members of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy who are here in Washington, D.C. to ask Congress to pass common-sense measures to reduce gun violence. The President congratulated the families on this important step forward, noting that the bipartisan progress would not have been possible without their efforts. He reiterated that much work remains, and pledged to continue fighting for the votes they deserve. Just to follow up on Syria, al Qaeda in Iraq released on Monday a statement saying they were joining in Syria some opposition groups. And how can you make sure that the money you are going to provide to some opposition groups are not going to end up in those al Qaeda supporters? Well, we work with the Syrian Opposition Coalition, and we obviously are interested in helping and assisting in their consolidation and organization and their overall efforts -- the opposition in Syria that is committed to democratic principles and that is committed to a brighter and more democratic future for Syria. There is no question, and this is a concern around the region, that extremist elements try to take advantage of, in a variety of areas, including Syria, the kind of upheaval that you have seen in a tragedy like Syria. And that is obviously of concern to us, and we monitor it regularly.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney241", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-241", "publication_date": "11-04-2013", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I just have another question related to huge breaking news in France and Europe at this moment. The budget minister of Franois Hollande lied to the people in France about a hidden Swiss account when he was trying to do something about the tax evasion. What is your reaction to that? And what will you say for public officials in terms of probity? Well, I am not aware of that and I will not comment on what seems to be an internal matter in France. So I really do not have a response. I have two questions. One, yesterday, hundreds of minorities from Bangladesh, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, were demonstrating outside the White House. What they were saying, a message for the President that it should read that they are being targeted in Bangladesh because of their race and religion and their beliefs. And whenever there is a problem in Bangladesh and minorities are under attack by the extremists and groups. I do not have a specific response to the demonstration. Obviously, the administration and the President support the civil rights of peoples around the world, but I am just not aware of the specific demonstration or the issues in terms of a presidential response. And as far as guns are concerned, yesterday hundreds of Sikhs were at the Indian Embassy celebrating the Vaisakhi, their national holiday. And talking to them, what they are saying that among them were the families of the victims from Oak Creek, Wisconsin. What they are saying is that guns kill -- it does not matter how many rounds, and it should be banned at all completely, because as long as guns are in the wrong hands of the people, there will be -- people will be killed. And that is the message they were telling me to send to the President and to the Congress. The President's approach is one that embraces common-sense measures to reduce gun violence that do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the American people, Second Amendment rights that the President supports. And you have seen that reflected in the legislation that he supports up on Capitol Hill and in the set of proposals that he made and announced together with the Vice President earlier this year. You were asked last week about the series of leaders coming to visit and talk with the President. Can you talk about the importance the President attaches to having President Morsi here?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney241", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-241", "publication_date": "11-04-2013", "crawling_date": "05-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, I have no announcements to make beyond -- about visits beyond the ones that we already have announced, and which you made note of, and that is that the President will be hosting his counterparts from the UAE, from Qatar, Jordan and Turkey in Washington over the next several weeks. Syria will certainly be one of them. Our relationship with Egypt is and has been very important, and we continue to engage with the Egyptian government. I just do not have any particular next engagement to announce to you at the presidential level. The information also of the $200 million in aid for Jordan that was announced in Amman, can you take that question and get it to us? Well, I have to take it. I am sure the State Department would be a good place to go for more details about it. Back to the budget, if the President's deficit reduction plan is enacted, how many jobs would be lost under his plan as opposed to sequestration? The President's budget will increase job growth in the United States. It includes, in stark contrast to alternatives, investments that will create jobs. It includes tax cuts targeted to small businesses, for example, who hire veterans or small businesses who increase the size of their payroll, for example. It includes investments in infrastructure that will lead to immediate job creation as well as future economic growth and job creation because of the improvements in our roads, bridges, ports, and airports. So the President's -- it is an excellent question because the President's budget proposal, which contains within it his deficit reduction offer to the Speaker, has to be looked at as a whole because it is the President's number-one priority to take measures that help the economy grow, that help it create jobs, that secure and grow the middle class, and reduce our deficit in a responsible way. And the whole point that he was trying to make, and I think he made very well in the Rose Garden, is that you can do that. You can, if you go about it in a responsible way -- and responsible is certainly not what the sequester represents -- but if you go about deficit reduction in a responsible way, you can do it and also invest in our economy in a way that allows it to grow and create jobs.

Today you issued a written statement expressing deep regret for the deaths at No Gun Ri. But the word apologize did not appear in that statement. Is there a reason for that, that you drew a distinction between expressing regret and apologizing? Well, for me, now, other than that I told them to try to draw the statement up based on what we actually knew about the facts. And I worked very closely with or our people have with the Government of South Korea. We want to be responsive to the people there. And I hope the statement will be taken well by the people of South Korea as a genuine expression of regret about what happened. On another issue, there is a story now that a Navy pilot may have been shot down and may be held in Iraq. Do you have any information that leads you to believe that there are Americans held POW in Iraq? Well, I think the most I should say about this now is that in this particular case, and in this case only, I reviewed the evidence that we had, and we concluded that we should take him off the killed-in-action list and put him on the missing list, which means, obviously, that we have some information that leads us to believe that he might be alive. What does the United States do about it? Well, now that we have some information, we will begin well, we have already begun working to try to determine whether, in fact, he is alive; if he is, where he is; and how we can get him out. Because, since he was a uniformed service person, he is clearly entitled to be released, and we are going to do everything we can to get him out. If Iraq was holding an American, they could not use it as an issue with the United States unless they let us know they had somebody. Why would they hold somebody and not let us know about it? Would that be to their advantage? That is why we did what we did on the classification. We have enough information that makes us believe that at least he survived his crash, at least that that is a possibility, and that he might be alive.

Along the same lines, do we now know for certain that Usama bin Ladin was behind the attack on the U.S.S. Cole? I cannot say that. I can we do believe he was behind some other attacks on our people and that people affiliated with him have been involved in other attacks. But we are investigating this. We are still running down some of the leads. We are still doing some of the work. I think that we will know, and I think that the United States will take appropriate action. That is, I have absolutely no doubt that President-elect Bush will continue to pursue the investigation and, when the evidence is in, will take appropriate action. And when that happens, I will support him in doing so. And lastly, on a bit of domestic politics, do you think that Senators would have a good reason not to vote for John Ashcroft for Attorney General because he blocked your nomination of Ronnie White? Well, first, I think that it was a terrible mistake by the Senate to do it, to do it on a strict party-line vote, which required them to get some Republicans to change their position, including the other Senator from Missouri, who had introduced Judge White to the Judiciary Committee, and the Senators on the Judiciary Committee who had voted his nomination out positively to the floor. I am going to follow my policy here. You know, I will be an ex-President when this is done, and I do not believe I should be commenting for some period of time on public affairs, plus which my wife is a Senator. She has to vote on it. So I am going to let she can speak for herself, and the other Democrats and Republicans will speak for themselves. I do not think I should say more. I have known Senator Ashcroft a long time. I know he is genuinely very, very conservative, and that is what is in his heart. But I did not think this was about that, and it surprised and profoundly disappointed me. I thought that with just 9 days left, you might speak out with a little more reckless abandon than usual. Look, I need my Miranda warnings when I talk to you guys, you know.

They did win the popular vote. We were having a good time. Again, let us look back at your 8 years in office, ENTITY. After you were inaugurated in January of 1993, how long do you think it took you to get up to speed as ENTITY? Well, I would say there has there is a different answer to that depending on what the issue the question is. For example, I think that the issues that I talked about today when I reviewed our domestic record on social policy, I think we were ready from day one. I think we were and I think part of that was the fact that I'd been a Governor for a dozen years, that I'd been through a tough economic period, had a clear economic philosophy, had worked on education and welfare reform and crime and the environment. Part of it was the fact that I'd had the opportunity to represent the Governors with the White House and the Congress on many issues. On foreign policy, I think I was up to speed on some things and had to learn a lot on others, and I tried to be a quick study. On the ways of Washington, I think it took us probably, you know, even as much as a year, a year and a half, before we really had a good feel for some of the rather different ways in which the town works and the ways in which what a President does and says communicates itself to the other decisionmakers and to the larger American public in a way that was quite different than had been my experience as Governor.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollercbsradiodovernewhampshire", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller of CBS Radio in Dover, New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-cbs-radio-dover-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "11-01-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We passed the first big first we passed the economic plan, which included, among other things, the empowerment zones and the earnedincome tax credit and all the things that got rid of the deficit, as well. And then we passed the family medical law. We passed the Brady law. We passed the crime bill. We passed NAFTA. You know, we did a phenomenal number of things in those first 2 years, substantively. But because of the whole sort of contentious atmosphere, some of the problems that we had with health care and other issues, I think that it was not as successful politically and I say that in the best sense politically, meaning we did not communicate as well to the American people or the other decisionmakers in Washington in a way that people could see exactly what was happening and that we were underway here. So I think it took me longer to get the politics right. I think it took a little while for me to get entirely comfortable with all the foreign policy and national security issues I had to deal with not too long. And I think we were ready on the substance of domestic policy from day one. As we are about to inaugurate a new President, can the American people believe that its new President will be ready for the job on day one, or do we have to give them a period for on-the-job training? Well, I think he is like any new President. I think he has certain strengths and will be ready in some ways, and I do not think any human being can be ready in every way on day one.

I think on national security, he is got a very, very experienced team, so I think that he will get up to speed there in fairly short order. And on domestic policies, we have different views, and that is where the points of greatest conflict were in the campaign between our two sides. But I think on some things, like education, he is had the opportunity to really work in Texas on, and I think his concern is genuine. And on other things, we will just have to see what happens. I mean, I was a Governor for a dozen years, in good times and bad times. So I think that he will need some time to get kind of just the kind of feel the rhythm of some of these domestic issues, because they were not part of his experience. But I think that the American people should not particularly worry about that because he is got a very experienced team, because he has been a Governor, and because the country is in real good shape right now. And I think he will get right up there to speed on the issues as quickly as possible. I am not too worried about that. As you look back over your years in office, are there things, big things, that you wish you could do over or do differently? If I had it to do again, in the first 2 years I might try to pass welfare reform first, and then do health care. Or I would tell the American people that we had to do the deficit reduction first, and there were only two ways to have universal health coverage. Let me just back up and say, a lot of people believe that if the health care plan had been differently designed or something, it could have passed. The truth is that because of the combined effect of the condition of the economy and the inability to raise taxes, we could have neither an employer mandate or a Government-funded program sufficient to insure 100 percent of health care coverage.

By contrast, if you took polls in the beginning, it would appear that the public overwhelmingly agreed with me on all the gun safety issues, but there is no question that one of the reasons we lost seats in the Congress in '94 was because of the efforts of the NRA.

And the reason for that is but I was not unaware of that; I knew that you have to understand how to read polls. I mean, you could be on a popular issue, but if the people who are against you are more intense than the people who are for you, it will still be a net loss at voting time.

Well, first of all, that is also been in just a good-natured jest. It is true that I am on the way out. I mean, you cannot and so I have had a good time. But actually, you have given me unusually heavy coverage for this late in my term. But that is because we are continuing to do things; we are taking these actions like the environmental actions and the other things. I think, on balance, the coverage has been over an 8-year period, on balance has been intense and fair in the sense that I have always had the chance to put my side out. I think that there are unusual pressures on the media today because there are more competitive outlets, and I think that the net effect of that is that sometimes a herd mentality takes over, and one person gets the story wrong, then everybody gets it wrong. I think that the pressure for market share has aggravated the tendency which already exists, not only in our Capital but in every capital in the world, to elevate politics over policy and discord over working together. So I think that I also think that as the first post-baby-boomer President, and given the fact that I was involved in my youth in the controversies over Vietnam and a lot of other things, I think I became kind of a lightning rod and Hillary did for a lot of things that the system kind of had to work its way through. But I'd be at a poor position to have any profound complaints since I am leaving office with pretty good approval ratings from the American people, and none of that would be possible if it had not been for the media through which I communicated my views and my side of all the controversies.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollercbsradiodovernewhampshire", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller of CBS Radio in Dover, New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-cbs-radio-dover-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "11-01-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

The last point I'd like to make, and I am not pandering to you because you cannot cover me much longer, is but I believe this I think it is a real mistake for people to generalize about the media. Very often there will be a big story in the national news, and ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and CNN will all cover it differently. So I think that you have to I always had the feeling that you were more interested in policy than a lot of the people that covered me, but I think it is more because you have been here so long. I mean, I think you could not have hung around the way you have and done this if you were not fascinated by politics. But in the end, you'd run dry if you did not also care about what the consequences to the country are. And like I said, you cannot cover me much longer, so I am not pandering to you, but I think on the other hand, if you were here now consider, suppose you were a 30-year-old, or however young you can be, 35-year-old television anchor, and you got the White House assignment, and you wanted to go further in life, and you were going to be judged partly by how hot you were on the screen and what your market share was, and you had to put this story together, and you had an hour to do it, you'd be under a whole different set of pressures, both in your work environment and in your head. So I think that I would that is one thing I would counsel any President to do, is not fight paranoia about the press, and do not generalize about it.

In going through this thing, I have now written a mere 31,000 words. Every time you have to make a decision about global economic security during the last 8 years, you make it like that. Mexico, Asia, time and time again, you seem to have a really good sense of what global economic security is about. Well, if you look at it, for one thing, if it is a decision that involves the use of force, almost without exception Haiti being the exception, I guess we have particularly in the Balkans, we thought we had to have first a consensus within NATO and then, if possible, some sanction from the United Nations. It took us a long time to put together that consensus in Bosnia. It took a couple of years. You were saying last time that first, especially Somalia, you had not that you did not have the procedures in place that you later would. I do not feel that way about Bosnia. Bosnia was literally Christopher went to Europe early on. We tried to build a consensus. We finally got the country to, I think, eventually we are proud of what NATO did in Bosnia and proud of the peace process. And ironically, we did not have the kind of delay in Kosovo that I was afraid we'd have. So I think you are going to see this from time to time where, if there is a question on the use of force, whenever possible, the American people will want the United States to act with others. And whenever possible, it would be a good thing if we do and if it is sanctioned by the U.N. or at least if there is a darn good argument that it is covered by a U.N. resolution. And I hope that Somalia will never be used as an excuse for the United States not to be involved in United Nations missions. We are training those soldiers in West Africa now that are going to go into Sierra Leone, which I think is a very good thing. And we have been working, ironically, for several years on the Africa Crisis Response Initiative, trying to generally train soldiers in Africa to be ready to deal with the problems.

It is just that I think, if it happened again, we would have a much clearer notion of the rules of combat. And before we would have an engagement that could literally have led to several hundred casualties on their side and 18 deaths on our side, we would have much greater involvement in the details of it. I talked to McCain about your foreign policy and other things. He was actually very supportive in a lot of other areas, especially high-tech areas. But the argument that he made on foreign policy is one that you hear from the foreign policy priesthood all the time about your foreign policy. They use words like ad hoc and untidy and that you move from issue to issue and there is not the kind of sustained interest in it. He uses an example they use the example of you calling China our strategic partner, and he says Japan's our strategic partner. What do you say to the critics who say that you have not had a sustained and coherent foreign policy? Well, I know they say it, but I disagree. A lot of those people did not want us to be involved in the Balkans. A lot of those people did not think we should have gone into Haiti. I think we have had a consistent policy toward China. We have had to do different things in response to developments there. I think we have had a consistent policy toward Russia, and I think that we have had basically if you go back to some of the foreign policy speeches we gave, I think it is obvious that we have tried to meet the new security threats of the 21st century. We have tried very hard to support a united Europe. We have tried very hard to support the development of democracy in Russia and the reduction of the nuclear threat and removal of nuclear weapons from the other states of the former Soviet Union. We have tried to engage with China. We have tried to contain or reverse the North Korean nuclear threat, and we have supported a dialog between the North and the South.

And I think a lot of the security threats of the 21st century will come not from other nation-states but from the enemies of the nation-states. I think that you will see a convergence of terrorists, narcotraffickers, weapons merchants, and kind of religious and racial nationalists. I think you will see a lot of that. And then I think you will see a convergence of information technology in weaponry which will lead to the miniaturization of seriously dangerous weapons, both conventional and biological and chemical weapons. And I think the likelihood is that sometime in the next 10 years, people will come to think that there will be kind of cross-national threats which will threaten our security as much as one particular other nation. I understand why they are all saying that. But the truth is, a lot of them did not think I was right in Bosnia and Kosovo. They never disagree on the big picture stuff. I talked to Tony Lake, and I read the book that he has coming out in October.

So I believe that. We want to preserve democracy in South America. But you still need to be strong to keep Colombia from collapsing, for example. There needs to be you have to have to have a certain amount of discipline and strength to do what Museveni did in Uganda and reverse the ENTITY rate the infection rate of ENTITY. There has to be a certain amount of strength in the state to rebuild the public health systems which are breaking down all over the world. Laurie Garrett, who wrote The Coming Plague do you remember that book? She is got a new book coming out I have just seen it in galleys about the breakdown of public health systems all over the world, in the states of the former Soviet Union, in developing countries, and speculating what it might mean for us. You have got to have a strong state with some fair measure of strength to deal with the challenges of climate change, for example, a lot of these big questions. So I absolutely agree with that. the continuing agony between India and Pakistan and the centrality of Kashmir to that conflict and that relationship, it would take a pretty strong Government in both countries to really come to grips with the compromises that would be required to make an agreement that would have any shot at all of putting an end to that problem and also putting an end to it as a potential trigger of nuclear exchanges. So, is the story of Camp David II the fact that one country was stronger than the other, and they were not able to make compromise? You do not have to answer it if it is undiplomatic. Well, I think we are using no, because I understand what you mean, but I do not mean it in the same sense you do.

Number one, I think that it is a good thing if the American people, through television or through journalistic writings, have a better, deeper sense of what a person the Presidency, for example not only what we are doing but why we are doing it and how it fits into the larger scheme of things and how it fits into the pattern of our lives.

For one thing, the Democrats do not have anything like the infrastructure or the stomach or the desire to do that that the Republicans do. So there will have to be an actual abuse of power in office in some way that affects the public interest. We do not the guys that make money we have got a lot of rich people to support us. They would not do what Scaife did. They would not waste $7 million going on 15 wild goose chases to try to run somebody down. We are just not that kind of people. We are actually interested in government, and we care more about what we do with power than power. So I think that is part of it. And I think shutting the Independent Counsel law down was part of it. Finally, when it finally was hijacked as basically the private property of the party not in the executive branch, I think its legitimacy was destroyed. So I think, if there ever comes a time again when we really need one, we will get it, the same way we got it back in the seventies. The press and the public will say the only appropriate response is for the Attorney General to name someone or to ask the court to name someone that is clearly independent. Even short of those kind of spectacular, disgraceful, disgusting, awful kind of investigations, the Presidency after you the Presidency exists in people's kitchens. You have been living in our kitchens for the last 8 years. Part of that is television and part of that is my predisposition to work hard in an open fashion.

He would give you a bunch of money for your collaborating on that. Well, I am going to spend a lot of time working on that. My guess is that, just from hearing you talk, that is the kind of stuff that floats your boat these days. Yeah, I want to do stuff that keeps my juices running.

{"id": 3192, "text": "immigration reform and gun control . You said in your speech in Las Vegas the time is now. Gabby Giffords in a very emotional plea in the Senate hearing today on gun control said now is the time. Can Congress tackle both issues at the same time? And which one will have priority? Well, there is no doubt that Congress can tackle both. We have to get comprehensive immigration reform. It is been too long since we reformed the system. And we are starting to see a bipartisan consensus built around this. So we need to take the opportunity and we need to do it fast. As the Senators do their work, start identifying where there is some differences. We can provide some technical assistance. Will one be easier than the other? Well, my suspicion is we are seeing more bipartisan discussion on the immigration issue, than on the gun issue. But I also think that on the gun issue you are starting to see the gun owners, people who traditionally opposed gun control saying you know what, when 20 of our children are shot by somebody whose disturbed, and when it is that easy to get these high clip magazines that can fire off hundreds of shots in a few minutes, that it is time for us to do a better job on background checks. Both will end up generating some opposition and some strong opposition. But I am generally encouraged that the Senate seems to be having a serious conversation about these issues. You said in your speech that if Congress does not work in a timely manner on immigration reform you will send your own bill. And you will ask them to, in your own words, to vote on it right away. What to you is a timely manner? The Senate is supposed to introduce legislation by March. Well, you know if they can get a piece of legislation debated on the floor by March I think that is a good timeline. Keep in mind that most of these issues we have done work on already. We have a pretty good sense of the work we have already done on border security. We already know what would be required to earn a legal status and citizenship in terms of paying a fine and learning English. And going through background checks and paying back taxes. So a lot of this work has been done. So we have already drafted a bill. How much time do you have your own timeline as to how much you would give them, before you intervene with your own bill?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariaelenasalinasunivisionnews", "title": "Interview with Maria Elena Salinas of Univision News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-elena-salinas-univision-news", "publication_date": "30-01-2013", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I am not going to lay down a particular date because I want to give them a little bit of room to debate. Will we have immigration reform by the end of this year? You can tell our audience si se puede! But I want to remind the audience, because Maria Elena we have had this conversation for many, many years. The only way this is going to get done is if the Republicans continue to work with Democrats in Congress in both chambers in order to get a bill to my desk. I was very pleased to see the Senators from both the Democratic side and the Republican side come together and put forth principles. Now they have got to fill in the details. Look, it is not that we do not know how to do this. It is not that we got technical problems. This is a matter of, as I said in my speech yesterday, us recognizing that comprehensive immigration reform will make our economy stronger. It is true to our traditions. It speaks to our future. It makes sure that young people who are here like the DREAMERs who want to contribute and want to join our military, want to start a business, that they have opportunities. And, you know, if we keep that positive mindset understanding that that is a strength of America that we attract talent from all around the world, then I am confident that we can get it done. Most people believe that the biggest hurdle will be the path to citizenship. You have clearly said that it mustn't be included from the outset. Senator Marco Rubio says that he will not support a bill that does not put border security ahead of citizenship. Is this going to end up being a battle between you and Marco Rubio? Look, we put border security ahead of pathway to citizenship. We have done more on border security in the last four years than we have done in the previous 20. We have seen a drop in terms of illegal crossings of about 80 percent since 2000. We have made enormous strides, put resources in, we have actually done almost everything that Republicans asked to be done several years ago as a condition to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform. Given that that is the case, it is not as if we have not been attentive to border security and we will continue to be attentive to border security.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariaelenasalinasunivisionnews", "title": "Interview with Maria Elena Salinas of Univision News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-elena-salinas-univision-news", "publication_date": "30-01-2013", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We want to make sure that we are very clear that this legislation provides a real pathway. Now that pathway will take some time. That even under our proposal, this is not a situation where overnight suddenly people all find themselves as citizens. They are going to have to earn their way to it. And they are going to have to go to the back of the line. We are going to have to clear out the, you know, existing lines, the backlog that we have in terms of legal immigrants. Because they did it the right way. We should not punish them for not breaking the law. So all those things are going to have to be put in place. But we have to put that in the place at the outset and make sure that people are clear that this pathway is real and not just a fantasy for the future. As you could imagine there are hundreds of questions. The questions that I have gotten on social media since I announced that I would be doing this interview. Millions of people are desperate to hear from you. They want answers. People who voted for you and people who are confident that this year, this time around you will definitely keep your promise. But the most commonly asked question is, for example, one from Jonathan made on Facebook. Under your plan what would happen to those who already have deportation letters. Also, would parents of U.S. born children who have been deported be able to come back under your plan? Well, what I am going to do is allow the Senate to work on these details. I do not want to, you know, fill in all the blanks. Because otherwise I would have gone ahead and put a bill forward. And then sometimes that creates a dynamic in Congress where if I am for it, then maybe some people have to be against it. I think that over the next several weeks, these next several months what we will see is many of these issues will be debated. But the basic principle would be, from my perspective, that somebody who has lived here has been overall a good neighbor has been somebody who is been law abiding other than the fact that they came here illegally. That have put roots down here. That they should have the capacity to earn citizenship.

And as I said, we have got to make sure that we streamline the process for legal immigration because so much of the illegal immigration process has resulted because it is so difficult for many people to reunify with their families, and so forth. Now I know that you have reduced, this is another concern on Twitter, the number of deportations of non-criminals. However, in 2012 more than 184,000 non-criminals were deported. In the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? This is not about policy. It is about people. Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I am not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I am required to follow the law. And that is what we have done. But what I have also said is, let us make sure that we are applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That is the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example. So we are making some changes there. With respect to deportations until we get comprehensive immigration reform. That is one of the reasons I think it is so important for us to go ahead and get this action done. And keep in mind that if we are able to say, at the end of this year, or maybe even before the end of the summer, that we have gotten comprehensive immigration reform done, then that then empowers me to deal with many of these issues in a way that I think, to allow the more specific issues that a lot of people I think would like to see resolved. If you had to choose, what would be the concessions that you would be willing to make on immigration reform? And what would be completely unacceptable to you? I think comprehensive immigration reform has to continue and build on the work we have done to strengthen border security. It has to have provisions to strengthen the legal immigration system.

One of my highest priorities as an administration, particularly in my second term, because now I am thinking about legacy, is to make sure that we are identifying talent from every walk of life, from every ethnic group, so that the next President will see how big a pool there is of talent out there, that can serve and wants to serve in a Presidential administration. So we are going to redouble our efforts to recruit talented and gifted Latinos that come from every walk of life. It comes from academia, it comes from elected officials. It comes from foundations and non-for profits. Maybe some will come from the media. And we want to identify as much talent as possible. And you know, obviously the Latino community is growing faster than just about any other community. And that means that we have got to prepare leadership for the future, not just for today.

We have a different kind of crisis, a world crisis instead of a domestic crisis, eight years later. In some ways, on a comparable basis for the future of the country, it is probably more serious than the one eight years ago. I think we might let it go at that. President, do you see any cause for concern in the labor situation as affecting the defense projects? Of course that is a question that would take half an hour to answer the kind of question that cannot be answered. It is a little like saying, Have you stopped beating your wife? I got a letter oh, yesterday or the day before from a very worthy citizen in Florida who was frightfully upset because of what he had read. Where he had read it, I am not saying; but anyway it was because of what he had read. We are all horrified by the complete breakdown of defense production because of strikes. In other words, he got it into his head that there was a breakdown in production because of strikes. Now, of course there are a certain number of strikes; and I would hate to give you this as the definitive figure, but I think it is approximately correct that about a quarter of one percent of production has been affected by strikes at any given time A quarter of one percent is what?- one four-hundredth; so you see the gentleman had got an erroneous impression from what he had read, according to his own statement. In other words, somebody had written something I am not saying where that had caused a perfectly worthy citizen to get a false impression, and that is a great pity for our defense effort President, do you think it is justified for the labor unions to charge fees on construction projects on all men, whether or not they are members of unions, for a job?

Were you surprised by the warmth? Well, I was surprised by the size and intensity of the crowd. I knew that the Romanian people my friend Mr. Moses here keeps me updated, and I knew that they were very friendly toward America. And keep in mind, they really did suffer more in the recent past than any other people under any of the other Communist governments I mean, what they went through here to gain their liberty.

On the one hand, our country helped defeat fascism, and upon the defeat of fascism, they saw their homelands be taken over by a repressive ideology.

So my strong advice right now to Congress is, if they are seriously concerned about immigration, about our borders, about being able to keep criminals out of this country, then what they should be doing is working together and working with this administration for a comprehensive immigration policy that allows us to continue to be both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And certainly they need to start funding the Department of Homeland Security so that they can go forward with all the functions that Republicans say they want carried out, including strong border security functions. But with respect to the ruling, we-I disagree with it. I think the law is on our side and history is on our side. And we are going to appeal it. For those who are now wondering whether or not they should apply, we are going to refer those questions to the Department of Homeland Security that is already begun the planning process. And we will be prepared to implement this fully as soon as the legal issues get resolved. Why not wait until the higher court rules on your programs before implementing them? Well, keep in mind, we are not going to disregard this Federal court ruling. The law is the law in this country, and we take things a step at a time. So we are not going to be actually taking applications in until this case is settled. But we are doing the preparatory work because this is a big piece of business and it is important for us to do in order for us to actually secure our borders effectively and allocate limited resources to the most important tasks and functions that the Department of Homeland Security has. We should not be tearing some mom away from her child when the child has been born here and that mom has been living here for the last 10 years, minding her own business and being a important part of the community.

If I were a Republican President and I had followed policies which reduced the deficit, shrunk the Federal Government to its smallest size since President Kennedy was in office, increased the economic prosperity of the country, reduced the nuclear threat, expanded trade, and passed the toughest crime bill in a generation, they would be running me for sainthood.

And my job is simply to get out and give them the facts, and then they will make the decision. President Clinton, we want to go to the viewers now. As you can imagine, we asked them to give us questions for you; we were having a chance to talk to the President. The first question is from Andrea Wilson of Norwalk. Andrea wants to know, ENTITY, what you are going to do to make deadbeat moms and dads accountable and responsible for supporting their children. I sent in the springtime a welfare reform bill to Congress which, among other things, has a much tougher mechanism of child support enforcement. I think we have to have more automatic requirements, more wage withholding, more respect for these child support orders across State lines. It has simply got to be easy to get the child support payments out there. We have got billions and billions of dollars of unpaid child support. And if we had it paid by people who can afford to pay it, the welfare problem would be much smaller, and it would be a lot easier for people who are struggling to raise their children in dignity, to do it. It comes from a woman named Eva Nay, who wants to know why, if you made jobs one of your administration's top priorities, there are still layoffs and little in the way of job creation in Connecticut? I have got some figures right here; I will check it. The national economy, since I became President, has produced 4.6 million new jobs. Now, the Government did not do all that; most of these jobs are in the private sector. But we created the environment in which the jobs could be created by bringing the deficit down, by expanding trade, by investing more in new technologies. Not every American who wants a job has one, and of course, there is nothing the National Government can do to stop some companies from laying off. What our job is is to create more jobs than are lost, and we are doing that.

Well, I think there are always things that you will think you did wrong. But I think, basically, we have continued on the path that we set in 1981. The progress that we have made economically is apparent. It is the first time in many years that we have had a recovery from a recession in which not only is industrial well, let us say just productivity increasing, personal earnings increasing, inflation and unemployment both going down all of these things happening at the same time. This has not happened in a recovery for many, many years, which makes me believe we are on a firm footing and have laid a foundation for a solid recovery. There are things if you say what should we have done differently? In trying to negotiate bipartisan agreements on some of these, you look back and think, well, maybe if we'd worked harder in one direction or another we might have gotten more cooperation in our need to reduce government spending. On the international scene, I think that our continued buildup of our strength has changed international relations a great deal. I do not think without that we would have had the beginning negotiations that we have had with regard to reduction of nuclear weapons, both the INF and the START talks. I think it is due to that. I think we have got a finer relationship than we have had for a long time with our own friends and allies. This is particularly true in the efforts that we have made in Asia, as well as our longtime friends in Europe. But it is a foundation laid for more progress. If I could just but surely was there anything you went back at the end of the day and said, Oh, darn, I really you know that did not work right, we should have done it. Is there any one thing that you can pick out? Oh, well, I probably could get incensed about but this was before 1983, earlier than that going for the tax bill on the assumption that we'd been promised about $3 in reductions in spending for every dollar of tax revenue, and we have never seen the $3 in reduced spending.

We are hopeful that the peace process will bring about more Arab nations making their peace with Israel. Obviously, a part of that process depends on a fair and just settlement of the Palestinian question. And Arafat has, in the past, has been one who has refused to recognize Israel's right to exist as a nation. But the fact that earlier, and before this split in the PLO ranks, he had begun to discuss with King Hussein negotiations and participating in those negotiations on behalf of the Palestinians-then that broke down with the split in the Palestinian movement. Now I think that what President Mubarak is doing is talking to him about returning to where he was earlier, making contact with King Hussein, and getting those peace negotiations, our peace proposal, underway again. I really do, because we had believed that a settlement in Lebanon had to precede going further with that. I think enough progress has been made there that we can go forward with the peace movement. Israel has denounced the talks between Arafat and President Mubarak, saying it was a pure violation of the Camp David agreements. Would you respond to that? I can understand their feelings in view of the recent tragedy in Jerusalem, and the group taking credit for that claimed to be a PLO group and all. But at the same time, I think as they look at this a little more clearly, they will see that Mubarak, based on the experience of Egypt and its willingness to go forward for peace, is simply trying to persuade others to change their thinking. There was one point not too long before the peace treaty with Egypt, in which Egypt was as violent in its hostility as perhaps today the elements of the PLO are. So, who is better able to try and bring in another person into the peace process than someone who has made the change that Egypt has made? Do you think Mr. Arafat is still a popular leader among the Palestinians themselves? Well, this is what we need to find out.

And what do you see as the chance of an arms accord in 1984? Well, we are going to keep on with that. They said they would not set a date yet for the resumption of these talks. On INF they just walked out. On the INF talks they just walked out. Yes, but since then there have been statements to the fact that they just are not ready and that they are unwilling at this point to set a date. I believe they will be back, and I believe we are further from a confrontation possibility because of the deterrent capability of the United States and our allies at this point. I think there was a far more unstable condition when we had let our own strength deteriorate to the point that there was a window of vulnerability. And I would like to call your attention to one thing. The SALT talks, actually, were not arms reductions; they were supposed to be setting a ceiling on how many more weapons would be built. But in these negotiations, even though the Soviets were not as forthcoming as we would like to have had them be, they still did make a couple of offers to reduce the number of their weapons. Now, that is the first time they have ever done that in any negotiations, in all these previous 19 attempts. And I think that now that they see that we are determined to maintain our own ability to defend ourselves, and our allies with us are included in that, I think that they have to see that these negotiations are in their interest as well as ours. Do you have any signals that they are actually planning to come back? Or are you just looking at it from your what you see as common sense? I think the things that we have heard. I think that this is, you might say, almost a part of the negotiating process. Their whole principal move over this last year or so has been an effort to stop the deployment of the intermediate-range weapons that were asked for by NATO.

But, sir, you only have 3 really, 3 minutes now to make a decision on war and peace according to the nuclear scientists.

How do you see the prospects for some kind of an agreement before the elections? Well, I would hope that the Soviet Union would remember their failure in trying to influence the German election and decide not to go down that road again.

We are not, as we have been portrayed, that the two superpowers are here separated with no contact at all. No, we are in communication with them.

I am prepared to say if the Soviet Government wants peace, there will be no war, because I know for a fact that no other country wants war with the Soviet Union. The ball is really in their court. If they want peace, they can have it. I think the deterrent capability, yes. See, we have a weapon here in the world today, the nuclear weapon, that for the first time in the history of all man's weapons has never resulted in a defensive weapon being created against it. The only thing we have is the knowledge that on both sides the punishment would be more than any nation could afford. If they started it, they would have to be prepared to accept virtually as much punishment as they were administering. And this has kept the peace. I have had some meetings with young people who brought this very subject up, and they are greatly concerned. And I have asked them a question, and I must say they come up with a pretty sound answer. I have said, We are the only ones that have ever used a nuclear weapon in Japan in World War II. Would we have used that weapon if we knew they also had that weapon and could use it back against us? And without fail, every group I have ever said this to has decided that, no, we would never have used the weapon. So, that is the real deterrent to war.

But, no, there was a reaffirmation by us of what our relationship with Israel has been since 1948.

But he did have a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General on Monday, where they had come to him to express their concerns. The President asked they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received. So it is the White House's assertion that Rod Rosenstein decided on his own, after being confirmed, to review Comey's performance? And I think most of America had decided on their own that Director Comey was not the person that should be leading the FBI, as evidenced by the numerous comments that we have seen from Democrat members in the House and Senate, Republican members, members of the FBI, and people across the board. Since we are establishing the facts -- Senator Dianne Feinstein said she was told something different directly from the President. The President said he asked Rosenstein and Sessions to review this. He asked them for their recommendation, based on the conversation that they had on Monday. He asked them to put that recommendation in writing. But they came to him on his own. And again, the President had lost confidence in Comey from the day he was elected. On May 3rd, Sean came out and said that the President had full confidence in his FBI Director? Why did he say that?

Until you said from the podium just now that the President lost confidence in him over the last weeks and months, we had thought that this was all Rosenstein's doing. When was it that the President lost confidence in James Comey? I think it is been an erosion of confidence. I think that Director Comey has shown over the last several months and, frankly, the last year, a lot of missteps and mistakes. And certainly I think that, as you have seen from many of the comments from Democrat members, including Senator Schumer, they did not think he should be there, they thought he should be gone. Frankly, I think it is startling that Democrats are not celebrating this since they have been calling for it for so long. Do not forget, and I have another one I need to ask you, too. To follow on that, you said that he made a lot of missteps and mistakes. Back at the end of October, this President was applauding the FBI Director when he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. So he seemed quite happy with him at that point. Well, I think the President's position. One he was a candidate for President, not the President. Once you take over leading the Department of Justice that is very different than being a candidate in a campaign. As you guys all know, there is a very clear distinction between those two things. I think also having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic just atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in the Department of Justice. Any person of legal mind in authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in the Department of Justice, particularly for somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, who has been part of the Justice Department for 30 years and is such a respected person -- when he saw that, he had to speak up on that action, and I think that was the final catalyst. The President is accused by Democrats of trying to circumvent the Russia investigation by firing Comey; he meets with the Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador to the United States.

I'd have to refer you to -- And does the White House believe that if these FBI investigations are going to proceed in these allegations of Russian interference, do you support continued funding, and support who to lead that investigation? Who is going to be running that right now? Right now I believe that would fall to the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.

And another reason, frankly, for Director Comey to be out of the way so that they can have somebody leading this effort that everybody across the board has respect and confidence in. Nobody wants this to be finished and completed more than us so that we can focus on what we need to do here. ENTITY, the President said -- or excuse me -- Sean Spicer said just a week ago today the President has confidence in the Director. So, again, I am sorry for not understanding this, but what has happened in the last seven days to shake the confidence? Was Sean lying at that point? Or did something happen in the last seven days? Of course, you'd love to add that in. Again, I think one of the big things that took place was the process in the hearing on Wednesday where, again -- not to sound like a broken record, but since you guys keep asking the same questions, I guess it is only fair that I keep giving the same answers -- but you have somebody, the Director of the FBI, who reports to the Deputy Attorney General, going around the chain of command. That is not something that is allowed in the justice system, nor should it be. That, along with the corrections that had to take place over the last, I believe, 48 hours, those are all big problems and another, I think, kind of final piece that pushed the President to make the decision that he did. Does he regret not doing it earlier, like on January 20th or January 21st? No, I believe the President wanted to give Director Comey a chance, but he feels that he made the right decision, certainly. Why did he do as he did it, if I could ask? Why did he have one of his long-time security advisors hand-deliver a letter to the FBI when the FBI Director was, in fact, in Los Angeles? Did not he deserve a phone call or a face-to-face conversation? Why did he decide to do it like that? He followed the proper protocol in that process, which is a handwritten notification. And at the same time, no matter how you fire someone, it is never an easy process, and so he felt like following protocol was the best thing to do. Does he plan to speak to him? I am not aware of that conversation.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingprincipaldeputypresssecretarysarahsanders", "title": "Donald J.

Not that I am aware of, and I think that would be a better question for the Department of Justice. Can I ask a follow-up? On the campaign trail, President Trump frequently said lock her up, and he criticized the Department of Justice for not being harsh enough on Hillary Clinton. He actually praised Director Comey in October for having the guts to reopen the investigation. Why was he moved by a letter that said that Director Comey was, if anything, too harsh on Hillary Clinton? Why does that move the President to fire him? Again, I think you are looking at two very different positions. The President was wearing a different hat at that time. And again, when you go around the chain of command in the Department of Justice, when you, like I said before, throw a stick of dynamite into the Department of Justice, that is a big problem and it is one that cannot be ignored. But he already knew that, did not he, ENTITY? He already knew what Mr. Comey had done. I think that this was -- my understanding is Wednesday was the first time the Director had openly and publicly made that statement and made that clear. The statement today on the President's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov did not include anything on the reported incidents of violence in Chechnya against people in the LGBT community. Is the reason why that was not included in the readout is because the President is not informed on the issue? Is the reason why that was not included in the readout is because the President is not informed about the reports of anti-gay violence in Chechnya? Look, I mean a lot of times there are parts of the conversation that are not specifically included in a readout. But I am not aware -- I have not had that conversation, so I do not know. I was not part of that meeting, so I cannot speak to every detail. And I'd have to refer you to the readout on the specifics of what I know was discussed.

You have got a House committee, a Senate committee, and the Department of Justice all working on this. I do not think that there is a necessary need at this point to add that. You have got the Deputy Attorney General, who I would say is about as independent as it comes due to the fact that he has such bipartisan support. What gives you such confidence that the rank and file within the Bureau lost faith in the FBI Director? The vast majority of the Bureau is in favor of Director Comey. The real losers here are 20,000 front-line people in the organization because they lost the only guy working here in the past 15 years who actually cared about them. So what is your response to these rank-and-file FBI agents who disagree with your contention that they lost faith in Director Comey? Look, we have heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with Acting Director McCabe later today to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the FBI -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI if he feels that that is necessary and appropriate. And we will certainly provide further information on that meeting for you guys. The organization that represents FBI agents is asking for a voice in the selection process of Mr. Comey's successor. I have not had that conversation, but I know, at this point, it is being run through the Department of Justice. And so I would refer you to them on what that process looks like at this point in time. Who did the President consult before making the final decision to fire James Comey? The President spoke with a number of individuals, but at the end of the day, it was the President's decision. And in between Monday night and Tuesday, when he decided to fire the FBI Director, did he speak again with the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General? I know that they spoke on Monday, and I believe the next follow-up was actually in writing. Just to be clear, so is it accurate to pull away from the information that we have that Monday night the President made the final call, said I want this in writing as a recommendation, and then took that recommendation as the evidence that he wanted to provide to fire James Comey?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingprincipaldeputypresssecretarysarahsanders", "title": "Donald J.

You say you want to move on and focus on the thing that Americans care about. So let me ask you about that. You are somewhat halfway home on healthcare. You still have tax reform to do, a spending bill, debt ceiling, and infrastructure. But what happened yesterday, you could argue, just widened the divide and made D.C. politics more toxic. So how do you go about accomplishing all of those things with, now, the heightened political environment that we are in? Frankly, I am surprised that it did create a divide since you have had so many Republicans and Democrats repeatedly calling for Director Comey to be gone. Frankly, I do not think it matters what this President says, you are going to have Democrats come out and fight him every single step of the way. I think that is one of the things that is wrong with Washington, and I think that is one of the reasons that we have got to get back to focusing on those issues and, frankly, draining the swamp a little bit further. Was he surprised by the Democratic backlash? Did he anticipate it, considering some of the past statements? How could he have, considering the fact that most of the people that are declaring war today were the very ones that were begging for Director Comey to be fired? If Hillary Clinton had won the election -- which, thank God, she did not -- but if she had, and she had been in the same position, she would have fired Comey immediately, and the very Democrats that are criticizing the President today would be dancing in the streets celebrating. So it is just the -- I think, the purest form of hypocrisy. One, there is a report in Israel that indicates the President has made a decision not to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Can you confirm that? Has he made a decision on that? The President has not made a decision yet, and is still reviewing that. Also, President Erdogan, in his speech, I think, this morning, warned the President against moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Does that warning and warning from other Arab leaders play into his decision as he is considering this move?

Two questions, both related to the selection of a successor to Director Comey. When President Carter chose a FBI director, he had a blue ribbon panel advising him. Presidents Clinton and Obama interviewed several candidates. Is the President going to follow this pattern, or does he have some individual in mind at this point? Right now, I know that there are several individuals being considered, and the first step will be determining the acting -- or, excuse me, the interim director. And that is being handled through the Department of Justice, and I would refer you to them for right now. Oh, yeah, I forgot you have got two. I have got two. He does not get a question anymore. Who is had a birthday. Just want to make sure we got that in again. I was going to say it is a fact that the Association of Former FBI Agents and Veterans of the Bureau generally prefer people who have been agents themselves or have a background in the FBI. Only two former agents have been director in the last four decades. Will the President consider current or former agents for the position? I would say that he is not ruling anything out at this point. But again, as of today, the Department of Justice is handling the first step in this process. Should the Attorney General, who has recused himself from the Russia investigation, have any role in the selection of a successor? And given the fact that in his 100-day interviews, the President himself said he had confidence in Director Comey, at this podium the American people were told he had confidence in Director Comey, can people take at face value what the President says about personnel issues like this, or his views on things, if just two weeks later, he is out? Absolutely, you can take full confidence in the words of the President. In terms of whether or not Attorney General Sessions should have a role -- look, the FBI is doing a whole lot more than the Russia investigation. I know everybody in this room and probably most of the media around the world would like to think that is the FBI's sole responsibility, but that is probably one of the smallest things that they have got going on their plate, and the 20,000 employees that work there.

Is it appropriate for the White House to be directing the FBI what to do with any investigation they are currently investigating? I do not think that that was the nature or the intent of my comment, was not to direct the FBI, but I think it is simply -- we are fully compliant with helping this process move along. We'd like to see it completed so that, frankly, all of us can move on and focus on things that Blake listed earlier, like tax reform, like healthcare, like infrastructure. Those are big programs, big priorities for this administration. And, frankly, what we'd like to be the number-one thing that we are talking about here, today, every single day, is not FBI investigations but things that, frankly, affect American voters and American taxpayers every single day. What exactly precipitated the Monday meeting? Was that because of the hearing last week and what he said there? Or did the Monday meeting that the President had with the DOJ officials come out of a longer process of consideration of Comey? The Department of Justice officials were here for other business, not specifically to meet with the President on that. The topic came up, and they asked to speak with the President, and that is how it moved forward. Did the President previously talk to Attorney General Sessions or Deputy Attorney Rosenstein about the possibility of going this way with Comey? Not that I am aware of, no. Did it come up in the discussion process before the confirmation that the President was considering nominating Rosenstein -- did he talk about Comey with Rosenstein then? No, not that I am aware of. The President's statement that he talked to Comey about whether or not he was being investigated raises several questions. Can you talk about why you are not willing to add any more to that about who asked for that and why that was discussed? Who asked for what? About whether or not -- I mean, the President seems to be trying to exonerate himself in this.

The other thing I underestimated was the extreme partisanship of the Republican congressional leadership which we now know from studies is the worst it is been since World War II. No ENTITY ever had to deal with that. Now, notwithstanding that, after the Congress went home, we learned that this was only the third time since World War II when the Congress supported the President more than 80 percent of the time. And so we were able to have a historic reduction in the deficit and to provide a dramatic increase in college loans for middle class people and pass the family leave law and the Brady bill and a dramatic crime bill and immunize the kids in the country who are under 2 by 1996.

Then it became clear he did not disarm and did not disclose, and so we had a debate about the definition of serious consequences. My attitude is, when you say something, you better do it.

They value politicians who stick to principles rather than those who compromise. And you will not be surprised to hear that that is what I hear often from my radio listeners. If control of the House changes, as now appears likely, and it is brought about by voters who want to put the brakes on you, how are you going to govern for the next two years? Well, first of all, you know, I think the only poll that matters is going to be on November 2nd. And I still feel confident that it is a very close race in terms of the House. You have got close races all across the country, including in your hometown. And a lot of it is going to depend on turnout. Having said that, there is no doubt that voters across the board, I think, want to see Washington work. They do not want games. They do not want posturing. They do not want business as usual. They want us to focus on them, on jobs, on the economy, on keeping small businesses open. And my expectation is, is that Republicans, should they win additional seats, should they be in a position to hopefully take more responsibility working with us, are going to say to themselves that it is important for us to show some accomplishments over the next couple of years. And I think there is some areas where traditionally we have had bipartisan agreement. I will give you an example -- infrastructure. We should have the best infrastructure in the world. We used to have the best roads, the best airports, the best rail systems. We do not anymore, and it is important for us to, I think, put people back to work right now doing the work that America needs done. And that is the kind of thing that I think we could get bipartisan support. The same is true on potentially reducing our debt and our deficit. Everybody agrees that we have to get control of our deficits. I think us working together, Democrats and Republicans, with a responsible plan that makes sure that we are protecting those core investments like education, that help improve economic growth long term, but also eliminating wasteful spending, is something where we should be able to get some agreement.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmichaelsmerconishmsnbc", "title": "Interview With Michael Smerconish on MSNBC", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-michael-smerconish-msnbc", "publication_date": "27-10-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And you know, Keynes was THE proponent of deficit spending by government to avoid recession. And what occurs to me, sir, is that while your approach has been an $800 billion stimulus, over there they are raiding the retirement age, they are making 130 billion in spending cuts, and they are eliminating a half million jobs. Which begs this question, why is not that the right approach for us? Well, keep in mind, first of all, that they had a big stimulus program over the course of the last two years. So actually, Britain has taken the same approach that we have, and most countries have taken the same approach, which is that in crisis when you had a complete collapse of the economy and jobs were being shed at a pace of hundreds of thousands a month, that it was very important to make sure that the government was able to provide a backstop and allow businesses to heal and recover. Now, we have done that over the last two years. The question is, what do we do going forward? And our problem has not been as bad as Britain's in terms of debt relative to GDP. Our problem is a long- term structural problem that has to do with the fact that we have got an aging population, we have got a bunch of entitlements that are very expensive and are very popular. People like Social Security, they like Medicare. I think that those are pillars of security for people in the retirement age. And so we have to make sure that those are there for future generations, but we have got to make sure that we make some adjustments so that those programs are in place. And I think that we can responsibly set a pathway where, over the course of several years, we are reducing our deficit without endangering economic growth, without endangering, you know, the core investments that are required to make sure that the American dream continues, and without completely shredding our safety net. In a word, what I hear from listeners on a day- to-day basis is, angst. And you talk about the American dream.

{"id": 3294, "text": "What I hear from people is a concern that that is no longer the case. They are fearful that their own children will continue to exceed their own opportunities. Well, look, we have gone through a tough decade. I mean, obviously, we have been focusing mostly on this brutal recession that we have gone through, the worst since the Great Depression. But between 2001 and 2009, middle-class families saw their income go down by 5 percent. During that period, job growth was more sluggish than anytime since World War II. So middle-class families have every right to be frustrated and concerned. And the answer is going to be making sure that we are doing what we have always done best, which is innovate, have a dynamic private sector that is investing in new plants and new equipment and hiring new workers. We have got to have a government that is lean and mean, but also making important investments that foster long-term growth. I already mentioned infrastructure. Making sure that we have got the best education system in the world. We used to be ranked number one in the proportion of college graduates. We now rank 21st and 25th, respectively, in our math and science education. And we have begun addressing them over the last two years. So for example, we took away tens of billions of dollars that were going in the form of unwarranted subsidies to banks, and we have made sure that that money was going into making student loan programs cheaper so that more people have access to college educations. That is going to be critical for our long-term growth. I will say, this is an example of the choice that we confront in this election, because my colleagues on the Republican side right now have said that they want tax cuts for the top 2 percent, the wealthiest Americans. And that would cost $700 billion, and they have no way of paying for it. But part of the way that they are suggesting to pay for it is to potentially cut education by 20 percent. That is not a smart way for us to get our debt and deficits under control. We do not want to undermine those things that help us grow over the long term. But I guess that is the reason why I brought up the British model or the British example, is because what I hear from folks on a day-to-day basis is they want to see some corresponding reduction of federal spending.

So we each year have identified billions of dollars in cuts and wasteful spending. And you know, as I said before, part of what we have to recognize is that over the last two years we had a brutal recession and a critical crisis that had to be addressed. And that did increase the deficit. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that we would have seen hundreds of thousands of teachers laid off, hundreds of thousands of firefighters and police officers laid off. This is not just at the federal level. It is also at the state level. We had to help them because their budgets were getting decimated by the severity of this recession. But having said that that, you know, that was a crisis moment that had to be addressed, what people are actually right about is that we have got to make sure that, moving forward, we are doing so in a responsible way. And the best way for us to do it is to do it with a scalpel, not a machete, and to make sure that the cuts we are making are not eliminating those things that are going to help us grow. One percentage point of additional economic growth next year or the year after actually would do more to close the deficit than anything else that we could do, because it brings in more revenues. So you know, if we could make sure that we are eliminating wasteful programs while at the same time growing the economy, that should be the sweet spot that we are aiming for. ENTITY, why is no one who supported the health-care bill running on it ? Well, I think that you have seen a couple hundred million dollars' worth of negative TV ads that make it very difficult to do so.

It is good for the American agricultural worker. When I go to the peace conference in Madrid, I happen to think that it is in the national interest to try to help bring peace to that troubled corner of the world. When we stand up against Saddam Hussein's aggression and beat back that, I think it is in the American interest. When I go to the Soviet Union and work with Yeltsin and Gorbachev in turning over that whole system, helping them now move down democracy's road, that is in our pure economic interest. And when I am going to go to Japan, it will be in the same thing. We have got to open up those markets.

And I talked to Bob Dole, Bob Michel, thanked them; thanked Speaker Foley, the leader of the Democrats in the House; Chairman Rostenkowski, the Democratic leader of the Ways and Means because we have come to agreement now in a way that operates within the budget agreement and, thus, will not raise people's taxes. My argument with the unemployment bill that was passed before is they just wanted to bust the budget agreement, just added to the burden for the 94 percent of the people who are working. And so we finally prevailed on this, provided the Senate votes for it.

We are spending far more per victim on ENTITY research than we are on heart disease or cancer, which are far greater killers. We have got to do more in the education front on ENTITY. When I talked to the researchers at National Institutes of Health, I think they feel that they could use more money, but I do not think they feel a shortage of research funds is what is important. We are trying to speed ENTITY research drugs to market even though some are going to accuse us of getting them there before they have been fully tested. I think maybe we need to do more in terms of education.

You may have seen a Conrad cartoon; it showed you in caricature, and the caption was Or maybe you'd like Bush back and another $2 trillion debt. How could we avoid that and make the whole economic climate healthier? Well, the first thing we have to do is to gain control over our economic destiny again. The deficit is spinning out of control. It was about $74 billion a year in 1980; it is over $300 billion this year. The debt, as you know, has gone from $1 trillion to $4 trillion. And because of that, the money we ought to be investing has not been there. You can see that very clearly in Los Angeles and southern California when you had all these defense cutbacks. We should have been reinvesting all that money in domestic technologies to put the people back to work here at home in high-speed rail, environmental cleanup, all kinds of other things. But the debt was so big that the money went to pay interest on the debt and into exploding health care costs. So our economic plan is terribly important to the people of the United States and the people of southern California because it begins to give us some control back. Already, the fact that the plan is making progress has brought down long-term interest rates. I know one lady who called you said her husband was in construction. Because we are at 20-year mortgage rates lows, there have been 130,000 new jobs come into this economy in construction in the last 4 months. That is the biggest increase in 9 years. Now, it is going to take a while to reach southern California, because that is one of the most distressed areas of our national economy. So you have got to bring the deficit down. You have got to do it in a way that is fair to the middle class, by making upper income people pay the lion's share of the burden. Over the next 5 years, we still need to spend some money to try to redevelop the businesses, the communities, and retrain the workers that have been hurt so badly by defense cutbacks. So this is a good plan, and it is still the only real plan on the table.

But we can turn it around if we will do so with discipline and if we will stop the delay, if we will go forward now and pass the plan. ENTITY, you mentioned critics. Congressman Henry Hyde, speaking for the Republicans, claimed over the weekend that the Senate Democrats are going to agree to a tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend program this summer that will result in another version of the biggest tax hike in history. In a nutshell, by year's end, will the rich be taxed considerably more, heavily taxed? By year's end, if the plan passes, upper income taxes will go up, taxes on the upper 6 percent of the American people; two-thirds of the tax burden would be paid for by people with incomes above $200,000. The tax on the middle class, in the form of an energy tax, would be phased in over a 3-year period and would amount to no more than $17 a month for a family of four with an income of $50,000 to $60,000, by the third year of the plan. By contrast, families with incomes of under $30,000 would be held harmless, and there would be an incentive in this tax program, for the first time, for people who work 40 hours a week but have children in the home and are still in poverty. The tax system would actually lift them out of poverty. But the most important thing from my point of view is that there cannot be taxes without an equal amount of spending cuts. People who say there are not spending cuts just have not said it right. And for Mr. Hyde, whom I like a lot, to just get on there and chant their old tax-and-spend line, I mean, you know, that is the same crowd that presided over the last 12 years where we went from a $1 trillion to a $4 trillion debt, increased the national deficit every year, and reduced our investment in the future.

We are either going to have to make up our mind whether to do the tough stuff necessary in terms of budget cuts and fair revenue increases to bring this deficit down and get control of our economic future and keep these interest rates down, or we are not. And let me just make one other point. For anybody who has refinanced a home loan or refinanced a business loan or gotten a car loan, a consumer loan, a college loan at lower interest rates, a lot of people are going to in the middle class and even some upper income people are going to save more money on lower interest rates than they are going to pay in higher taxes. We have got to start investment in this economy again. And if we do not , we are going to be in real trouble. You had someone call from Orange County; I see what is happened to real estate in Orange County. our proposal contains significant incentives to get the real estate business in California up and going again and throughout the country. There are all kinds of things in this plan which are very, very good for business, that the business community has been asking for for years. But we do ask people who are earning income, who have it and whose taxes went down in the eighties while the deficit went through the roof, to pay a fairer share of the tax burden so we can bring the deficit down. Does Ross Perot concern you? And I pose it that way because of his stand on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. He really is claiming that this country and particularly this State of California is going to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs that would go to Mexico if the agreement should be ratified. Well, I disagree with him on that issue. There are other issues on which I think we are agreed. We have got a version of the line-item veto in the United States Senate. I very much hope it will pass; I strongly support that. I am pushing for campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of special interests in campaigns, something that he and I both talked about in the last campaign. We have got that out of the Senate; we need to pass it in the House. We are pushing for lobbying reform, something we both talked about last time.

{"id": 3304, "text": "But on NAFTA we just disagree. I believe that a country like ours, if we want to generate more jobs, we are going to have to increase the volume of trade. Number one, something you know perhaps better than other Americans, anyone who wants to shut a plant down and go to Mexico today for low wages can do it. And they will be able to do it just as well today or tomorrow as they could after NAFTA is ratified. Number two, as you have seen in California, as long as incomes are very depressed in Mexico, you are going to have a bigger and bigger problem with immigration that goes beyond the legal limits of the law. And what I see happening with NAFTA is a Mexico that can buy more American products, where more Mexicans will want to stay home and be near their families because they will be able to make a living. And Mexico will be the leader of a whole new wave of trading partners for the United States, going down past Mexico into Central America, into Chile, into Venezuela, into Argentina, into other countries. I believe it will create jobs for America. I would not do it if I did not think so. And let me also tell you that there is beginning to be a little bit of a chill in the wind of people who think that they ought to just automatically move their plants to Mexico to save money. There is a big story just in the last day or so about General Motors moving 1,000 jobs back from Mexico to the United States to Michigan, a high-cost State with very productive labor, to produce some of their small cars. So I am very hopeful about this. And let me make one last point. About 4 years ago we had a $5 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Today, because of the trade barriers that Mexico has lowered, we have a $6 billion trade surplus, which means we have created more jobs because of trade with Mexico than we have lost because of jobs moving down there. Now, we do not want to just have a trade agreement with no standards. The Mexican people are going to have to be willing to work with us on environmental standards and on labor standards so we do not just open the floodgates to move jobs to Mexico in ways that will not even raise incomes in Mexico. But if we do it right, it will create jobs for both countries.

{"id": 3305, "text": "By contrast, are not things beginning to get better here? Well, they are beginning to get better here, and they are beginning to get better here basically for two reasons. First off, American industry was really battered here during the entire 1980's and in fact starting back in the mid-seventies. And there has been a determined effort by people running our firms in the private sector to become more competitive, so a lot of them are. And that increased productivity, increasing output per worker, the increasing ability to compete with countries around the world, that is helping things to get better. The second thing that is making things better is that this administration's serious effort to bring the deficit down has helped long-term interest rates to get down to their lowest rate in 20 years, and that is leading people to refinance, freeing up some money, and we are getting some more investment. But I do not want to mislead anybody. If you look at southern California, if you look at Connecticut, if you look at some of the States that have been hit especially hard by defense cutbacks of all kinds and other economic problems, we are still going to have to have a very disciplined plan to invest and grow our way out of the problems of the last few years. But yes, we are in better shape now than Europe and Japan. In fact, if we could get some more growth in those countries, we'd be in better shape because we are not selling as much to them as we would be because of their economic problems. They do not have the money to buy American products. And when I go to Japan in a couple of weeks to talk to the leaders of Europe and Japan, one of the things we are going to be talking about is that America is doing what they asked us to do; we are bringing our deficit down. And we want the Europeans to bring their interest rates down and the Japanese to invest some more money in their economy so they can grow it, because they do not have the deficit we do. And if we can work together, we can grow the world economy and that means jobs for America. But you are quite right, we are actually in better shape than Japan and Europe is right now, except for unemployment rates. Japan's still got a lower unemployment rate than we do.

And what we do is staying focused on what matters and chip away at it and try to make progress. People have health care. What I do worry about is that right now we have got a Republican Party that seems to only care about saying no to me. You have got Speaker Boehner talking about suing you for executive actions that he says has crossed the line. He says we elected a president; we did not elect a monarch or a king. Well, you notice that he did not specifically say what exactly he was objecting to. I am not going to apologize for trying to do something while they are doing nothing. But what I have told Speaker Boehner directly is, if you are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, why do not you try getting something done through Congress. The majority of the American people want to see immigration reform done. We had a bipartisan bill through the Senate, and you are going to squawk if I try to fix some parts of it administratively that are within my authority while you are not doing anything? You mentioned immigration. Do not come; if you come, you will be deported. Actually, we have done that. The problem is is that, under current law, once those kids come across the border, there is a system in which we are supposed to process them, take care of them until we can send them back. Do not send your children unaccompanied on trains or through a bunch of smugglers. That is our direct message to the families in Central America. If they do make it, they will get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it. Let us talk about Iraq. How serious is this ISIS threat to people here in Minnesota, around the country? I was so struck by an article that Ryan Crocker, who served as Iraq ambassador under you, wrote last week. Make no mistake.

Let me ask you a final question on foreign policy. It comes from something you wrote back in 2006 in Audacity of Hope. Without a well-articulated strategy that the public supports and the world understands, America will lack legitimacy and ultimately the power it needs to make the word safer than it is today. The majority of Americans do not support your path on foreign policy. Are you failing by your own standard? ENTITY, I not only go back to the polls, but let me just say that throughout the first half of my presidency, polls consistently showed strong support for my foreign policy and -- But the public has to support it, does not it? One of the things we also realized during the course of five years is that, if the problems were easy, somebody else would have solved them already. And one of the great challenges of this job but one of the great privileges of this job is that, you know, you are tackling stuff that is really tough.

One of those might have been difficult to do before the election; the other surely would've been difficult to do before the election, which makes me wonder - is there some way in which that election just passed has liberated you? Keep in mind that all these issues are ones that we have been working on for some time. It took about a year to arrive at the Cuba policy that was announced yesterday, including extensive negotiations with the Cuban government, meetings with the Vatican, making sure that we had looked at all the policy ramifications. And I was persuaded that ultimately this would be good for the Cuban people and more likely to lead to a loosening up of the restrictions or oppression that exists there. With respect to immigration reform, obviously I'd been working on that for six years. But this was the moment when you could do those things? Well, I do - here is what I do think is true - that, um, I have spent six years now in this office. We have dealt with the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. We have dealt with international turmoil that we have not seen in - in a lot of years. And I said at the beginning of this year that 2014 would be a breakthrough year - and it was a bumpy path. But at the end of 2014, I could look back and say we are as well-positioned today as we have been in quite some time economically; that American leadership is more needed around the world than ever before - and that is liberating in the sense that a lot of the work that we have done is now beginning to bear fruit. And it gives me an opportunity then to start focusing on some of the other hard challenges that I did not always have the time or the capacity to get to earlier in my - earlier in my presidency. Can I think of you as shifting from things you had to do to things you more want to do? Think about how much energy was required for us to yank ourselves out of the economic circumstances we were in when I came into office. That was a big lift and it took up a lot of time.

On education, we really wanted to dig in and make sure that we started reforming a system that was not serving our kids well for the competitive 21st century environment. So, these were all big structural shifts that we had to do. I could - I put immigration on that list and was frustrated that we were not able to get legislation. And - and so, the executive action was, in some ways, just a first step in what I hope will be a continuing effort going forward. But it - what is true is that I am in a position now where, with the economy relatively strong, with us having lowered the deficit, with us having strong growth and job growth, for the first time us starting to see wages ticking up, with inflation low, with energy production high - now I have the ability to focus on some long-term projects, including making sure that everybody is benefiting from this growth and not just some. And on the international front, you know, even as we are managing ISIL and trying to roll them back and ultimately defeat them, even as we have been executing the draw down in Afghanistan in a responsible way, the moves like the Cuba diplomatic initiative are ones that I want to make sure I continue to pursue partly because, frankly, a - it is easier for ENTITY to do at the end of his term than a new president coming in. You were able to start Cuba without Congress; able to start on immigration without Congress. Each of those issues cannot be fully resolved without Congress.

And, you know, what I have said repeatedly is that I want to work with them; I want to get things done. I do not have another election to run. There are going to be areas where we agree and I am going to be as aggressive as I can be in getting legislation passed that I think help move the economy forward and help middle class families. There are going to be some areas where we disagree and, you know, I have not used the veto pen very often since I have been in office, partly because legislation that I objected to was typically blocked in the Senate even after the House took over - Republicans took over the House.

Well, let me figure out if there is overlap on immigration. In an interview in August, you described the Republican Party as being captive to nativist elements of the party. What did you mean by that and can you work with people who you think of in that way? Well, on immigration, I probably cannot ; I am - Steve King and I fundamentally disagree on immigration.

I - I think the Republican Party contains a lot of legislators who recognize that; and we know that because those folks voted for a comprehensive bill in the Senate that in many ways was more generous than I was able to offer through executive action. So - so, the question then becomes, by me having taken these actions, does that spur those voices in the Republican Party who I think genuinely believe immigration is good for our country? Does it spur them to work once again with Democrats and my administration to get a reasonable piece of legislation done? Or does it simply solidify what I do think is - is a nativist trend in parts of the Republican Party? And - and if it is the latter, then probably we are not going to get much more progress done and it'll be a major debate in the next presidential election. I think that if a Republican lawmaker was sitting here, he might say, Wait a minute. I am not captive to nativist elements. I have actual concerns and you are not addressing them. Well, the problem is what are those concerns and - and how is it that I am not addressing them? If - if the concern is border security, we have got more resources, more border police, more money being spent at our borders than any time in the last 30, 40 years. If the concern is the flow of illegal workers into the country, that flow is about half of what it was and is lower than any time since the 1970s. So, you know, you have to describe specifically what are the concerns that you have got. If you are concerned that somehow immigrants - illegal immigrants are a drain on resources and forcing, you know, Americans to - to pay for services for these folks, well, every study shows that is just not the case.

But I actually think that the issue has surfaced in a way that probably is healthy. I mean, the - the issue of police and communities of color being mistrustful of each other is hardly new; that dates back a long time. It is just something that has not been talked about - and for a variety of reasons.

There is a case where there was a grand jury investigation that was released; there were thousands of pages of testimony; people went around reading them - I certainly did. And in the end, surveys showed that majorities of white people thought the grand jury was right not to indict the officer who shot Michael Brown; majorities of African Americans found the grand jury was wrong. How do you lead the country when people see the basic facts so profoundly differently? Not new, but how do you deal with it in your final...

From the perspective of African Americans, yeah, there was a common, you know, phenomenon called driving while black - that you were more likely to be stopped particularly in certain jurisdictions. If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions do you think traffic stops were done fairly, the majority of whites probably would say yes because it is not something they experi-ence. It is not because of racism; it is just that it is not something that they see. We were able to work with the police departments and the state police in Illinois and persuade them that they would be doing a better job policing if we just kept track so that we had data. And combined with training, suddenly those officers out there are more intentional about how they decide should I stop somebody or not. And the incidents of racial profiling went down. The same is true with a lot of these issues. If you have good policing - I guarantee you that nobody's interested more in good policing than African American community or Latino community because they are more likely to be victimized, if they are in low income communities, by crime. And the task force that I have put together is drawing from police and faith community and civic leaders and activists - and what is been striking to me in the conversations we have had is - is that they are interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country. And - and - and I am convinced that we actually are going to see progress on this issue next year. Let me ask about another data point that reflects on the Democratic Party that you will want to leave behind in a... Couple of years - and this is something that has changed in recent years. As everybody knows, the coalition that is elected you twice included huge minority participation - record minority participation. You had huge percentages... The white vote for Democrats has gone down to rather dramatic levels, which suggests a political division between races that is different than it used to be.

I do think that right now there are a lot of white working class voters who have not seen enough progress economically in their own lives, and despite the work that we have done to try to strengthen the economy and address issues like child care or minimum wage or increasing manufacturing, that is not what they read about or hear about in the newspapers. They hear about an immigration debate or they hear about, you know, debate surrounding Ferguson, and they think, I am being left out. Nobody seems to be thinking about how tough it is for me right now, or I have been down-scaled, I have lost my job, et cetera.

We are fighting for you. And one of the best examples of this is the Affordable Care Act, which - if you were just looking at the way it is been couched and characterized by the Republican Party, and in some cases by the news, the perception is somehow that this is largely something that is benefiting black and Hispanic and downscale voters. Well, the truth of the matter is that a state like Kentucky that does not have a massive black or Hispanic population has been one of the strongest states - Mitch McConnell's state's one of the best states in using the Affordable Care Act to insure huge numbers of working class white voters. It is just they do not call it Obamacare; they call it something else. And - and so, there is sometimes a gap in perceptions that we have to bridge. I think there is a legitimate sense of loss, particularly among men, who have seen manufacturing diminish; construction has been in the tank. The jobs that are out there are not ones that are traditionally jobs that, you know, blue collar men aspire to. And, you know, we have got to speak to those concerns.

But he was absolutely right in his position on - on promoting comprehensive immigration reform, reaching out to the Latino community, and as a consequence, did pretty well.

You know, Cuba is a circumstance in which for 50 years, we have done the same thing over and over again and there had not been any change. And the question was, should we try something different with a relatively tiny country that does not pose any significant threat to us or our allies? Tehran is a large, sophisticated country that has a track record of state-sponsored ter-rorism, that we know was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon, or at least the component parts that would be required to develop a nuclear weapon; that has engaged in disruptions to our allies; whose rhetoric is not only explicitly anti-American but also has been incendiary when it comes to its attitude towards the state of Israel.

You know, I was asked very early in my - my presidential race back in 2007 - would I meet with these various rogue regimes? And what I said then remains true. If I thought it advances American interests, yes; I believe in diplomacy, I believe in dialogue, I believe in engagement. But in order for us to I think open that aperture with respect to Iran, we have to get this nuclear issue resolved - and there is a chance to do it and the question's going to be whether or not Iran is willing to seize it. I think there are elements inside of Iran that recognize the opportunity and want to take it; I think there is some hardliners inside of Iran that are threatened by a resolution of this because they are so invested politically and emotionally in being anti-American or anti-Western that - that it is frightening for them to - to open themselves up to the world in this way.

I think we do because if you - if you look at the negotiations as they have proceeded, what we have said to the Iranians is that we are willing to recognize your ability to develop a modest nuclear power program for your energy needs - that there is a way of doing that that nevertheless gives the world assurances that you do not have breakout capacity.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio1", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-1", "publication_date": "18-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

They have legitimate defense concerns - but those have to be separated out from the adventurism, the support of organizations like Hezbollah, the threats they have directed towards Israel. And - and so, on the one hand, you need to understand what their legitimate needs and concerns are. On the other end, you do not need to tolerate or make excuses for positions that they have taken that violate international law, are contrary to U.S. interests, are contrary to the interests of our allies. They have got a chance to get right with the world. This is not just about us. I mean, there is a reason why we have been able to get this far in the negotiations. We mobilized the international community at the start of my presidency - a classic example of American leadership. The sanctions worked because we did not just get our usual allies' support of this; we got China in support of it; we have Russia that still is supportive of the position that the P5+1 has taken in negotiations. So, when I came into office, the world was divided and Iran was in the driver's seat. Now the world's united because of the actions we have taken and Iran's the one that is isolated. They have a path to break through that isolation and they should seize it. Because if they do, there is incredible talent and resources and sophistication inside of - inside of Iran and it would be a very successful regional power that was also abiding by international norms and international rules - and that would be good for everybody. That would be good for the United States, that would be good for the region, and most of all, it would be good for the Iranian people. One other question, ENTITY - in a speech in September, you spoke of the United States' legacy of freedom, is the phrase that you used. You spoke of preserving that and wanting to extend it. I want to ask about efforts to extend the idea of freedom or democracy around the world, particularly in the Middle East. You disagreed with invading Iraq partly to de-mocratize that country. You had your own efforts - and Egypt has not turned out very well... It came full circle and it is back under military rule.

I think it is important to distinguish between the actions that we take to promote democracy and human rights and rule of law and good governance and the humility to understand that, in the end, these things are going to happen because the people in these countries demand them. Let me just move out of the Middle East momentarily and then we will swing back. This is one of the most isolated countries for the last 40 years, ruled by a brutal, repressive military junta. We seized that opportunity. We engaged with Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Prize winner, but we also engaged with President Sein, who saw that Burma was traveling down a dead end. They had parliamentary elections for the first time. They are now preparing to amend their constitution and schedule broader parliamentary elections. And there are all kinds of troubles in Burma; the experiment may go haywire. They may not be able to reconcile all the different ethnic groups inside the country; the military ultimately may not be willing to give up its prerogatives and its power. Now, we want to be on the side of those who can take advantage of that opportunity. I feel very confident, very good about the work we are doing there. But I cannot guarantee success because ultimately it is going to be up to the Burmese people and Burmese leaders to seize this moment. The Middle East, I think, is - is similar, but in some ways even more difficult. Because you have this counter-narrative in the Middle East in which a sizable portion of Islamic extremists have been able to penetrate the imaginations of young people there; you have govern - governments that oftentimes are creaky, do not serve their people, are repressive; you do not have a civic tradition there. And so, you have to almost start from scratch in many of these countries. What we can do is to be opportunistic and find places where somebody's ready and willing to move forward and do everything we can to help - and Tunisia's a great example of that. Not perfect - still dangerous, still troublesome; but you have seen a civil society develop, elections take place, a constitution get drafted, Islamists being willing to be involved in the political process without trying to take it over completely and accommodations to the fact that economic and social reforms are required for that country to succeed.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio1", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-1", "publication_date": "18-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3357, "text": "You have not seen it in Libya; it is broken off into tribal elements. Which raises a question - is there a responsibility by the United States to do more in Libya, having been involved in... I - I think that the challenge that we are going to have is a recognition that we are hugely influential; we are the one indispensable nation. But when it comes to nation-building, when it comes to what is going to be a generational project in a place like Libya or a place like Syria or a place like Iraq, we can help, but we cannot do it for them. Now, I think the American people recognize that. There are times here in Washington where pundits do not ; they think you can just move chess pieces around the table. And whenever we have that kind of hubris, we tend to get burned. Where we are successful is where we see an opportunity, we put resources in, we support those who are trying to do the right thing for their society; and every so often, something breaks. But - but I think that one of the things I have learned over six years, and it does not always suit the news cycle, is having some strategic patience. You will recall that three or four months ago, everybody in Washington was convinced that President Putin was a genius... And he had outmaneuvered all of us and he had, you know, bullied and, you know, strategized his way into expanding Russian power. And I said at the time we do not want war with Russia but we can apply steady pressure working with our European partners, being the backbone of an international coalition to oppose Russia's violation of another country's sovereignty, and that over time, this would be a strategic mistake by Russia. And today, you know, I'd - I'd sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did was not so smart. Are you just lucky that the price of oil went down and therefore their cur-rency collapsed or... Is it something that you did? And part of our rationale in this process was that the only thing keeping that economy afloat was the price of oil.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio1", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-1", "publication_date": "18-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3358, "text": "And if, in fact, we were steady in applying sanction pressure, which we have been, that over time it would make the - the economy of Russia sufficiently vulnerable that if and when there were disruptions with respect to the price of oil - which inevitably, there are going to be sometime, if not this year then next year or the year after - that they'd have enormous difficulty managing it. I - I say that, not to suggest that we have solved Ukraine, but I am saying that to - to give an indication that when it comes to the international stage, these problems are big, they are difficult, they are messy. But wherever we have been involved over the last several years, I think the outcome has been better because of American leadership. Because of American leadership, not only have we not seen another Ebola case here in the United States - and when we do, we will be prepared for it - but internationally, resources, medics, testing, science has poured into poor countries. We are practically rebuilding their public health infrastructure because of our leadership. It does not happen in two weeks; it does not happen in - in four weeks. But if we are steady about it and we are focused and we are clear that we possess capacities as well as values that require us to engage, that we will be successful. Just to wrap this up with this idea that you began with, of doing things that you want to do rather than... Have to do, has your limited response to ISIS in Iraq and Syria been driven in part by a sense that this is a very dangerous threat, but not the biggest problem the United States faces in the world, and you do not want to be distracted from far bigger things going on elsewhere? I think we cannot underestimate the danger of ISIL. They are a terrorist network that, unlike Al Qaeda, has not limited itself to the periodic attack but have aspirations to control large swaths of territory, that possess resources and effectively an army that pose great dangers to our allies and can destabilize entire regions that are very dangerous for us. So, I - I do not want to downplay that threat. It is a real one; it is the reason why I have authorized, as part of a broader 60 nation coalition, an effort to fight back and to push them back and ultimately destroy them.

Our energy resources, both conventional and clean energy resources, put most other of our competitors to shame. Demographically, we have got a young population, in part because of immigration. We have got the best universities in the world; we have got the best workers in the world. Our manufacturing base has come roaring back, led by the auto industry, but not restricted by it. Our deficits I have cut by two-thirds. And so, if you look out towards the future, America is in a great position and our military is more capable than any military in history. We do not really have a serious peer, at least on the conventional level, although obviously Russia is a - is a significant nuclear power. The question then becomes, alright, how do we play those cards well? Part of it is at-tending to immediate problems like ISIL; part of it is making sure that we are firm in upholding international norms as we have been in Ukraine; part of it is managing short-term crises that could turn into long-term disasters if we are not attentive, like Ebola. But ultimately, the thing that is most dangerous for the United States is us not tending to the very sources of our strength. So, it is true that when it comes to ISIL, us devoting another trillion dollars after having been involved in big occupations of countries that did not turn out all that well - I am very hesitant to do that because we need to spend a trillion dollars rebuilding our schools, our roads, our basic science and research here in the United States; that is going to be a recipe for our long-term security and success. And what we have also learned is that if we do for others what they need to do for themselves - if we come in and send the Marines in to fight ISIL and the Iraqis have no skin in the game, then it is not going to last. When we look at an issue like Ukraine, we have to be firm with the Russians but we have also got to make sure that we have got our own fiscal house in order; we got to make sure that we are doing what we need to do to build our manufacturing base because ultimately, the big advantage we have with Russia is we have got a dynamic, vital economy, and they do not .

{"id": 3362, "text": "On immigration, Valerie Jarrett was quoted in Las Vegas as saying that there is a window between now and August to get immigration overhaul done. And she says, We have a commitment from Speaker Boehner, who is very frustrated with his caucus. And in a tweet today, Valerie herself said that this was lost in translation and that she actually meant that it was a commitment to trying. But I guess the question is -- a commitment to trying what and when? Speaker Boehner, other House Republican leaders and leading Republicans outside of the House of Representatives have all expressed deep interest in moving forward on immigration reform. And we have found those comments and that interest to be encouraging and indicative of some movement among Republicans in the House towards support for comprehensive immigration reform. What the President has said and others have said is that the opportunity before us is something very rare and we ought to seize it here in Washington, all of us. The House ought to follow the Senate's lead and pass comprehensive immigration reform. In the Senate, a comprehensive bill passed with Democratic and Republican support. Republicans across the country, business leaders across the country, faith leaders and law enforcement leaders across the country are behind this effort. They recognize that passing comprehensive immigration reform will provide a huge boost to our economy, to our security, to principles of fairness. And for those reasons we ought to move forward, and what we hope is that the House will move. And that is a message that Valerie was carrying and that we have all been carrying for some time now. Is the suggestion here that if does not happen by August, or at the end of August -- have an August recess -- that the President will take matters into his own hands, he has some authority to do some things -- that we do something beyond just tweaking the margins? Well, I am not going to speculate about the future. What we have always said will always remain true, which is comprehensive immigration reform requires action by Congress. The President is always interested in moving the ball forward on his agenda where he can, even if Congress refuses to act. But there are some things that require congressional action, and this is one of them. So the Senate acted in this Congress, and has put a bill forward that enjoys broad bipartisan support across the country in communities and among interest groups that do not often get together behind the same priority.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-124", "publication_date": "16-05-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We should get this done for our security.

So the opportunity is there for the taking, and we hope that the Speaker and other Republican leaders in the House avail themselves of the opportunity. A question on Ukraine -- reports today of pro-Russian insurgents pulling out of buildings, government buildings in the city of Mariupol. And this is because steelworkers employed by one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine are patrolling the streets with police officers. I am wondering, is that a welcome development at the White House? Or is there a concern that the government in Kyiv is relying on oligarchs to essentially run the government in these tense regions? Well, I am not sure that is how I would interpret the story that you are referring to. We certainly welcome any indication that separatists that have seized buildings, who have set up roadblocks, stockpiled weapons, are vacating buildings and ceasing the kinds of activities that have only destabilized the situation in Ukraine and led to confrontations and violence. And the fact that significant portions of the population in Ukraine, including in eastern Ukraine, do not support the agenda of Russian-backed separatists but support a united Ukraine and support a process by which decisions around constitutional reform and devolution of power from the center are made in an appropriate way -- that is a good thing. These are the kinds of issues that the Ukrainian government in Kyiv has promised will be discussed in dialogue with Ukrainians from all parts of the country at roundtables that are facilitated by the OSCE. And all of this comes as we move closer now to a presidential election on May 25. And our focus and the focus of the OSCE and the Ukrainian government and all of our partners in this effort is on ensuring that those elections are able to go forward.

You have talked a lot about the issue with China and Vietnam, and wanting that to be resolved in a way that is diplomatic and without provocation. Do you want China to move the oil tanker? Here is what I'd say about that -- and I appreciate the question. First of all, we are closely following, out of our mission to Vietnam, the protests in Vietnam around this issue. But regarding the broader issue of China's unilateral decision to introduce an oil rig accompanied by numerous government vessels for the first time in waters disputed with Vietnam, we would say what we have said repeatedly, which is this is a provocative act and it raises tensions in the region, and by raising tensions makes it more difficult to resolve claims over disputed territory in a manner that supports peace and stability in the region. So we consider that act provocative and we consider it one that undermines the goal that we share, which is a peaceful resolution of these disputes and general stability in the region. We are very concerned about dangerous conduct and intimidation by government-controlled assets operating in this area. And we call on all parties to conduct themselves in a safe and professional manner to preserve freedom of navigation and overflight, to exercise restraint, to take steps to lower tensions, and to address competing sovereignty claims peacefully and in accordance with international law. As you know, sovereignty over these islands, the Paracel Islands, is disputed. This is occurring in waters claimed by both Vietnam and China near those islands.
